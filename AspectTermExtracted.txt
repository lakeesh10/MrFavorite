lack special tastebuds or something... haha verrrry confused huge majority people here yelp n't enough 
normally shrimp & grits and catfish po boy 
enjoy sharing dishes , shrimp & grits quite heavy and n't imagine just solely eating huge bowl cheesy grits 
grits indeed very flavorful cheesy , salty , sweet ( tomatoes & yummy sauce lies top ) , well texturally pleasant ( caramelized onions , green onions , tomatoes , shrimp , and course cheeeeese ) 
served fries or coleslaw.... obviously picked fries 
become queen brunching ridiculously popular places and longer deterred waiting times up hour or longer food 
, large blackboards front restaurant where sign name and note party size , and blackboards visible everyone how close or far away seated 
honestly , standards here bit low... several 4-star places honestly barely star meal quality focus , or maybe too critical , ha 
beignet sugary fried dough , also known doughnut , need freak out.but order the...crawfish beignets $ 3.50 ) spiced w/ cayenne , scallions & cheddar : received fist-sized puffed-up orange pillows 
brenda fried chicken , cream biscuit , hot pepper jelly & collard greens : chicken pretty good , hot and juicy legs and slightly drier breast 
collard greens nice and tasty too.catfish po'boy ( $ 13.75 w/ chipotle rmoulade toasted french roll , w/ fries or cole slaw : good crunchy catfish , but filet rather small 
ever drag butt here brunch , eggs benedict or gumbo try 
& probably sweet beignets pure curiosity 
crispy pork belly & grits super yummy 
order big beignets.shrimp & grits ( 5/5 love love dish 
rest sandwich little grilled ham & cheese 
matter type , atmosphere plays big part and star or thinks great charm.1 star service great meal bad service 
ordered pork belly & grits , shrimp & grits , beignet flight , buttermilk biscuits , and bowl mixed fruit ...lol ) 
pork belly & grits , lot fat well whole poached egg 
early or prepared wait , especially weekend brunch 
first things first , , especially plan brunch or lunch 
enjoyed.- shrimp & grits : not huge fan grits , but cheesy , baconed styled ways made delicious 
wonder favorite.- shrimp something something jasmine rice special ( forgot name , full seasoned flavor & remember , perhaps not impressionable aforementioned dishes , but still stellar.- french toast w/ pecan sauce : bf & friend really enjoyed , , but aforementioned entrees more impressionable comparison 
, & n't forget watermelon iced tea 
place probably n't reviews or repeating how glorious , but enthusiastic praise 
tofu , potatoes , spinach , mushrooms and side biscuit , toast , or fruit 
rather recommend quality places flora or brown sugar kitchen satisfying brunch willing explore fresher , accessible , and simply real dining scene oakland 
small & wait time average 1-1.5 hours 
effective & low energy method 
back just order those... & try grits 
love shrimp & grits but bigger benedict fan 
, good but definitely n't waking early or waiting line 
apple super dry , wish sort syrup or flavor 
way close ones cafe du monde orleans but best had california .overall 3.2 
delicious thing omelet melted cheddar cheese and not hard melt cheese or taste good .the worst items fathers omelet and potato hash 
observe restaurant , always people eating crawfish beignets or dessert beignets plain , apple , or chocolate , so not only person loves beignets 
cup coffee or cafe au lait and n't regret 
great place brunch , or meal day just wait and very conveniently located restaurant tourists staying downtown area feel brunch-fanatic-san franciscan-fusion-eclectic-localish feel 
topped paprika or similar powder 
almost regretted not ordering shrimp & grits time but back next time 
friends far & , heard beignets and other great brunch options 
, glad finally report back indeed , accolades & recommendations on-point and brenda so 
not worth ridiculous wait opinion , so come early or weekdaysfinally ever-so-popular brenda 
beignet dough pretty bland , not even lightly sweetened or anything , but amazing texture 
crawfish [ w/ cayenne , scallions & cheddar ] 3.5/5 love savory things , including savory pastries and such 
quite flavorful or memorable thought.-bfc ( $ 12.75 4/5 [ pieces fried chicken w/ fries , cole slaw & cream biscuit ] subbed fries salad fried chicken fries felt too much me. 
grillades & grits and only complaint n't bigger stomach fit 
ordered : beignet flight : crawfish plain shrimp & gritsgrillades & gritschicken gumbosweet potato hashall-in-all food decent , but definitely underwhelming 
pretty sure lady who served manager or supervisor or someone charge 
grillades & grits unique dish really good flavor gravy 
expect long waiting list chalkboard peak or brunch hours 
atmosphere nice n't too loud or too quiet , so friend and able good catch-up date 
also ordered shrimp & grits ; delicious taste mouth 
chicken fry catfish oil or something gave weird taste 
dish very healthy indeed , bit bland ketchup or maybe offered salsa 
dishes pretty heavy , so something little lighter , suggest chicken , sausage & okra gumbo and ordering biscuit side 
mind something else and menu order or beignets $ 5- $ or opt sampler ( total $ 10 , right ? 
so much food , n't finish half it.my friend boyfriend shrimp & goat cheese omelette 
paid meal and less $ 75 alcoholic drinks mimosa & bloody mary , beignet appetizer , breakfasts , and additional order pancakes 
plain , chocolate , apple , & crawfish 
unbalanced batter filling proportion and not very pillowy or soft beignets : missed mark me.however , shrimp & grits delicious and highly recommended 
food : shrimp & grits small portion , but super heavy dish... reminded thick cheesy porridge shrimp 
packed flavor , grits bit sweeter side , shrimp savory & cheesy 
friends and family not late or else not seated 
main course , ended grillade & grits recommended waitress actually just everything house favorite favorite..

shrimp & grits very good , but grits acquired taste 
ambiance pretty cute , wall art nice and nice environment friend catch or girlfriends 
food hit or miss customers but overall very enjoyable

chocolate dessert & crawfish app

wait about 10-15 minutes or so not bad 
food-wise... friend ordered shrimp & grits very pleased

right amount shrimp , tomato & bacon gravy , grits and cheddar cheese 
shrimp & grits so showed saturday and large crowd waiting outside , inside full so decided back later , outside line good just names ahead 
mixed greens , crispy fried shallots and spicy toasted pecans spicy honey mustard,cream biscuits light fluffy and deliciousfried chicken really good and bit peppery,beignets- sweet ones really good , but most reviews read n't fond savory crawfish- cayenne powder outside unpleasant tongue.ghirardelli chocolate pot du creme- really good and course chocolaty 
arrived few sundays ago 11 : 00 and table 11 : 50 or so 
grits hit or miss , but not 
thing or wines 
maybe lucky or maybe place really n't as good as everyone is.i philz grab coffee brunch and as soon as walked , told there outside drinks allowed inside restaurant 
, happily nick soulful restaurant to-eat-in-sf list , and way : brenda street or away eternally beloved philz coffee 
biscuits & gravy probably best had , and oyster omelette surprisingly good ( tasted even better hot sauce ) 
bit worried lunch wait door but so determined brenda already looked menu online & knew what order 
n't choose fries or coleslaw , half 
order piece bfc meal mac n cheese and collard greens , or order bfc sides.that , forced something different time 3rd time brendas ) 
, lawd.the only dish really impressed catfish des allemandes 
shrimp & grits ( : highly recommended but afraid n't enjoy much 
totally worth wait -kristen5 stars edmund & stars kristen5 stars ^ __ ^ told place brunch line and wait 
, must-try early or plan wait table 
pros- food good , staff warm and welcoming.cons- tiny sitting cramped.tip- weekends crazy busy prepare wait or week day 
finally brenda year intending , & not disappointed 
beignet sampler and shrimp & grits 
apple & plain beignets okay , but n't order again much rather crawfish and/or chocolate ones 
shrimp & grits also pretty amazing , & probably order again too 
finally , biscuit probably best biscuit ever had restaurant.update : back & pancakes & fried chicken eggs benedict & ordered crawfish beignets again , love ) 
pancakes super fluffy & possibly best pancakes ever n't special fillings/toppings 
fried chicken eggs benedict also really good & definitely order again too 
also soft and fresh over biscuit or toast and very bland and over cooked " hash browns " or grits perfectly fine just omelet ordered shrimp po-boy fries or coleslaw and devoured so quick 
awarded brenda or , but spilling maple syrup jacket and not giving discount or manager not apologizing unacceptable 
owner brenda reads , 20 % check or least plate beignets 
, update review or stars 
sucker anything classic & plain , but crawfish beignets game changer 
also pork belly cheesy grits & poached egg 
started chocolate donut and grillades & grits $ 11.75 beef cutlets braised spicy creole gravy , served grits & eggs style , plus cream biscuit or toast .both dishes ridiculously delicious 
suggest line early brunch or long wait , dinner not much 
n't south beignet and grits anymore... just contend 90-minute wait times.---- food ----beignet flight : 4.5 starsthere many styles beignets cafe du monde and cafe beignet orleans , former crispier wonton-style beignets and other softer doughier ones 
n't sure portion sizes so also ordered scrambled eggs and grits and husband ordered andouille sausage & cheddar omelette and grits 
highly recommend ordering something comes grits side or adding grits meal 
benedicts only available weekends.tried beignet flight traditional delicious chocolate too sweet apple pie alright craw fish winnerhangtown fry biscuit dry not stingy oystersshrimp & grits heavy but very good 
stingy shrimp loved cheese top needed container & n't taste great heated up.watermelon tea dealt withoutwould back ?

waited full hours , told hour hour & 15 ) and even host teased and calling name then told just there , then and second time and telling table waiting paying painful news when hangry ) agreed left worth wait 
watermelon iced excellent , bloody mary good , but n't recommend guava mimosa , tasted cheap champagne- cheap champagne or not difference 
really n't melted cheese or secret cream sauce grits , but flavor spot 
people just looked homeless and food tainted or something 
beignets as good as cafe du monde.the ambiance really cool 
best fried chicken city and perfect buttermilk biscuits ever , collard greens , & delicious hot pepper jelly 
stuck btwn 2.5 or stars.. but ended stars yelp halfsies.. and why decision.the bf & sf quick mini vacay and only full day spend sf 
lukewarm or cold and not overall good experience 
here party thursday afternoon 11 : 30 or so 
brunch or meal here , food touches soul 
pulled pork benedict , shrimp and grits & beignets flight made wait worthwhile 
scramble and beignets left much desired nola-obsessed cade du monde-aholic ) 
waiting area seat or togo orders n't too big 
crowded or made feel peoples way 
hot inside , more stuffy and humid , or more grease 
location or little saigon sf 
pretty upset lunch n't serve mac n cheese or collard greens , really wanted 
fried chicken eggs benedict heavy meal and w/ choice grits or hash 
wait and server making feel slightly rushed or order , brenda something satisfy everyone 
n't been here while but pretty good friend chicken and super good small place so there off hour or prepared wait while 
shadier part city so taking cab or walking group recommended visiting city.the service and organizational flow superb 
prices more or less reasonable , given city standard , and location just so feel hidden spot just , even really n't 
but really , cream biscuits -- back and order nothing but or 
coffee critical part breakfast or brunch , and southern-style chicory blend terrific 
n't why place so highly reviewed or loved...imho , dishes not outstanding 
hmmm...maybe palate bit too spoiled or sophisticatedwe here lunch and started beignet flight 
lacked distinct or outstanding flavor 
chocolate best.shrimp & gritsthe grits strange...i n't , not much texture and bit sweet finish 
more variation minestrone soup.bfcagain , just regular piece fried chicken , flavor or special spices

overall good food & great customer service 
cute , but makes nasty noise.fatty details : beignet sampler : crawfish , apple , chocolate , and regular beignets : crawfish though.yum shrimp & grits : shrimp cooked perfection , but overall dish too heavy and saucy finish 
ill back but next time ill try chicken or fried pork chop 
wait bit long weekends but running list chalkboard , so always walk coffee or tenderloin farmer market pick few things sunday 
typically draw line about 45 minutes , usually hangry or delirious beyond time 
tip , bring sunscreen or umbrella wait , hot there 
or monte cristo croque monsieur ? 
things know...crawfish beignet and shrimp & grits 
friend raved shrimp & grits so heading back desert 
table ordered shrimp & grits , flight beignets , coleslaw , and biscuit 
shrimp & grits amazing 
rude , condescending , & dismissive.this establishment benefit learning how treat people people 
refills or water and hard flag someone check waited while leaving quicker service seat parties 
sure leave room delicious fresh made stuffed or regular beignets ; 
probably n't here dark... or uber or cab 
food : hushpuppies , beignets sampler , shrimp po-boy , bfc , mac & cheese , pulled pork eggs benidict , bacon and watermellon iced tea... good n't fond pancakes.. 
shrimp & grits and friend bfc 
sharing good so dishes.this place gets busy so either come odd time or prepared wait 
had so far : shrimp & grits : 
order butter side , or else n't able taste grits.if brunch here way 10 ; place packed long wait stinky nasty neighborhood 
love shrimp & grits w/biscuit few other items menu also oyster duo , and beignets treat more stars could.. love place 
groups or , n't wait long 
just outside or sit bench outside. 
, hang 'cause not there when name called , seat next party.i wish bar or option drinks wait 
n't about roller coaster or experience amazing cultural phenomenon 
only so many ways cook egg or doughnut and none ways worth hours breakfast 
food : cup chicken , sausage & okra gumbo , $ 3.75 , order entire pot stuff time ? 
highly recommend place anyone visiting , or city , or anyone who just great food twist 
shrimp & grits : omg 
yes , yes , & yes.this place great 
$ 9.25 trio or flavor total ) $ 12.good parties or max-4 small and cozy so prepared wait long time weekends 
ready wait&wait&wait but once taste spoon full shrimp & grits tastebuds thanking 
bloody mary , shrimp & grits , pork belly & grits , & definitely crawfish beignet 
loved bite itshrimp & grits big fan grits , but dish amazing 
dough fluffy and not heavy or so nothing more 
apparently orange juice or guava juice mimosa 
waitress thought nuts or just alcoholics 
shrimp & grits 
here early 8-830am or evening skip wait 
sign name , walk block or so and grab philz coffee sweeten wait time , andorder shrimp& grits crab beignets glad did.i write essay how much love brenda , but pretty sure other yelper already beat 
yeah gillades & grits braised beef spicy creole gravy just melts mouth 
3.5 stars.brenda good , but crawfish beignets overrated or off day 
delicious beignets....powdered sugar , chocolate , or apple 
why people wait 1hr + highly recommend crawfish beignet and shrimp & grits makes place special 
beignet dough really good but crawfish meat same aftertaste chinese buffet crawfish & sauce kinda lacked flavor 
cute litle place date or mom 
( stars kickass meatloaf ( $ 14.75 daily specials spicy mound beef laden caramelized onions and paired mashed potatoes & gravy and sauteed veggies 
) , poboys , brendas own bfc and classic beignets twist apples or chocolate ? 
stick brunch or lunchtime and stay happy.what really steady stream black clientele dates or families , maybe louisiana transplants or , but very refreshing change kinda where grew usual sf restaurant crowd 
not great place diet , and n't lot low or medium-calorie options , only real reason why stars instead 5.that , fried chicken probably best fried chicken ever 
a-must ! shrimp & grits ( $ 12 hit here so something order 
begging crunch or alternative mouth-feel 
davy dish hearty perfect blend savory sweet & spicy kicker full and wanting even thought n't enough room 
food jus right not dry or seasoned , first time experience 100 % great definitely loved individuality chalk board and environment definitely back more 
very skeptical anything claiming creole , cajun , orleans or louisiana food , thought try 
, rivaled wille mae or praline connection fried chicken 
avoid normal rush lunch or dinner times.. , highly recommend pork belly cheese grits specialty and crawfish beignets 
favorite order- shrimp & grits heavy , more offset creamy , greasiness few slices watermelon pickle- watermelon tea nothing special , watermelon flavored black tea , not sure real watermelon juice used , but tastes bit artificial- shrimp poboy/catfish poboy heavy thousand island/messy- brenda fried chicken undersalted flavor , just fried breading , mediocre- chocolate beignets delicious , but n't more too much fried food meal 
done great job combining sausage , chicken , and veggies & herbs slowcooked thick but not too thick soup base and really warms soul 
, place really good , and back , but less busy hours or perhaps week 
kids skeptical & redeemed pick 
enjoyed those.definitely try : beignet flight or least crawfish ones , fried chicken eggs benedict , and mufaletta when menu 
, really place and chicory flavored coffee reminds cafe du monte 
wait few minutes and yet seated or even greeted 
skip french toast , nothing special.go early torture waiting tenderloin or always walk civic center wait 
favorite shrimp & grits 
crawfish beignet also interesting , really but hit or miss depending person 
mind , everything here good or maybe even what grew 
best had city , and same league nopa , live here.in short , dine here or food delivered postmates , place live here 
amazing food & good vibes , fast & friendly service well 
ordered : -beignet flight : perfect starter or dessert 
ask less or none 
-shrimp & grits : time grits 
sign chalk board and usually long wait stay inside or close hear name 
shrimp & grits go-tos southern-style brunch & brenda makes good w/ delicious tomato relish...drool 
angeline berkeley and aunt mary oakland cooking style more spicy , piquant , and complex.hangtown fry , $ 11 crispy oyster , bacon & scallion scramble , grits or hash , plus cream biscuit or toast : recommended 
favorite definitely chocolate or apple 
gingerly or else n't disintegrated , but just showed finesse creating such texturally sound biscuit 
eventually time , but now still highly recommend brenda top notch spot breakfast or brunch 
realistically , n't mean or rude , just inattentive 
good cafe du monde 
been fan beignet first visited cafe du monde and n't enough powdered , sugary fried dough chicory coffee 
try other beignets time crispy pork belly w/ cheddar grits & poached egg ( variety 
food delicious but not ones watching calories or waistline 
dining companion grillades & grits 
! previous visits , had shrimp & grits , bananas foster french toast special and been wanting again and andouille sausage &cheddar omelette 
early or weekday swing 
beignets bit good hear or 
water & iced tea glasses constantly empty and when wanted pay check , walked table twice , once holding check & credit card , oblivious 
weekday , or 3pm , but arrival party able seated right away 
shrimp & gritz- probably best other food items ordered 
also good walk fairmont francisco hill urban area sf downtown , complete skid row type neighborhood.we greeted soon entered good thing n't sure seated or seat ourselves.the menu short and sweet and " almost " very quickly minds.chicken touffe : very good.chicken , sausage and okra gumbo : tummy warming comfort food beignet flight plain , chocolate , crawfish , and apple : 
chocolate probably been yummy nutella or ghiradelli chocolate : pafterwards , sooo damn full , ridiculous 
place made 7x7 or bucket list , and therefore appealing so-called trendy crowds 
beignet flight and shrimp & grits 
waiter looked unamused and just gave vibe n't there or n't group there 
making eye contact shortly check card or cash already been placed picked 
spread really good toast.btw , constantly yell corner when walk or kitchen 
parents thought music little loud responded just old ) but playing old school soul and actually added enjoyment.really must-try , definitely plan ahead wait.eager back breakfast and try french toast & beignets maybe not same trip ) 
, usually stay 45 mins hour or longer guests 
last time checked free country and sign outside food or drink 
live here and love grits , or brenda 
also small cup pickled cinnamon apple or least what lol 
just crappy batches , twice.i 've fried chicken , grits , and french toast , tasted similar other restaurants make same food.i n't chicken memorable or even fantastic.their grits watery , and french toast takes other brunch places french toast , sweeter 
contemplating or not here making life goddamn complicated and just 
everything been excellent recommend people order shrimp and grits or shrimp po boy main dish...and crawfish bengits 
delicious dad grillades & grits and thought beef lacking flavor.i guess n't menu , food here extremely rich 
pork belly & grits and so good 
just wish labeled toothpick flag or something just ended eating random order and wish worked spicy sweet or something.if ever back sf , definitely back and try brenda again 
not baby backs so there , and bbq sauce n't meat or tastebuds favors either 
table ordered adults & kids 
list easy & simple : crawfish beignets asked extra pepper powder top kids n't 
crispy pork belly & cheese grits spicy onion relish top , and poached egg solid dish , but not care too much spicy opinion relish here 
enjoyable & again 
compared main dish not very flavorful so ended adding hot sauce not sure thats normal or not but yolo 
loved wall full mirrors location block or hill

good , but n't pack much flavor hoped.as main course , shrimp & grits 
time there breakfast , , hitting grillades & grits.so handle wait or n't mind sitting counter and reasonably great interpretation southern/creole food , means brenda french soul food 
beignet thicker and doughier cafe du monde version , so whole experience much heavier cheese and creamy crawfish stuffing.- broiled oysters flight- flavors spicy , bbq sauce , and creamy white sauce bacon 
friends pulled pork benedict or something 
crispy & hot fried chicken , juicy and perfectly cooked 
n't even taste watermelon...just regular iced tea -__-overall : brenda place breakfast or brunch , egg benedics

beat eager 10am beavers , or people just tired waiting sun , party able seated 20-30 minutes , waters and juice hand.the place n't biggest place world , but quaint atmosphere adds experiences 
recommend crawfish beignets , shrimp & grits and fried catfish benedict unanimously bursting cajun flavor and equally fatty and satisfying 
few years later.. but cause visiting weekday & knew n't long wait started flight beignets 
pork belly cooked perfection & so flavorful 
infused philippino foods such lumpia , or adobo chicken ? 
suggest little crawfish joints , or hushpuppies 
nice enough , however when clearly forget order , n't just cheapest item ordered & everything a-okay 
beignet filled mixture cayenne spiced crawfish , scallions & cheddar 
early or prepared wait forever 
walking hoards people waiting , name wait list and told 45 minute wait , walked other store , libby jane , coffee and tea & biscuit , n't

( n't here too late , or wait forever 
highlights touffe and shrimp & grits 
n't matter breakfast , lunch , or dinner , crawfish beignets.other beignets pretty solid 
probably different side instead mac & cheese ) .oyster po'boy delicious fried oysters toasted french roll 
and n't forget name chalkboard inside restaurant begin wait period.two dishes undoubtedly love here... crawfish beignets and shrimp & grits 
time order breakfast or lunch 
swear written or reviews place already and idea what happens them.i 'm too lazy expound but beignets

shrimp & grits , or crispy pork belly & grits ( special ( far favorite 
paprika/chili based seasoning top beignets little dusty , but n't inhale or anything , so nicely executed opinion 
probably lightest breakfasts , but means small or insubstantial 
gave friend and actually far superior what had had orleans , so maybe need there just beignets anymore , lol taking star lunch line long , and place too small people , so maybe expanding place or reservations , but other , great food , especially beignets 
shrimp & grits grits best ever 
so ordered " flight " different flavored beignets plain , chocolate , apple , & crawfish ) but just , just buy or filling.i ahead and ordered eggs benedict fried chicken , lays biscuit instead typical english muffin ) , poached egg and yummy cajun sauce instead typical hollandaise sauce ) grits side 
but not really grits ; way more sauce and cheese grits handle , tomato sauce/gravy sweet side but shrimp cooked well & not overcooked 
conclusion : not again line or suggest , but friend wanted 
hush puppies scrumptious & dipping sauce great 
shrimp & grits amazing 
n't group more people or less ideal.the food : amazing

n't set server table or section ; always 3-4 different people taking orders and checking , whom super friendly and efficient 
-granny smith apple seems hit or miss depending time year , but cinnamon honey butter tempers tartness apples quite nicely- ghirardelli chocolate little too sweet tastes , but good nonetheless- who wrong fried dough and powdered sugar ? 
discovered little loop hole : n't mind pushing brunch really n't problem means more time sleep ) , or : 30 
secretly and me... maybe.the ordered following- gumbo cups- crawfish beignets- shrimp & grits- egg & bacon tartine- oyster po'boyif ever party please learn mistake and not gluttonous eyes such excessive ordering food good but really heavy stuff think carbs , cheese and deep fry 
) here dinner waiting days n't serve dinner monday or tuesday ) 
ordered catfish des allemandes ? 
tasty & flavors worked well together 
probably n't never really liked grits , even orleans or atlanta 
here again , but probably lunch or dinner where more classic orleans dishes 
had beignets cafe du monde and light and fluffy 
next table eggs benedict and southern fried chicken and claimed best ever had... 've been orleans many times , even mardi gras , and never food.. good fried chicken & great biscuit w/jelly 
not sure intended but very little snap or crunch skin.i southern/cajun food just fried chicken , but unfortunately able judge place 
, excited place breakfast or brunch future 
other friends and different plates bfc and shrimp & grits ) and good 
random recommendation : combining shrimp & grits plate and chicken etouffee plate surprisingly really tasty 
honestly spot better elite cafe when creole style grub...but waiting place weekends sucks.must get...traditional beignets , shrimp and grits , and fried catfish or chicken eggs benedict 
also choice grits or potatoes 
tables & silverware little dirty , point where somewhat unappetizing , still deal 
crawfish beignets pretty good , little heavy cayenne pepper so outer shell tasted bit powdery & dry 
probably breakfast dishes next time and shrimp & grits.i also sweet watermelon iced tea , okay , note very pulpy 
only wish full bar , cocktails , or better micro beer selection 
pork belly & cheese gritz 
brenda started bfc chain leave kfc and popeye customers : bfc or bust 
unsure beignets order , fight : plain , chocolate , granny smith apple , & crawfish

, brenda figured how serve really delicious biscuits , fried chicken , grits , cheese and " soul " foods love , and deliver plate piping hot and presented beautifully.the beignets multiple flavors and taste beignet had paris or orleans 
architecture lovely and feel orleans ( or york ) 
choose house potatoes or grits and house potatoes delicious

pulled pork eggs benedict stars ( cross-section image yelp.com/biz_photos/ljag ( full plate image yelp.com/biz_photos/ljag ( cream biscuit w/ hash or grits sunday brunch special 
grits huge bowl , and n't hungry enough order famous shrimp & grits , but plain grits just really n't too impressive 
early or suffer wait 
shrimp & cheese grits n't normally such rich food , nor particularly cheese , but amazing 
lastly ... service bit bad , busy but glass water or order something them.... grabbing hard ... almost catch fast swimming fish point ordered coffees and bloody mary drink but waitress back coffee

generous portion oyster scramble so taste it....which great or bad thing 
granny smith apple , cinnamon honey butter oleast favorite...it tasted dry.shrimp & grits wow never savory beighnet 
best cajun southern food had.andouille sausage & cheddar omelette ( $ 10 mushrooms , scallions , sauce piquant- sausage well flavored eggs , mushrooms , great combination- bite enjoyable first- definitely recommendcatfish benedict- friend favorite dishes- instead english muffin served brenda famous buttery biscuits- biscuits bit too dry me- catfish well-fried ; crispy outside and flaky fish inside- enjoyed but prefer andouille sausage omelette morecrawfish beignets ( $ spiced cayenne , scallions & cheddar- order beignets- definitely best creation brenda ever- good amount crawfish flavored cayenne- bite delicious but beignet half meal so bigbeignet flight ( $ 9.50 ( filled molten ghirardelli chocolate , ( granny smith apple , ( crawfish- good indecisive- chocolate little too much and too sweet- granny apple ok- overall decent but best beignet crawfish oneservice : times been here gotten to-go lines quite long

bite and turned and told better order or regret 
here yesterday boyfriend first time & impressed 
love decor & most importantly food 
& boyfriend throught bit too pulpy when refill 
loaded flavor & honestly favorite 
rest good , nothing complain felt too much chocolate chocolate beignet.got bfc main entiree & boyfriend french toast 
chicken breast most flavorful & juiciest piece chicken breast ever 
& overall seasoning & crisp chicken delicious 
fries alright & biscuit big enough cut half & still fat biscuits lol 
shrimp not too soggy or soft deep fry and breading maintains integrity , so , when bite 
opted lunch instead breakfast , but definitely trip back breakfast or brunch feeling patient 
$ 20 head coffee omelette- eggs or french toast great portion size , extremely well cooked benedict : wait extremely long waiting hour n't earlytip : name advance and return back hour 
really wanted red beans & rice , and hush puppies....but too early 
-shrimp & grits....smothered melted cheese and filled generous portion tail-on shrimps.....this favorite dish but very very heavy and filling , so just caution ...it pairs super well homemade biscuits 
still try red beans & rice 
eggs benedict had perfectly poached eggs , but biscuit underneath almost hard and crunchy bottom , so only top , or whatever soaked soft yolk 
n't combo molasses flavor eggs and biscuit though.service good very attentive , but host rather irritated or impatient 
name called and moved and stepped front and " here " , and then n't hear or notice and so called other group and clear 
expected wait hour or so reviews read , but surprisingly waited less then minutes seated 
food philosophy : anything menu improved making portions larger and adding cheese or butter pecan sauce 
very busy restaurant , so go hours --- , lunch 11 : 00am , or : 30pm 
hahai always shrimp & grits biscuit 
popular spot prepared wait there opens or off-time 
try early or late , line 
eggs benedict come side hash or grits ; chose hash , unfortunately , very bland and needed hot sauce.finally , brenda homemade sweet watermelon tea completed meal 
type person n't or drink coffee certain point morning/afternoon , extremely cranky 
delicious beignets satisfy craving beignets not quite great cafe du monde orleans ) 
brunch specials what likely choose brunch or breakfast... but try normal menu first and... share , food too good not try everything 
definitely helps quenches thirst item specials recently dungeness crab croque w/fries & pickled watermelon 
beef cutlets braised spicy creole gravy , grits , eggs style , and choice cream biscuit or toast chose biscuit 
avoid rush there early morning or hour closing 
never thought grits , but " shrimp & grits " amazingly yummy 
n't feel lot options.my only complaint not able split bill between , or ways n't restaurant 
south so n't collards or mac n cheese best had , but decent 
watermelon mimosa or maybe passionfruit way great.i recommend crawfish doughnut start 
pancakes or shrimp and grits amazing breakfast 
good cafe du monde nola , but never been , n't even 
staff little forgetful or disconnected annoying but not unbearable 
last day sf , wanted something n't back sd or 
friends shrimp & grits and amazing 
or perhaps , fortunately ? 
ok. con list way...for bigger group place or not worth 
probably only place wait line sf , beignets not " du monde " authentic , but alone own right esp spicy crawfish 
gumbo really what , and , libby jane cafe next door , or sometimes seated brenda 
really enjoyed beans & rice--oh nice 
try place decided try brenda based great reviews friends and social networking sites & blogs and good word not me.waited 30 mins table , pretty fast group friends and chance menu and what other customers ordered- everything looked 
felt table either benedict or grits.. 
chocolate beignetscornmealfried shrimp oyster or catfish po boyegg and baco 
amazing , especially shrimp & grits and beignets 
ordered shrimp & grits main menu , good but not earth-shattering 
crawfish beignets bit heavy or maybe n't compare beignets orleans but flavor great 
shrimp grits very rich , wish more andouille or something cut richness but shrimp cooked perfection 
ranged light & fluffy ( plain super dense & heavy ( crawfish 
good stuff shrimp & goat cheese omelet eggs cooked nice and fluffy 
very substantial dish and virtually impossible finish sitting , especially flight beignets , grits and biscuits watermelon iced washed cool & refreshing concoction recommended server 
molasses glazed pork chop sweet potato hash , cheese eggs , and wheat toast or biscuit 
n't indulged enough ( or , rather , decided ) , ended meal beignets : granny smith apple and other chocolate 
shrimp & goat cheese omelette great 
still not sure godsend heavenly creation , or devil efforts tempt commitment deadly sins meal lust , gluttony , greed and sloth , cleverly disguised chocolate , apple , crawfish and plain 
and jamwith drowned made tenderly smashing freshly-picked organicstrawberries loving hands morning or carefully selected store-bought jar , not and care not tasted hopelessly delectable and most luscious pairing ever grace plate breakfasts

favorite item brunch , also vouch egg benedict , served creole hollandaise and grits or hash well shrimp and goat cheese omelette 
other filled beniegts well but plain where even range cafe du monde 
go house specialties or beniegts and goodness sake pick grits side 
only ever been here brunch , but definitely back here heavier dinner dishes such crawfish etouffee or fried chicken 
usual suspects beignets , shrimp & grits , boys 
nit sure supposed fudge or something 
dad asked missing sugar and mom n't n't anything town about.overall great but sure less busy time or 
order or pieces 
n't too crowded or anything 
grits or hash , and potatoes , n't great 
weekend , brunch & dinner 
back brunch or dinner 
second note , try party or less most tables meant 
hangtown fry oyster , bacon & scallion scramble ) hash and biscuit 
lord cousin local sf or else probably never found soul food gem own.brenda amazing local or tourist 
( love how scribble name & party chalkboard amazing 
& how resist biscuit breakfast , yum 
cousin shrimp & grits heavenly too 
friendly & n't pain ass 
brenda next time head sf.please favor & try place 
come right when opens or endure crazy line 
really good , but actually lack flavor , or simply salt.2 
friends or lover and share delicacies 
, backup plan ( always backup , even saltine crackers been crushed sitting ) pocket : order go.crawfish beignets , cheese grits , cream biscuits , hash , hangtown fry ( crispy oyster , bacon , scallion scramble ) , egg & bacon tartine...this order way napa 
wait and assist menu or suggestion rudely " back and left 
" short while later comes waitress wanting orders -- had repeat dishes wanted.service sorely lacking night one back check us.red beans & rice--oh nice 
other orders catfish des allemands 
talk other tables say " enjoying food or something similar ? 
, or hours burn line weekend morning , try brunch brenda 
_____ " .i 've been fooled long lines hipster brunches and trendy and mysterious way knowingly whisper such and such hole wall only opens prime number month lunar calendar : 29 : 31 and requires interpretive dance and everyone seated yurts and only pay dinars or czech korunas 
there tito jackson or making awesome name ? 
n't care place trendiest name or weirdest menu or only accessible diagon alley or literally covered , floor ceiling fixtures , cronuts 
walk back , realized brunch , and knew where next day.as limit sugar intake right now , not special french toast bananas foster ) or beignets 
n't wrong , bacon & egg tartine good , but exactly what and nothing 
wonder cost $ 2.75 each-shrimp & grits : grits well biscuit : p-bfc : fried chicken n't had but good enough 
major positive things point brenda breakfast ( or " brunch " , even : sure side order excellent beignets ; community coffee chicory pairs well , too ; and last , but definitely not leastest , sure try homemade jams ~ today choices strawberry and peach.i had strawberry jam past and already knew very good ( and not usually strawberry fan 
today , luck comment dites-vous " serendipity " en franais ? 
and other friends ordered and , still never opinion grits or ever recall what 
hours or early lines crazy.i had best shrimp and grits ever had 
closely placed tables transformed parties , bar seating , not best spot large party , but what expect real estate sf.i highly recommend spot brekkie or brunch 
enjoyed , reading reviews people dislike or love 
n't particularly keen chocolate or plain beignet , apple beignet pretty tasty ( better apple pie , perhaps and crawfish beignet 
beignets amazing and usually peanutbutter icebox pie or cobbler special 
makes wonder perhaps brenda gotten so confident customer base , letting go... or just off-day 
seen pretty high reviews place , so here guess... never cajun/creole/soul/southern food or rarely , probably brenda 
but when thought know quite few friends who food sits while.so hey , food not hot absolutely love brenda 's.another hint grits potatoes , not hot already covered , but also not crispy or spiced anything , just cool , soggy potatoes 
choose grits or hash side , and toast or biscuit 
30 or 40 min wait but worth 
ordered : beignet flight : chocolate , molten ghirardelli chocolate granny smith apple , cinnamon honey butter crawfish , cayenne , scallions & cheddar , traditional florentine egg benedict cream biscuits creole hollandaise , and grits.- hangtown fry consisted crispy oyster , bacon , scallion , scramble hash , and biscuit.i am very pleased meal wait ridiculously long time ordered food not feeling hungry 
sweet potato pancakes or pulled pork poboys 
once anyone inquire or offer questions menu selections 
actually grilliades beef pounded thin , lightly floured , sauteed then added sauce , more swiss steak or pot roast 
grits lacked many things , item note " grits " , way past runny and again little taste or texture quality cooked grits 
eggs cooked perfectly case , much talked biscuits dry and crumbled instantly touch and not buttered or jellied as good biscuit able 
red beans and rice or fried chicken 
time fried chicken & course best 
hubby ribs & mac-n-cheese yumo 
sister ghirardelli chocolate bread pudding & loved 
not same caf du monde 
compare cafe du monde but not fly orleans time craving 
food stars...three years and better ever...the nola-style recipes continue rock big flavor and generous portions ambiance 4.5 stars...they moved laundromat next door , so there more room , but still kind squeeze here...come 8am sundays or expect wait service 4.5 stars...attentive , responsive and friendly just down-home cajuns total stars...50,000,000 elvis fans still n't wrong 
understand not accustomed eating soul food , french soul food , or creole food probably impressed , but n't mommas 
nice place once while friends or date , but not place frequent morning 
main dish , ordered shrimp & grits and holy cow portions huge 
ordered egg & bacon tartine coffee friends got egg omelette

shudder , food top knotch , ambience lovely w mirror wall , high ceilings , and apt music , and service efficient and friendly , so again dinner or off time.take note : sunday brunch very , very time 
space high chairs , car seats or strollers 
what : chicken , sausage , and okra gumboi never gumbo or knew what so n't idea what expect but good and friend thought so well.- croque monsieurthe sourdough bread absolutely amazing and really compliments flavors baked ham and gruyere

shrimp & grits 
n't what possessed or who body time ordered , but and amazing 
tad dramatic but so worth : shrimp & grits 
shrimp & goat cheese omelet , shrimp & grits , and pulled pork benedict special found weekend brunch menu favorites order.also , normally dislike soju-made cocktails , but bloody mary really good due pickled okra garnish and cajun spice mix rim 
palate formed caribbean different flavors trinidad and tobago ; food flavorful.on visits brenda had chicken sausage & okra gumbo , b.f.c. , b.b.q 
food pretty decent , just nothing wow or certainly waiting more 30 minutes 
mmm right now delicious , satisfying & filling food 
time got 3rd list table and start chugging tea outside food or drinks allowed inside throw away walk door .we got " crawfish beignets " , " hangtown fry " and " housemade granola pancakes " 
, lightly-crispy outside , soft inside and oozing yummy cheddar & crawfish ( not fishy weirdos who n't fish ) 
hangtown fry : share but not huge oysters or bacon really n't thing 
worth hangtown fry...not sure full beignets or guava mimosa [ special menu and yum 
sure whole party or else wont seated definitely back 
crawfish beignet , shrimp & grits and chocolate beignet and everything delicious 
recommend shrimp & goat cheese omelette 
turns commentary homeless or provokes hate mail how insensitive , back brenda 's.brenda french soul food and orleans 
pancake special peaches or 
also kind rush and table seated given how crazy wait be.bottom line : food here decent , but not sure worth hype or wait 
fried catfish benedict only serve benedict brunch sundays or weekends , not so sure but something context 
random monday or something 2pm and small line door 
first trip , back brenda again second time , time order and try dishes last.between friend and , granny smith apple beignets , andouille sausage & cheddar omelette , and biscuits w/gravy 
worth wait , service not necessarily super friendly but very attentive ( makes sense basically not gunna get friendliest get so busy , but never worry not things refilled or waiting too long food , and everything order here enters mouth just 
ordered shrimp & grits peanut butter pie 
gentlemen , leave belts home & ladies , wear eating dress

shrimp & grits good 
grillades & grits and friend catfish eggs benedict -- incredibly delectible 
addicted andouille & cheddar omelette.next step excuse bring friends 
always shrimp & grits , cheesy amazing goodness 
group , shared order crawfish beignets ( $ ) , and then ordered following : bfc ( plus couple extra pieces chicken ) , chicken etoufee , grillades & grits , and hangtown fry 
bookmarks notes places future visits or reviews 
not sure bigger space or there early monday , but able stroll right in.i ordered beignet sampler normally comprised beignet varieties plan , apple , chocolate , and crawfish ) and side potatoes 
either not making correctly or just n't taste 
yikes note : plan metered parking driving day or else public transit and expect long wait rave 
potatoes little flavoring or spices 
fried chickens overly oily , indicative frier temperature set too low or other frier mismanagement 
ordered gumbo , beans & rice , jambalaya , and beignets 
n't finish ribs , collard greens or yams tasted too much cloves or allspice 
chicken sausage & okra gumbo and watermelon iced 
polk street address recommendation anyone living or visiting francisco 
dont know why maybe food or maybe good service or maybe classic style or maybe 
heavy food special occasion or once and awhile , but when , 
n't way here or deal long wait 
someday try lunch or brunch : regret not ordering watermelon tea only hear great things 
place n't etouffee , fried crab platters , 'gator , or boudin , modern french soul food brunch-fusion delicious and successful 
feel awful giving brenda measly star " a-ok " raving fanatics there...friend and shared croque monssieur and pulled pork sandwich came fries & course beignet sampler 
really mees grilled ham & cheese then top more bubbly delicious cheese 
pulled pork great flavor but just so much , crazy lady complaining tooooo much food eating really difficult & quite sloppy mess 
maybe ; m too princess-y , but certain degree " meant-to-be messy foods " where comfortable or uncomfortable eat.fries great 
sure cant mess lightly swet fried doughballs , dusted powdered sugar , then left plain or filled chocolatey goodness 
maybe just not fan crawfish or distinct fishy flavor 
just wasnt and cents & own 
n't lot time , so n't decide bfc , housemade sweet potato dumplings , catfish po'boy , crawfish beignets , hushpuppies or baked en croute salad 
seated , table delicious beignet , never , n't sure beignet or hushpuppies 
n't ever or ever wait 1/2 hours food ever again 
light cafe du monde ones orleans 
here 2nd time , and usual , long wait hour or so 
good thing n't wait line place or been disappointed 
never beignets good cafe du monde orleans ( and but beignets here creative and fun share 
proceeded wait hour or so and 2.5 hours , finally seated 
faced making split second-choice decision , and little dismayed none other signature items appealed crawfish beignets sound gross someone who n't seafood ended common breakfast items -- ham & cheese egg white omelette 
usually leave 20 % or more 
restaurant pretty nice inside but area surrounding somewhat sketchy careful walking or taking public transportation 
time mix dough , butter , and fry delicious flavor or add-in , thing great 
soon brought , knew pretty much only fried chicken or never finish 
libby jane coffee shop door helps bit wait duck coffee or something munch = ] love brenda 
ever area , or even not , definitely brenda try 
completely unacceptable host require such item disposed or left floor.it takes special level arrogance customer try and rip $ 2.00 coffee when average bill $ 80... and attitude full display.unfortunately , specifically reason no longer recommend restaurant 
n't attempt restaurant weekend brunch hours 10 and 1pm party larger or expect wait pretty long time 
mac n cheese satisfied craving but doesnt beat 90210 or south recipe 
: very high room improvement and fried pickles or okra ; place so awesome flaw easily fixed 
, menu sounded delicious and enticing , but finally agreed crawfish beignet and shrimp & grits 
shrimp & grits pretty delicious , but still quite heavy brunch food 
early weekend or plan waiting 
insanely delicious.you literally not wrong here , brunch , lunch , or dinner.everything amazing.beignets sweet or savory ? 
beans & rice ? 
great early or weekday 
love/ hate then high expectations and either satisfies or disappoints 
big and lively and great atmosphere brunch group friends or head workout 
recommend here or am not wait hr seating 
beignet du jour , crab filled beignet 
perfectly poached eggs , sturdy yet soft biscuit held nicely leftovers , and green onion fried potatoes = stick ribs kinda meal.the bf crispy pork belly & grits too heavy , but loved 
sweetness sauce mild enough consume taste buds but not overwhelm or drench toast 
favorites & generally popular dishes , crawfish beignets and shrimp&grits also available dinner menu 
, beignets incredible , but stick chocolate or apple 
time definitely breakfast or brunch and beignets sure 
fried chicken & catfish ) , but enjoyed sides more anything 
( n't offended waiter or waitress and n't menu and ingredients memorized..i 'm just notice extra effort and give extra tip 
choose potatoes or grits sides 
dennys or 
worth it....to try once or twice...or times...maybe four.....and fifth time...just order takeout 
food savory , portions big , and big or home 
order delicious , but : bfc , gumbo , shrimp & grits , and beignets 
absolutely back line , or even small line , food just good 
favorites brunch catfish benedict and shrimp & grits 
lunch favorites catfish or shrimp po boys.i 'm not really fan watermelon iced tea n't stuff drinks and n't watermelon really 
order tea or something else 
weekends , get 10 and weekdays lunch get 11 : 30 or earlier.brenda definitely fat 
skeptical place when first due franciscans raving place or place best fried chicken , leading review good fried chicken anyone city 
bay or just visiting and n't been brenda high time priorities together.everything deelish 
main course ordered bfc or pieces fried chicken fries 
--we never served or offered cream or sugar coffee--i asked bacon listed omelette served side 
omg , shrimp & grits , crawfish beignets and watermelon tea 
ordered oyster sandwich specials , but also order cornmeal-fried shrimp po'boy , sloppy josephine , grillades & grits , and crawfish beignets 
place small and wouldnt recommend bringing big group or kids 
uber-crowded time coffee , but never felt rushed finish or leave table ( anyway good manners 
dining here restaurant not big deal or must-dine ambiance , but great to-go food 
crawfish beignet hands down favorite.the next time brenda shrimp & grits mix sides.glad walked mile there and back hotel : heavy and delicious 
almost always when here though... favorite shrimp & grits sauted shrimp , cheddar grits , spicy tomato-bacon gravy 
bit heavy long drive , but something irresistible cheesy grits smothered salty gravy... ( mouth watering now .i mistake wanting try something new and ordered grillades & grits ( beef cutlets braised spicy creole gravy , served grits , eggs style , plus cream biscuit or toast 
expected beefy version shrimp & grits -- dice.of course , n't wrong classic oldies , but goodies eggs benedict , french toast lotta toast person 
) , or homemade granola pancakes fruit huuuuge 
service hit-or-miss ( usually servers here too busy smile or complete sentence hurry again 
talk service.will recommend place everyone , walk or uber , parking stretch , but so worth back 
total food envy.- jambalaya & side salad w/ vinaigrette dressing $ 10 yelp.com/biz_photos/ljag ) : bit disappointed 
currently live brooklyn , homeless ( or extremely disenfranchised people more accurate ) pretty much part landscape 
so moist butter or jam 
more sugar , lower quality.did mention , francisco soul food experience albeit french ) , only identifiable black person currently eating black couple waiting and guy who or not identify black ; n't sure ) ? 
somewhat expert own mind accented pronunciation different languages , fluent or not 
foodwise , i grillades & grits and good i opt shrimp and grits time , just tastier overall.the environment felt very different and visiting city 
sat counter bar -- or seats -- thought first come , but actually turned part overall hostess seating scheme ... oops ... well probably only cut front other top ... and seats right door ( way very few people sense close way or ) so cramped and cold ( so other top actually taking seats ) .we ordered plain beignets -- huge ( too big ) but delicious 
more groups ahead but seated 10 minutes or so 
, suppose hit or miss depending doughnuts 
butter grits , just good form.come early or later , try gauge dining rush 
love foods suppose sweet or savory , but end other way 
" " menu 3p or 3.30p 5p or 5.30p first disappointed beignet not menu , but when asked serve beignet whole day 
food consistent & always delicious , not quite sure worth few hours waiting 
plan waiting walk liquor store and grab bottle or champagne kill time 
roommate lives grits , everything had been amazing but most memorable shrimp sando & simple damn watermelon drink 
actually been here several times now so surprised n't written review place yet.really depends what soul food and or not..lol

shrimp & grits next order next time here 
lived closer city regulars time.located polk turk & eddy 
time left ~ 11 : 30am or noon...there dozen people waiting...crazy popular 
menu simple and dishes server recommended- shrimp & grits , bfc ( w/ mac and cheese and huge biscuit , crawfish beignets , gumbo and finished dinner ghirardelli chocolate beignets 
thick and juicy ground beef patty cooked medium , remoulade sauce , perfectly toasted buttered bun , caramelized onion , and choice gruyere $ 1.00 , egg $ 2.00 or , hungry , 
, everyone heard burgers nopa , marlowe , spruce , or bar tartine ( sadly longer offer ... but assure brenda kick-ass burger joke -- kicks other burgers ass 
thoughts : n't wrong choice buttery , rich cheese grits or potato " hash , " cooked scallions , not onions , and filling but not greasy.her french toast tasted great thanks butter pecan syrup top toasted brioche 
dough cooked very well and not overly greasy.the gumbo ( chicken , sausage , okra , rice ) really mediocre...i added tapatia sauce flavor.biscuits warm , fluffy , & huge ( only managed half ) 
love grits , and southern style cooking mother & grandparents south , so southern food comfort food 
place spacious & airy tall ceilings 
love wall art & mirrors , and big fans hovering remind really hot summer days south 
: great place & visited appetizers evening and breakfast 
eaten least 15 times , and grits , biscuits , flight beignets , peach cobbler pancakes , crawfish po boy , or water melon iced tea , brenda never failed 
not worth hype or n't as good as expected , clearly lost sight end day brenda just breakfast/brunch grub and dinner sometimes too 
grillades & grits really tasty , little bit everything : beef cutlet , gravy , grits , eggs , and biscuit , try 
shrimp plump & juicy just right amount coleslaw break taste 
crispy & full flavor 
memories college parties , frolicking sand , winning lottery , unicorns & double rainbows engulfed medulla oblongata 
had many share regular eggs benedict and ones always runny , insecure , loose & drippy 
dish n't live ~ $ 11 or so many not tried shrimp po boy ~ 10 , had fair share and hers disappoint , but same time very similar everyone else 
food coma or tryptophan , whatever gave me.. good feeling 
shrimp po'boy , crawfish beignets , fried chicken , and shrimp & grits haves 
shrimp & goat cheese omelette , boyfriend eggs benedict 
basically hush puppy filled cheese , chives , and seasoned crawfish cayenne pepper sprinkle top , or stuffed chocolate , apple cinnamon , or whatever menu and sprinkled powdered sugar 
sure exercise day or visiting 
here monday or tuesday breakfast/lunch friend and and sat wait 
gumbo good , nothing adventurous or unique , porch mission , but more traditional gumbo and very tasty.the real standout , crawfish beignet 
definitely back , but tough someone weekday afternoon and bf adverse driving wait hour brunch , especially only pricey metered parking where quarter min or something , fear not able back handle long wait situation weekends 
figured there 'd no wait or short most 
beignets fresh and pipping hot , good west coast but cafe du monde.-shirmp and grits oh yummy and huge portion well 
11 : 30 and already kind wait , so n't imagine what 12 or 12 : 15 
prowl delicious brunch spot sunday morning , boyfriend and decided head brenda whirl 2500 reviews & stars definitely enticing prospect 
meal , ended shrimp & grits and boyfriend opted catfish eggs benedict 
food good , not overwhelmingly so and left wishing ordered eggs benedict , too.favorite parts whole meal : beignets & watermelon iced tea 
always normally shrimp po'boy or pulled pork 
cheesy , shrimpy , and world delicious , so sure or someone table orders this.other notable dishes include gillades and grits , oyster poboy , and course famous crawfish beignets , but shrimp and grits where brenda when visiting sf and everyone 've eaten list 
and friend also ordered shrimp & grits and egg and bacon tartine 
shrimp and grits okay , loved tomato , bacon , and shrimp , but n't spectacular or particularly great 
really n't wrong ordering anything here but favorite grillades & grits 
staff awesome or slow , but usually very busy totally understandable 
way , friend arrived probably waited 30-40 mins or so 
got feel fancy l.a cringe making comparison nor-cal does n't so-cal ) hotel restaurant but snootiness or ridiculous prices 
whew raving yelp reviews , order beignet flight , shrimp & grits and watermelon iced tea 
absolutely loved shrimp & grits , served very generous portion 
husband enjoyed egg & bacon tartine ( bacon , egg , gruyere and tomato relish french roll 
shrimp & grits , amazing 
crawfish beignets awesome and catfish des allemandes definitely worth $ 17 
beignets awesome , feel needed creamy sauce or something dip , but still yummy just powdered sugar top. 
choice grits or hash side , glad ordered hash.. delicious shrimp&grits surprisingly amazing 
well worth staff , service & ah-amazingly super yummy food , definitely back again.. and. 
n't rocket science , but barely anyone knew where write name or what meant including 
good small group dishes or gluttons and friend who ordered enough people 
room left beignets especially classic yellow cafe du monde tins tables.. ) 
downside long wait friend & here tuesday , right noon and line 
omelette fried oysters & green onion amazing 
tldr ; not good mama , sweet maple , or dottie 's.i here weekday morning girlfriend , worried weekend line too long

great biscuits & try new orleans beer 
crayfish beignet large , spicy , & good amount crayfish bits stuffed 
hush puppies , however , almost big beignets & not deep fried

ambiance here nice , great casual meal or fancy dinner 
, just favorite discovered porch mac & cheese 
only 5-7 minute wait and great seat sun light.i oj and friend yummy coffee drink been capaccino or machiato- n't not coffee drinker

dinner : crawfish beignet : huge beignet , real fluffy , tasty crawfish filling , great touch cayenne pepperfried chicken : order la carte , piece $ 4-5 , excellent breading , perfectly fried , not kfc chickenmac & cheese : baked cup goat cheese , cheddar cheese 
cheesy and goat cheese amazingly good.sausage & chicken gumbo : sausage and chicken very tender , okra n't gumbo too slimy , but still somewhat slimy.cornmeal shrimp po'boy : good shrimp , but sauce top very overwhelming , ask sauce side prefer.watermelon tea excellent here and free refills

arrived or 10min past and ended seated : 30 
, grab cup coffee brenda or venture philz cafe block or away.note : expanding restaurant 
pretty much amazing start finish , breakfast , brunch , lunch or dinner 
option or platter 
starters : -crawfish beignet ( heavenly , fluffy dough , hot savory deliciousness inside ) -garlic shrimp gratin ( shrimps good , but not focal point , piquillo pepper & goat cheese fondue finger lickin delicious toast ) cup chicken , sausage & okra gumbo ( very good , not amazing eric fat alley ) entrees : -cornmeal-fried oyster po'boy ( huge portion 
very flavorful , coleslaw side just right -catfish des allemands ( crawfish ouff good , pilaf great choice , catfish used pinch salt , but large tender flakes piece bfc ( perfectly fried beautifully crisp skin , juicy meat dessert ( yes , pushed more -beignet flight ( best hot plain , best room temp chocolate 
expect walk there parking or bart somewhat uncomfortable 
, local then um yea , bring book or something.i more love idea french soul food rather actual taste 
been wanting here forever or least heard words " crawfish beignets 
pumpkin pancakes good , but only or bites sweet and way too thick 
pining grits been , persuaded shrimp & grits waaaay too much cheese liking , so just stuck plain order gritty goodness 
also sports line match , but line n't door or reasonably short diners fast 
place super tiny and wait hours so trick shopping or walk city hall instead waiting front everyone else.. however , miss call then assed 
great flavors yet light , fluffy outside.also love chocolate beignet , n't need apple or plain one.i 've also fried shrimp po'boy chipotle aioli and gumbo incredible 
sure not lose $ extra pot tea or two...my only other complaint temp 
dishes gotten and again , and never gotten over.for few appetite bigger mine , beignets french fritters great starter or side

dishes way too rich , crawfish beignet soaked oil and grease , and shrimp & grits bathing sea cheese 
waiting almost 90 minutes , definitely delirious and expecting food absolutely blow away.we started beignet flight very hit or miss 
dough little too heavy and nowhere fresh and delectable what cafe du monde

omelet time , specifically shrimp and goat cheese omelet carmelized onions biscuit and choice hash or grits potatoes 
remembering full easily place , so next time stick guns and just order beignets or none 
best weekdays , or- good planner- hour or hungry.ambiance : cozy , hipstery vintage decor , squeaky clean bottles louisiana hot sauce and homemade jam perched side side

oyster sampler fantastic.fried chicken solid , but prefer chicken porch or 1300.most , staff really cool 
paying customers who way or elsewhere 
only complaint everything super super rich tasting , sides or garnishes plates balance richness 
little bit fresh fruit or sort creative pairing done restaurant been excellent

honestly not possible bad meal here , but menu highlights personally crawfish-stuffed beignets , sausage & okra gumbo , shrimp & grits , and coffee chicory 
potato hash more mushy blob unloved potatoes expecting something more formed hash patty or cubed potatoes seasoned... bit lacking ) but portions here ample and service par 
: flight beignets or really just order crawfish beignets.. 
wait place weekend just ridiculous and n't patience wait hours food , matter how good is.we beignets sampler , hanger fry , and grillades & grits 
wrong anything fried , covered melted cheese or sprinkled bacon ? 
understaffed...do not come here expecting drink refilled or waiter ask how things

absolutely delicious food.must haves : beignets , shrimp and gritsterribly long line and wait times hour or more n't early 
not drink ice tea , watermelon or regular got ta most wanky tea city , not sure stale ice , poor water or awful tea.this joint nothing resembling good ole southern comfort , so brendas favor and run run far far away 
lot grease or salt ; just flavor 
n't wrong , n't swoon or anything , but great flavor and texture 
good selection sweet or savory dishes , mostly latter , soul food restaurant 
totally unnecessary food f & $ filling 
n't already full beignets or starters , biscuit alone 
worth wait or very least , planning avoid same wait 
still best versions had anywhere including charleston , savannah , or orleans ) 
! , depending what order , bill cheap or moderate , entirely 
hangtown fry everything but little too cramped en croute salad and watermelon iced tea awesome 
shrimp & grits best ever 
last visit expand location , ideal , but additional space 45 minutes rain or shine , just seat 
never leave disappointed , just bundle , bring umbrella case pour and enjoy best places breakfast and or brunch city 
ordered chocolate beignet start pretty good.my husband ordered grillades & grits -- grits tasteless and beef cutlets dry 
not once mediocre or ok thing here times shivering and drooling cold waiting seat , people often stroll curiously menu 
n't waste $ or there again bit torn way review 
ok exaggeration or not , definite server super full life and attentive too 
) gulf shrimp boy w/ french fries [ $ 9.50 ] : thought similar animal burger in-n-out ( tomatoes , lettuce , & thousand island ) harder 
tasted pretty good , but initially disappointed served ordinary looking water glass head , imagining pretty champagne flute or something 
soon realized glass ties well honest & casual feel place 
first bite mind-blowing.service also very quick.but insist serve mac & cheese lunch and not only dinner 
( little hesitant now everyone stay and wait , making longer wait ha ha , waited hour and half , but lucky enough wait inside ( away cold & rain 
: main library and city just street , so really , inside library and browse books , or case city , gawk awesome ceiling main lobby 
: tenderloin , sketchy characters money or cigarettes , but brenda n't open night and usually lot people waiting seated , really not scary all.will back more 
far tried apple honey butter beignets , shrimp & cheese grits , beans & rice , catfish and chicken 
welcome stephanie or samantha whatever name ) 
breakfast , lunch , or dinner , n't matter 
love orleans and close quarter or garden district

watermelon iced tea , breakfast , lunch , or dinner 
brunch or dinner , favorite places city and not surprised so many other great reviews 
great thing brenda brunch unique , southern twist , so not just re-hashing eggs benedict oh what , slight spin hollandaise sauce , or yet omelette conglomeration ingredients includes form cheese , veggie ,and protein.instead , things sweet potato pancakes butter pecan sauce , crawfish beignets damn freakin amazing ) , pork belly cheesy grits and eggs , and other such brunch foods unique southern twist and flavor.as review here confirmed , n't wrong beignets 
pork belly special and sweet potato pancakes here possible ) , and stomach even thighs , butt , or belly later ) .this place easily list places revisit , and line slightly shorter other places city 
glad , worth wait ; ordered crawfish beignet crawfish , cayenne , scallions and cheddar plus shrimp & cheesy grits 
covered oil or butter , and love clogging arteries lard 
chinese donuts or trish donuts 
luckily , n't wait long , or been disappointed 
burger delicious and wife loved cornmeal-fried shrimp,oyster or catfish po'boy and crawfish beignets 
n't agree more sure 11 : 30a.. n't 11 : 45 or line everyone else 
sitting space crammed happy patrons.service & cost expect open wallet , place n't cheap , but affordable 
good packed house or just few long food rocks.the waitress couple times decide orders 
got eye just everything menu.a word advice : spot quickly something tells sooner or later , check : bay area review place and then good luck finding table 
n't wait back more.i bart francisco just , so even tickets expensive ~ $ 10 roundtrip , worth every penny.i ordered shrimp & grits , and friend ordered crawfish 
shrimp & grits super flavorful , bits tomatoes , bacon , and sausage ? ? 
dish also choice coleslaw or fries , but waitress nice enough half and half.there so many items menu , definitely back 
fact , coffee or mimosa waiting table , so time by pretty quick 
ordered : gumbo -- nice flavors big chunks chicken , sausage , and okra $ 7.25 beignets sampler donuts filled surprise ingredient $ 9.50 order likabiltiy : crawfish , cayenne , scallions & cheddar -- delicious

few bites shrimp & grits , and awesome , too 
and drooling everyone else food , vowed return next trip and order oyster po'boy or oyster anything 
occasion : brunch rich what had : chicken , sausage & okra gumbo ( $ 7.25 food review : had plenty creole gumbo louisiana , but first time what intended cajun gumbo 
combination creole and cajun styles soup lighter color and consistency meaning been cooked less time creole , but use poultry and lack seafood or tomatoes characteristic cajun gumbos 
plenty tables groups or , but addition wait , seating issue larger parties 
etouffee very good and or less what expected , n't what crawfish begniets , usually sweets fried donut 
advice , weekday lunch hour , but weekends , then arrive early or prepared hour wait.but wait oh worth 
dough beignets very tasty but fillings hit or miss 
shrimp & grits delicious -- crawfish beignets even 
and foremost brick wall and high glass celings perfect location breakfast , brunch or lunch 
but try lunch or dinner instead avoid waiting very pretty little restaurant efficient service and friendly staff.we coffee & chicory , chocolate beignets , and veggie omelets grits and toast and biscuits and hash.a plate beignets meal : not mini-donuts cafe monde , but rather size large filled croissants , and 
taste french soul food , indeed..nom noms.ordered shrimp & grits 
insert iphone heart emojis louisiana donuts fabulous , however full when & half. 
entree waiting , so proceeded wonderful shrimp & grits 
only ever been here breakfast , so n't comment lunch or dinner 
, not cheap , and n't many options people diet.my favorite egg and bacon tartine dish , love tomato-bacon relish.in opinion , gumbo chicken , sausage and okra much better cajun pacific version sunset , or angeline berkeley.but beef cutlets grillades and grits dish slightly tough.remember check daily specials written corner mirror wall.something seldom mentioned other reviews table condiments 
perfectly sweet , but not cloying or fake tasting 
never cheese grits or good 
seen or smelled here fantastic 
not sure post binge-drinking shakes , or fact ass front someone once liked , night , but away feeling cheated excellent brunch , and kind ruined whole saturday.moral story ? 
book , client engagement & interventions study class--thankfully long chapter 
public transportation here or cab 
sure when fresh and hot truly ultimate experience -hangtown fry : crispy oyster , bacon & scallion scramble , grits , and cream biscuit 
recommend ordering arrive meal or else ruin appetite 
food absolutely amazing and hour wait saturday or sunday brunch 
here early or waiting line 
n't decide what so ordered bunch sides : gritspecan sweat potato pancakesmac & cheese beignets chocolate mos back something else eye pull pork egg benedict ) quick friendly service and affordable prices 
grew soul food , specifically mom born and raised orleans and swear life either very day or food bad 
love watermelon iced tea drink gallons and andouille sausage and cheddar omelette or shrimp and grits 
busy brunch holiday , seated 30 mins or so 
giving brenda stars , grits favorite things world , and never better when here.a mound ground corn , cooked , and simmered hours patience and done right way lots love ; milk , butter , and few other magical ingredients grits.unfortunately , ever crunchy , watery , tasteless garbage microwave , or restaurant makes then probably already been scared , and n't understand first few paragraphs 
famous dishes such chicken , sausage & okra gumbo , cinnamon battered brioche french toast , and course , what hooked first place stuffed beignet flight.if ever enjoyed delicious fried ozzie roll great american restaurants such sweet water , or mike american imagine doubled size , and stuffed crawfish , scallions and cheddar 
: shrimp & grits , hush puppies , sweet potato dumplings , crawfish beignets , and fabulous waiter , matthew

just and hungry or hungover , so nitty gritty : must-try : beignets , shrimp & grits ( beware , heavy ) , biscuits&gravy , andouillemaybe : pancakes ( dont waste space ) line breakfast unfailingly long , but food unquestionably worth wait 
people max or evil looks 
guess great place tenderloin , but not sure compete places mission or upper polk street 
location interesting , wandering direction lead interesting street corners filled francisco finest ; aka tenderloin start or end beignet sampler crawfish delicious 
matter what else order , what time day , or how uncertain hunger level , order beignet flight 
good grits , broken record or porch.the catfish po-boy yawn 
dense or doughy imo 
coq monsieur disappointing , great picture , but cheese n't grilled well , and cheese n't gruyere cause n't smell or taste great.all , great place other interesting cuisine american cuisine 
finally back and beignet flight....i always shrimp and grits or shrimp omelette egg whites 
rest food , indifferent or detest 
sweet or savory ? 
and hungry or share 
not cafe du monde , but delicious own right 
" line " long , but least name list and wander or aside 
absolutely reservations recommending restaurant anyone meet.and n't even dessert.service was fast ( 5/5 ) ambience was great ( 4.5/5 ) trendy dinner friends or impressive ( but not pretentious ) first date 
bonus points putting own name chalkboard waiting list.food great ( 4.5/5 : cajun oyster & southern-style breaded oyster 5/5 shrimp po'boy 5/5 ( huge 
location probably seat 30 people or less 
n't decide apple , chocolate or crawfish best 
n't pate too gamey or fatty or strange , try.i 'm drinking wine , and wife drinking watermelon iced tea 
not expect so big , beignets hops & hominy more bite-sized 
n't finish , easily tomorrow breakfast or midnight snack... : gumbo delicious 
watermelon but almost too subtle taste and watermelon sweet tea , taste watermelon , right ? granola pancakes and other people liked , kinda not thing.. dried cranberries or and ton granola and syrup , overly sweet and sweet 
only street parking or nearby parking garages 
ordered : crawfish beignets , hushpuppies,shrimp & grits & cornmeal-fried shrimp po'boy 
beignets fantastic...and split " flight " order just or two...because huge 
wanted savor biscuits but n't had room beignets or else 
mention bill just 24.oo bucks beignet flight , coffee , cream biscuit , sausage gravy & fries 
crawfish beignet & chocolate beignet favorites 
, once food arrives too busy eating notice or care good.oh , and chocolate fan , or donut fan , get beignets 
beef cutlets , denny or , hungry frozen dinners 
n't overpower crabcake or blow palate 
or groups front , n't long seated.this wednesday ( sort brunch , restaurant still full 
tasted thousand island dressing red vingrette or something 
good flavors.we also shared shrimp & grits well andouille sausage and cheddar omelette 
shrimp & grits ridiculous 
dismay , cajun bloody mary or whatever called total disappointment 
much-see and must-eat , new bay or ever area.they amazing coffee well 
ohhh and only conundrum this... chocolate or crawfish beignets or ? ? 
soooo...hair food n't deserve free meal or drink here...fyi 
chicken , sausage & okra gumbo amazing too -- usually , gumbos had pretty packed w/ meat but pretty light , 
entrees , recommend shrimp & grits but only share w/ someone pretty damn cheesy ( but who n't love cheese ? 
okay...i lived or orleans years and reluctant and skeptical place 
hit nostalgia right entrance community and cafe du monde tins decorating space and " orleans water meter " clock wall 
person orders fried chicken eggs benedict , and other person orders pancake specials , or even french toast 
fried chicken eggs benedict & pecan syrup duo just favorite sf brunch 
absolutely loved dish... left plate clean , even flight beignets , bloody mary & mimosas 
crawfish beignets , mac & cheese , bfc , grillades & grits , croque monsieur , gumbo , and watermelon tea.the beignets great , fluffy goodness 
mac & cheese so creamy and delicious 
grillades & grits nice flavors only downside beef tad dry 
definitely that.i 'd only been breakfast & last week , couple favorite dinner partners world able meet special brenda dinner treat 
salad chicken & brie en croute extremely tasty , but dressing or accidental spill salt shaker , salt overwhelmed what been best salad world 
crawfish beignets first & helped set tone 
sampled hushpuppies & best ever real corn & green onion complimented centers 
love puppies.i also love collards & brenda everything right 
own & mean collards.chocolate & cherries match made heaven & mixed dessert bread pudding stuff dreams made 
just fill dim sum mid-afternoon lunch & gorged again early dinner.you 're refills watermelon ice tea & great alcohol selections , probably n't leave quick pee 
remodel very tasteful & nice longer walk kitchen restroom , but seriously 
smaller average & sideways shimmy tables 
little small and not big enough groups bigger people , but good pick brunch significant other or friend 
amazing food , literally bite filled delight and left " best meal ever " .the baked oysters crazy good , oysters finger licking good.mac & cheese mac & cheese 
finally boyfriend shrimp and grits really good and salad brie & catfish.... omg blissin and still feel food happiness today 
" , , line here pretty long , so long nite partying , consider wait penance bad boy or girl ...once , mimosas party or really refreshing watermelon lemonade start rehab tap.the food really good trust me , doctor actually , n't , but born and raised cajun country .the gumbo rocks 
planning here weekends , 8am or expect wait 
greatthe beignets greatit great soul food tlwhat good knowthey cafe monde coffee here , famous orleans , but not favorite...the portions little small many items , and not flavorful preferthe prices bit high portion , neighborhood and settingthe hype surrounding restaurant incredible , get reservation or early avoid long waits.. 
crab beignets , crawfish beignets , fried chicken eggs benedict , shrimp & grits , beef & grits... and plenty watermelon iced tea.it perfect ending perfect 2012 nye celebration.thanks brenda 
arrived : 30 saturday night , and waited hour or so stayed person who walked restaurant " rather delicious " and time door opened started salivate delicious smells 
time there , egg & bacon tartine , also pleasant burst happiness mouth 
wait long never been there late lunch or dinner , but there early enough , fine 
wait , human instinct wanted down so asked door waitress grab seat , " someone right " couple minutes asked just down " someone seat " , why wait place half empty and not big so , whatever , now.look menu looks good , ordered fried oysters eggs and other stuff and asked waitress , hashed browns or home frys , replied potatoes , repeated repeated , so hashed browns , yes or , yes.food came , n't hashed browns , not biggie but y so rude.eat food , bill came , wrong bill , so rigth bill.so place not so busy , yet attitude sky high , food good but guess what , plenty places good food sf so n't attitude breakfast 
not compare mimi triple layer coconut cake , dad famous cajun crab cakes and rice or hole-in-the-wall po-boy shop somewhere orleans...but place reminds gal home 
fried green tomato soggy and impossible cut fork or knife 
: ) good food , decent prices , average installations...had crayfish beignets similar large portuguese shrimp rissol but not good ) , fried chicken and bread pudding.the bread pudding only clearly average.would try shrimp & grits 
n't hangtown fry or other po boys , things brunch menu order dinner well.-crawfish beignets reintroduce ? 
stay or living city complete brenda 's.everything done here done right and done big 
just n't rely review , everyone else , or many people who wait 30-90 mins day just table tip : weekends , here early ( : 00 am or forced wait 45-90 mins table 
+ crawfish , cayenne , scallions & cheddar beignets 
server friendly and attentive needs.we ordered following : -mocha ( bit too sweet and not strong enough ) -flight beignets crawfish , chocolate , and apple ( absolutely loved crawfish and chocolate ) -hubs andouille sausage & cheddar omelette ( n't big fan sauce but everything else ) -i ordered and enjoyed french toast side bacon ( daughter and actually shared along beignets ) experience great 
probably fifth or sixth visit 
minutes , seated given : 30pm and competition 14 person party sitting , not figure what order...breakfast or lunch ? 
hot , melted cheese and chunks crawfish oozing , covered thick coating paprika or cayenne memory fails and studded green onions 
grits creamy and shrimp cooked perfection.if been orleans or lived , n't suggest beignets 
beignets too doughy and heavy not crispy and fluffy inside say cafe du monde 
specials posted board , so even , knew what wanted order : shrimp & grits 
thought little bite-sized pieces , but definitely full-size beignets- chocolate , apple , plain , and crayfish ( or crawfish ? 
addictive.so back shrimp & grits- rich , decadent dishes ever eaten 
pretty busy , right when opens or late lunch close 
soul food place or city comparable , but not brenda humble opinion 
n't more disgusting--that or pile feces 
recommend egg & bacon tartine , tasty combo served atop toasty french roll--it fancypants version breakfast sandwich but way 
" good thing n't , or swear left tip whatsover.i tend very upset experiences bad service , and shame 
hangtown fry , biscuits , shrimp & goat cheese omelette , beignets , and banana-walnut-praline pancakes waaay too good

food quickly , and never refill coffee or ice tea 
main breakfast or brunch entree 
thought rather naughty something n't care much beignet or doughnut familiar form and stuff carefully spiced crawfish concoction and turn something dream night.i really enjoyed fried catfish eggs benedict beautiful creole hollandaise sauce generously smothered biscuits soak creamy goodness 
( alternatively molasses ham , fried chicken , or florentine 
back and thought a. gon na not charge or 
sat back smiling and remarked how happy here instead.and then... shrimp & grits 
illegal substance taken away minute or something 
quick look menu intrigued , and even possibility hour wait n't detract...so headed polk street , ready join crowds people brunch place easter sunday.we wait hour , but flew , perused special menu and debated ones order...the crispy pork belly cheddar grits spicy relish , pulled pork eggs benedict hash , or catfish po-boy...the beignets not even question , and creole bloody mary mean smokra ? 
kitchen not skimp pulled pork , and hollandaise just enough kick cut fat meat truly delicious.we rolled brenda debating walk park or nap , and what next time 
only thing away stars here staff sat someone who drunk drugs or suffering acute narcolepsy 
watermelon ice tea , beignets , shrimp & grits 
mmmmm.yummy , cozy , comforting food & ambiance 
metered parking : $ 0.25 10 minutescrawfish beignet hotpocket : $ : 00hearty and flavorful chicken & sausage gumbo : $ 7.25getting soul food tenderloin : priceless place loses star staff not friendliest 
place extremely tiny , so early or risk wait long time 
place hit or miss 
gumbo , mac & cheese , and watermelon iced tea too very , very good 
done away potatoes or grits bc potatoes ehhh 
solid & consistent 
worth wait nor $ 12 or 14 charge 
back 1300 or even auntie april fried bird 
matter what time day order or 
neighborhood not much terms culinary options great , recommended friends city watch ballet or orpheum 
chocolate wonderful , but apple beignets hold deep fried key heart.the egg & bacon tartine phenomenal , juicy tomato relish and wonderfully light omelet 
shrimp & grits absolutely delicious 
very unique combination , but n't taste anything extraordinary it.i grillades & grits w/ biscuit 
sure enough , n't chicken or nachos people line , but brenda french soul food 
brenda watermelon ice tea so refreshing cup or two.. or whenever dine here 
sourdough bread and ham full or flavor and high quality 
party 3.we started watermelon ice teas , cafe lait & waters 
stood as delicious or even remotely close what grew eating or home 
very good meal lunch , or dinner , and great place brunch 
chock full ingredients chocolate or apple cinnamon spice , or great plain 
big fan dottie , but when something little unique or southern inspired definitely brendas 
apple tasted apple pie but donut form , and chocolate & crawfish ones 
served side fries or cole slaw but who when sandwich main attraction 
n't much this.shrimp & gritsi n't recall ever grits but ones served here way buttery 
recommend beignets , grillades & grits and po'boys 
never big fan oysters only portions.shrimp & grits 9this dish order next time 
someone sensitive motion sickness bring dark cloth cover table , wear dark sunglasses , or dramamine 
been eying while and finally meet everything else closed or super slow years day , brenda hour wait 
ordered beignets shrimp & grits shrimp po boy 
honestly n't know.shrimp & grits : highly recommend 
beignets delicious really chocolate and crawfish cayenne , scallions & cheddar beignets 
mere 30 minutes later , politely ushered newly renovated interior , bustling lively incessant chatter and occasional clanking silverware.we ordered sandwich board specials , hangtown fry and shrimp & grits.the hangtown fry oyster and bacon scramble , accompanied hash and biscuit 
good here.but vegetarian/vegan types , not necessarily place , most dishes literally packed or scrambled sorts meat 
not knowing wanted sweets or salties 
gumbo " soup " or watery stuff elsewhere -- thick , luscious , savory ambrosia gods 
afraid cut corners pay said expansion.they longer serve cafe du monde chicory coffee , and replaced community coffee , roasted lafayette , ( hometown , but not intensely flavored cafe du monde coffee.the shrimp and grits , frankly , disappointing 
good flavor though.had rated brenda year ago , either or stars and well worth wait 
andouille sausage &cheddar omelette home potatoes & biscuit 
friend shrimp & goat cheese omelette grits & biscuit 
try grits & yummy 
plates huge and already semi-stuffed beignets , so bring appetite definitely here again other dishes & beignets = love restaurant 
service wait staff but gentlemen who appeared owner or manager paid much attention 
red beans and rice somewhat bland compared what used getting nola or baton rouge 
here , shrimp & cheese grits ( ) beignet flights or boy sandwiches...was amazing 
roommate bite sweet potato pancakes , rolled eyes back head , and jokingly groaned god.not missed : beignetswatermelon iced teashrimp & gritssweet potato pancakes ( rich enough serve dessert croque-monsieur heard , but beignets " " 
alright , here lowdown : get here early or late , cause somewhere middle waiting longer takes deaf man learn fiddle 
, come 12 , bring something , maybe sleeping bag , extra change clothes , good novel or two...f bring just case , point 
, deep south style anyway -- secretive or not 
) chocolate beignets : chocolate n't melted friendly service good coffee grillades & grits : beef cutlets amazing 
ordering beignets , start " order plain , chocolate , apple , crayfish , or sampler ? 
n't in.some faves : -beignets sampler-gumbo-shrimp & grits-fried chicken ( sooo good 
) -fried oyster ( or shrimp ) boy ( absolute fave ) home pickles rock and watermelon iced tea really good service usually decent 
oysters amazing , casino style or just simple heat and spice 
loved plain , chocolate good fresh chocolate filled buttery goodness , such croissant or crepe , crayfish fantastic 
coleslaw fresh and not soaked mayo and sausages must.mos def return others po'boy sandwich or banana foster french toast or other breakfast delights thumbs : , and $ 10 thumbs : eh neighborhood , but whatevers 
n't brunch ravenous or quite grumpy and gnawing arm 
dish $ or less too 
certainly fan and back whenever line n't too long or weather nice sidewalk wait 
ofcourse beignet flight ( actually just order certain ones , sweet potato pancake walnut sauce , shrimp & grits , eggs benedict and guys breakfast dishes not worth mentioning 
guess just back more andouille & chedder omelet top tier breakfast choice and even stuffed , continuously reaching taste man grillades and grits.upon getting ready leave , stomach unable handle anymore...but eyes eating 
beignets & fried chicken uh-may-zing 
first bite great , but n't dare eat few spoonfuls fear itis , heart attack , or 
good most part but first beignet experience teenager cafe du monde , other beignet compare.definitely place 
shrimp & grits pretty yummy but maybe just tad too cheesy 
food : shrimp & goat cheese omelette ( asked egg whites very tasty and cooked well 
husband grillades & grits 
food : -beignet flight : , chocolate , molten ghirardelli chocolate granny smith apple , cinnamon honey butter crawfish , cayenne , scallions & cheddar absolutely... incredible 
favorite crawfish , melts mouth...-shrimp & grits : sauted shrimp , cheddar grits , spicy tomato-bacon gravyperfection 
makes wired hours crashenvironment : -the wait drives nuts , but reward worth it.- always hard time parking , so park far away or bring big bag quarters.-you practically sitting lap person 
nutshell : food : starsp/c : starsservice : stars hour wait... ) just love when restaurants hear so much hype turns better or good expected 
definitely not cafe du monde , but suffice 
shrimp & grits time ever grit 
split beignet flight and perfect taste different types beignets savory , sweet , plain...all delicious.i ordered shrimp & grits , amazing , and amazingly heavy 
places been dying and knowing how much people raved place , figured kill birds stone place wanted and treating boyfriend breakfast.the wait place forever and wait , but immediately disclose wait list so n't or impatient then n't place 
great place breakfast or brunch , but just remember patient waiting 
biscuits buttery , moist , fluffy and awesome.you food to-go or call pick-up n't wait hour table 
n't love neighborhood or , walk hotel brenda n't great 
opted cab , something never sf usually walk or public transport 
sure try , serve plate or buy single 
brenda place not recommend strongly enough excellent food & best waitresses 
time , forgo grits and like..a biscuit or something soak gravy 
place also walking distance bart ( 20 min or less ? 
! back again when sf not expect place so small or line rainy day 
! n't such yummy beignets lived cafe du mond orleans 
flowery moulding ceiling , rustic brick , cement walls , and natural lighting make calm , pleasant ambiance , and just sitting and chatting hour longer expected probably n't , or else envious patrons waiting seat stare 
crawlfish stuffing --- how god name leaking or making thing mushy ? 
wow , crawfish beignets and shrimp & grits amazing 
taking star looong wait , but not fault popular , or maybe is.chicken , sausage , and okra gumbo amazingshrimp , cheese & grits incredibleall beignets mmm , beignets.french toast great 
easily best restaurants dined sf , or anywhere 
only or oysters 
only appealing item menu burger so ordered burger , then ordered hushpuppies and cup gumbo.the burgers w options cheese ( $ or egg ( $ 
servers too much top anything or very approachable but efficient enough 
cooked just enough , but toppings too much or too little 
, cafeteria type seating bit crowded but servers nice.the food surprisingly mostly deep fried or buttery type food personally try not more once month 
expect least hour wait arrive : 30 or 10 : 00 am 
day smile face start morning hangtown fry , biscuit , & watermelon tea 
best luck weekday or early weekend 
line usually shorter and right or wait least 10 minutes 
biscuit so perfectly fluffy and buttery , but not so heavy n't able jam or butter it.overall , service surprisingly fast , dishes mucho gusto , and prices fairly decent ( $ 11 person 
noticed servers helped point or ; looked little tired and worn , but nonetheless still amicable 
good place large groups , but good enough solo , lunch date , or friends.i 'm rating place " a-ok " timebeing , feel " meal-like " dishes first fully jumping consensus here 
watermelon ice tea hit or miss batch 
, line...so cold or raining , better time arrival right 
indifferent table or counter , and waited 30-40 minutes 
there 9am and only waited minutes but left hour or so later line grown spill 
ham & cheese omlet pretty bomb 
belly side eggs and bacon , biscuits , butter & jelly 
line , but order coffee or bloody mary wait 
walking polk street crowd people front door waiting seated , but normally n't wait , or wait consistently less 10 minutes 
ordered beignet flight , shrimp & grits , hangtown fry and side pancakes and extra biscuit 
shrimp & grits so flavorful and filling 
guess patrons not experienced much way soul food culinary delight palate or french toast just dry 
crawfish beignets : extremely filling order = large beignets and goooodsweet watermelon tea : refreshing , free refillsgrillades and grits : just been too full , but just ok. part probably buttery cream biscuit.catfish po'boy : n't order but stared enviously anyone who ordered it-- next time here giant portions reasonable price , but sadly lot dishes n't hold well leftovers lots fried , runny , or mushy items so n't many people boxing food 
what had southeast.gumbo interesting variation or deviation 
more or similar place breakfast 
andouille & cheddar omelet bunch awesome 
people dealt very nice , but server attitude pretty much " or leave , hot shit 
first thing first , plan lunch yes , even weekday 11am or 2pm 
plan other food or meal 
friend watermelon iced tea and yes quite tasty.lastly , plan hide leftovers large purse or jacket , not willing needy homeless people.p.s 
crawfish beignets and friend grillades & grits 
recommend flight includes different beignets , chocolate , granny smith apple , & crawfish ) 
main course usually w/ potato hash or grits , plus cream biscuit or toast 
grits and grillades especially , but everything had here great.i 'm not big lines or cramped dining establishments , wtf francisco ? ? 
so , brenda pace you.i 've been hearing good things brenda years , but never time or right person invest waiting street seat 
, finally opportunity out.order crawfish or plain beignets--the chocolate really heavy , and apple just n't 
& put name chalkboard & seated minutes later 
love even more mimosas or cajun bloody marys , n't deterred visiting even love libation brunch 
today specials shrimp & cheese grits tomato-bacon relish

restaurant bit small about or tables and seats wall 
yummy food & service 
place outstanding , even when & wait table ( see what there ? 
n't bother suggesting particular item , never anything here n't amazing.if line front or long list names chalkboard , n't intimidated always surprised short amount time takes seated when busy 
boyfriend and waited hour or so sat but well worth wait 
what not prepared new policy cram many large parties two-tops or counter seating expense parties been waiting more hour 
n't really tried much else n't imagine not beignet or grits 
= glad not wait & super sweet friend pay excursion ; pretty expensive dishes large portions 
tip fellow yelpers mk sure when u gt u hv yur entire party you.. place really crowded even : 30am saturday...the food however worth wait ... beignet flight , creole veggie omelette , catfish poboy,shrimp & grits and pulled pork egg benedict... everything really good and service level great.. given so many ppl waiting , didnt feel rushed.. food fresh.. 
eggs & grits now , protein and/or biscuit 10 minutes later 
eggs & grits stone cold time food arrives.i not pay $ 13 cold eggs & lukewarm grits 
hour or more wait seated but reviewer , more difficult walk 
literally bumped couple minutes or so , just n't enough room people maneuver 
what tried visits...beignets crawfishspiced cayenne , scallions and cheddarhouse favorites hangtown fry crispy oyster , bacon & scallion scramble , grits or hash , plus cream biscuit or toasthouse favorites shrimp & gritssauted shrimp , cheddar grits , spicy tomato-bacon gravyoff griddle housemade granola pancakes fruitdrizzled vanilla bean creammy only advice check weekday morning , avoid long wait 
order food , enjoy , and dont pay attention waitress , probably n't or dont want pay attention 
and grits , , so rich and creamy really only or bites and sick 
cafe fanny bay or cafe city real beignets 
biscuit dense and not greasy or overly buttered 
ordered scrambled egg whites , fluffy & delicious and cooked perfectly 
also loved how variety beignets menu -- something never seen , even cafe du monde new orleans 
thought... : good weekend brunch or day week 
didnt want raped or mugged walking home food induced stupor 
prefer hollandaise sauce little light , bit flavor instead too overwhelming.we also ordered andouille sausage & cheddar omelette , contained mushrooms , scallions , sauce piquant 
watermelon iced good , not too sweet , however taste glasses ranged how fresh or ripe watermelon 
recommend skipping others and just order instead.ordered egg & bacon tartine--was n't mindblowing , but breakfast foods and good enough happy.lastly , also sweet watermelon 
bit too much cheese , order cheese side or just cheese entirely 
chicken sausage & okra gumbo and grits quintessential creole dining 
daily specials often offer likes hangtown fry , touffe , and chicken & andouille jambalaya 
pancakes biggest and main part meal , really or broke 
decent , and filling , louisiana fare , $ 15/person , breakfast or lunch dinner slightly higher .it cool , cloudy , weekday , lunch , when decided head and give brenda try 
breakfast or lunch great , grits and shrimp po-boys best 
also choice cole slaw or fries 
atmosphere great , food totally worth price and service spectacular lived sf and wait n't so long , stopping here probably least once or twice week 
" coleslaw or fries ? 
early sunday morning or risk waiting line time , place tiny.we had : 1. beignet flight2 
as long as n't mind waiting or waking extra early 
, beignets bit thick and heavy taste.shrimp & grits fan 
what ordered : -plain beignets , yum knowledge least , nothing compare -crawfish beignets , lot cayenne pepper top , little salty taste , but inside good , still dont understand concept crawfish or what even-shrimp and grits special , too much cheese-grillades and grits , not fan meat much sauce , but then again , what grillades 
grits & lobster beignets speechless.. place star but wait ridiculous 
picture myself burned or knocking something 
shrimp & cheesy grits special so great : cheesy , spicy , tomato-y , southern greatness 
definitely here again lunch or dinner 
or prepared wait line table started flight beignets -- husband plowed savory crawfish , half apple and packed chocolate and plain so room real brunch 
highly recommend never tried food or n't decide flavor beignets get.i ordered french toast sans butter pecan sauce thought too rich half apple beignet just swallowed 
never tried authentic beignets orleans so n't just n't how brenda makes or n't period 
wait coffee shop or browse store nearby different story but really 
started crawfish beignets ( awesome , and grillades & grits spot 
great place date or girlfriends 
agreed selection italian wine black or white complements food really well

am tuesday or something really obscure so there wait 
had beignets cafe du monde , pass 
food 45 minutes ordered meghann never how food , wanted refill , or how 
really early or later or better yet weekday avoid crazy wait , or something folding chair , paper bagged booze and friends rest hungry souls patiently waiting 
choose apple pie la mode and chocolate cupcake apple & chocolate beignet 
usually fries crunchy but not point where struggling chew or bite 
parking sparse , and not much or waiting table 
superb , peach jam biscuit perfect--not too sweet or runny , tasted peach cobbler 
host really sweet and asked coffee or biscuits waited 
entrees ok , nothing spectacular or better other mom & pop places 
not so curiosity kill cat.third , sweetness : beignet flight plain , chocolate , or granny smith

tabletop space limited : ) n't decide what order menu so narrowed specials included hangtown fry ( oyster & bacon scramble w/grits or hash browns or toast ) , beans & rice , chicken ettoufee , fried catfish boy , sweet potato pancakes , or shrimp & grits 
only ever crawfish or shrimp ettoufee and feeling really hesitant dish poultry 
still cafe dogpatch plain beignets.true cafe du monde form , order cafe au lait beignets 
warning sketchy neighborhood recommend day car or someone 
advice future brenda weekend brunchers : get there early , dress appropriately , and hell , even bringing reading materials or game play dining partners.the food definitely stick-to-your-ribs type stuff

girlfriends & : croque madame , shrimp & grits & grillades & grits 
hefty & tasty portion 
cooked well , seasoned well & really n't anything better 
place very small 12 15 tables and few counter seats , and interior wo n't awards clever decorations or individuality 
brenda not skimp sausage or cheese ,

amazing beignets literally melt mouth go potrero ( yelp.com/biz/just-for-yo ) .we split eggs & bacon tartine admit mighty tasty , however nothing necessarily crave

) gumbo question n't or not... " cup or bowl ? 
" ) boy ( catfish , shrimp , or oyster... incredible ) shrimp grits ( buterrrrrrrrrry 
death lack food or drinks kfc/taco bell next door 
even parking right front.it cramped and n't decor or ambiance 
food moderately slow but not terrible but small place and rightfully popular waiting side least half hour or more 
much contemplation and debate , decided flight beignets and crispy shrimp poboy brainer known dishes and beef cutlets gravy , grits , eggs and biscuits debating order banana french toast or dish special menu 
chef here lived south or spent several years studying cajun/french cuisine 
! food actually worth stars but wait worth , thankfully nice staff also netted star or rating been lower 
bites pulled pork sammy , fried oyster po-boy , andouille and cheddar omelette , & course biscuits 
strawberry again husband and secretly hoping peach preserve asked planning jarring and selling stuff and recall planning it...crossing fingers... ) dad coffee & chicory but n't particularly love 
secret love soul food.according last roommate , best fried chicken and greens around.whenever visit family south , cracker barrel catfish breakfast.but dream brenda 's.when people farmerbrown breakfast week , brenda 's.and brenda never lets or down.even hour and half long wait weekends.it worth it.the biscuits nice , thick , and heavy , ready jam.the grillades and grits best spicy gravy around.the shrimp and grits bangin workin spice & cheddar angle.and atmosphere cozy , once , never feel rushed and staff how sure what even when sitting counter back them.so , work late monday or wednesday closed tuesdays ) and delight best southern breakfast fran 
cheese and sure ton cream or butter consistency smooth 
choice grits or potatoes 
and whomever orders most delicious thing ever and grumpy rest day wanted frittata instead lame omelet or whatever 
big mac sauce or fact breakfast food so darn good but time ordered wanted 
negative n't offer purchase or serve coffee people waiting line 
beinet dense cafe du monde , but beignets filled happiness taste buds 
perspective , grandma south georgia & louisiana ) , and such apparent mission create fat little kid outta feeding good southern food 
never been orleans or real authentic beignet but tasted good 
small joint limited table space , so n't bring homework or big hat or shopping parcels 
waiting just things life absolutely not , suggest eating here weekday or arrive 10 : 30 weekend but eating brenda definitely things life absolutely 
friend drove town and option mama ( been raving ) or brenda ( never been ) 
watermelon sweet tea something forward , but end rather had sweet tea or watermelon juice , but not way done here 
cleanest place or best service 
recommend telling friends early or when not hungry and name list 
wait table can discouraging , when food n't really matter waited long time seat or squished counter stranger 
been pleased and given stars had actually been crawfish or least shrimp touffe , but still tastiest had lived south 
; bit way , and wait makes less attractive , but well worth occasional adventure or special treat 
thought & more : vincent k. , terence s. , & the...-crawfish beignet : good 
n't really it... just -gulf shrimp & goat cheese omelette : just ok 
place fused nola , french cuisine , and soul food sounded dream come true.i arrived and told alone option sitting bar or waiting 10 min table 
staffer working line honest estimate waiting time , visited frequently and good job alerting people when tables almost ready sampled sweet potato pancakes butter pecan sauce , andouille sausage/mushroom/cheese omlet and shrimp & grits 
just spent week eating way great local nola restaurants , and orders brenda great interpretations what expect good restaurant garden district or marginy 
been orleans and original beignets pretty darn close cafe du monde 
, , okay : best part shrimp & grits 
highlights : cheesy shrimp & grits love food place 
turth so starving not tasted so good so hungry or just amazing food 
beignets not traditional cafe du mond 
holy biscuits place delicious.the boyfriend here birthday breakfast & , , probably best breakfast ever had 
mid-morning friday & actually expected wait longer 
seated four-top & promptly began salivating menu 
) & still deciding when nicely asked staff n't mind moving smaller table room bigger party 
hell , even wait sidewalk frickin food.we big & ordered flight beignets 
( birfday & gluttonous 
wonderful but crawfish definitely top , so original & full flavor 
boyfriend enjoyed andouille omelette , pondered or not shrimp & goat cheese omelette stem cells & successfully reproduce daily serve need perfection 
sadly concluded not possible & devoured meal 
oh & biscuits- delectable 
& grits- bathe 
: scrambled egg & bacon tartine gruyre and tomato-bacon relish 
prefer standard sweet tea.beignet platter very good shrimp and grits grits n't as as expected not good or not bad just different what used when lived deep south 
wait hour or , n't back 
bottom-line : douche bag rates restaurant wait , located iffy spot , small real estate or simply different amongst positive reviews 
been happy splenda or even sweet n instead sugar option sweetener 
marina girls oohed and aahed t-loin exotic tweakers , and half hour or so returned check progression line 
flavor bunch however melted chocolate filled---a orleans style pain au chocolat back food , but not beignets..i guess plan trip cafe du monde real ones 
soul food perfection.as halfway breakfast , lunch crowd started showing and wait list 20 or so people 
when pms n't restaurant absolutely or die.. 
person coffee turn and leave.... hear request or just rudely walk away ? ? ? 
immediately spot restaurant block away cluster or people waiting seated 
brenda small establishment best suited small parties or , preferably 
n't decide potato hash or grits sophie choice ? 
, wait long & only ever gotten seated counter , but completely worth 
first visit just so-so , egg and bacon tartine & hangtown fry 
also beignet sampler plate & easily found favorite crawfish beignet 
grits perfect w/ shrimp & omg , relish bomb 
eggs benedict w/ catfish & biscuit also delicious , but again , maybe just bit too heavy 
foresee bunch repeat visits brenda future -- & omg , take-out ? ? 
n't stuck cramped corner , mirror huge mirror side restaurant , probably place bigger or wall 
" line , ironically , long conversation elderly ladies who ohio and assured wait worth it.true word , waitress emerged 20 minutes and allowing few groups ) and called roll parties walked or given and struck list 
general not fan overly sweet ghirardelli chocolates and lack subtlety , concoction clearly ghirardelli plus something else or else higher end dark chocolate option collection not tasted 
brenda only or blocks apartment , and name next time or possibly take 
thought place as yummy as cafe du monde coffee and beignets new orleans but not comparable 
sister lunch here friday afternoon and able , 30mins or so 
attempted here times prior sat or sun and not been willing wait hr 
place wonderful feel yummy southern home cooking or really hearty breakfast 
wait hectic so either arrive earlier or weekdays 
ordered beignet flight ( , granny smith apple , chocolate & crawfish ) and grillades & grits 
love that crunch shrimp sarah lee bread and choice fries or cole slaw and fries n't that great 
too hot inside ( air circulation & just n't feel comfortable sitting counter 
recommend brenda breakfast , brunch , or lunch lieu dinner 
or maybe just hyped and didnt live exepctations , but hell here , well try it.we tried pancakes , catfish sandwich , and also bacon , eggs and something 
just eat bit here or when open 
much traffic road sf time and meter hour max [ been quarter or minutes , so and set alarm feed meter ] 
sure polite people pretend not or tune 
used few sliced/browned bananas , imho.sides & entrees : ordered side sweet potato hash , accompanied molasses pork chop [ how pork ] and n't normally sides monitor quantity , but exception and goodness , awesome 
including smothering blackberry or apricot jam and butter [ why get toast ? 
] monstrous buttermilk biscuit , baked en croute , and mayhaps phantom pineapple upside pancakes [ snooze maybe ? 
] beignets chocolate , , yesgumbo excellent , but last time burnt.shrimp & grits grad school south , and bit too much flavor sauces , too much cheese and not enough grits.i beignets alone , but rest just ok super rich and buttery .3.5 starsbut adjusted wait = star 
glad n't full plate shrimp & grits ; dish looked big bowl cheese grits few shrimp top , and been too much good thing 
, half people line hipsters , so compare and contrast lcd soundsystem panic disco or something 
omelette choice sides : potato hash or grits potato and cream biscuit or toast biscuit .the omelette and sides great 
type person who wake morning line front mama or dottie still wearing thick grandma sweater and half-opened , half-shut eyes.for brenda , n't even consider there weekend 
n't even care to-go box.i 'll stick mama or dottie next time 
recall beignets cafe du monde orleands and light and fluffy best ever , everyday breakfast when there .my boyfriend looked sampling beignets and " so underwhelmed 
visit 1came saturday president weekend & arrived : 55 
visit 2regular saturday , arrived : 40 & waited 10-15 minutes 
wait definitely vary day & time 
super crowded : 30 or 10 
crawfish good little spicy & different sweet ones 
together well , roll nicely toasted & crunchy and bacon crispy 
sharing beignet flight , pretty full & n't much dish 
had cafe monde french quarter , and way too tough and dense.so okay , pretty average breakfast , highlight or 
why recommend showing 10 : 30 or so weekday 
never flight and then next time stick favorite.because world biggest sweet tooth always french toast or pancakes 
thought just been ordered shrimp or something but friend order andouille and cheddar omlette also watery 
sampled beignets world well , cafe du monde nola and kyoto train station 
sense way hole wall , time slightly run risk elbowing someone head depending where sitting or side 
never been big pecans or anything tasted pecan,but french toast wanting try more butter pecan anything 
small hole literally and yes maybe elbow few people head or side now and then , wait depending when pretty long , and yes or people pitch genius tale why spare and dollar and cents,but really worth great service , flavourful andouille and cheddar omelette or cooked almost perfect french toast butter pecan sauce 
grits good too but prepared buttery creaminess overload 0_oi recommend high-town fry oyster and bacon type scramble ) and watermelon sweet tea well street parking plentiful but @ $ hour , bring dem quarters or parking card 
fries tasted mcdonalds fries..just not salty.-eggs & bacon tartine w/ hash 
pulling chain or not , thought creole tomato sauce best thing plate.ambiance ? 
creole veggie omelet potato hash and biscuit , very flavorful , and other friend shrimp omelet , potato hash and biscuit solid selection.a bit advice first timers n't discouraged wait or brusqueness list nazi , only job 
super hot asian lady waiting brunch , or admirers , place 
$ 8.00 crawfish , cayenne , scallions & cheddar beignet tasty 
wait...scratch , cloud : n't liquor license what bacon and oysters mimosa or ? focus friend john intently , or risk sucked-in ass crack woman sitting counter but worst complain , suppose not great writer , or found exceptional new breakfast joint...knee-deep tenderloin less.oh , and homeless , kinda handicapped man who loitered/ pestered awaiting entry : told cash 
only time here year or ago , so review long due 
walk fatlace and buy stickers then walk back and time party seated : love shrimp & grits entre , crawfish beignets , and broiled oysters absolutely amazing 
side fries or coleslaw 
friend po boy sandwich loved..another friend ordered beignets flight n flavors... loved crawfish & chocolate... n also raved watermelon iced tea..the omelette good but friend loved grits 
only thing sucks kitchen bathroom & waitress yelled friend attempting letting know.. screw 
only thing ice cream or whipped cream , but even , perfect 
never been orleans or south , eaten enough great meals soulful cooking when taste and n't why anyone ever complain brenda n't taste authentic orleans grub friend done 
rescuing poor beignet horrors tenderloin garbage bin , people sitting next told same thing graciously offered half beignet and agreed tasted great ( not big fan apples desserts but , , people picking food other plates n't choosers and perfect way end such savory meal.by end meal , passed point eating satisfy hunger or even enjoy taste and felt marathon runner who just honor finishing race , matter how long finish 
group wait about hours or least how long waited rain 
had better omelettes better or similar price 
likely go back and try again so try egg and bacon tartine ( bacon , scrambled egg , gruyre and tomato-bacon relish toasted french roll or possibly go back lunch.oops , hold 
here healthy hearty breakfast or brunch 
then check specials usually amazing pancake or french toast concoction 
recommendations : -get early before breakfast rush or wait forever-one entree plus beignets plenty food people-do n't big post-brenda plans , bed calling name 
always benedicts such cat fish or fried chicken 
big portions , when group still greedy heffers where order beignet flight or pancakes 
better , how pumpkin pancakes and eggs & grits 
, or maybe try 
breakfast or rather other meal beignets 
: orleans born & raised and search delicious , domilise 's-esque oyster poboy.brenda takes orleans style food and lays interesting twist 
, just n't loads salt crawfish beignets , or lack concept and flavoring scramble , or southwest aioli oyster poboy.fyi oyster poboys orleans not served hoagie rolls 
quality french bread makes or breaks poboy dirty dirty and good shit involves heavenly and spongy oil-based oaf crust flakes 
not quite light and airy , example , cafe du monde 
great biscuits , tender & little flaky homemade jam 
southern style menu just fun see.down sides : yelled biker front restaurant exited taxi and n't really paying attention.. err wait n't anything restaurant.the beignets not great-- very cute theory , just tasted overgrown doughnut holes filled apples or crawfish or chocolate 
shrimp and grits never claim perfectionist art grits but here cant fail receipe brenda staff note grits , half half or whipping cream real butter unsalted then half water 
boil whipp stir stir stir cream solid white wo n't stick or clump 
morning pick coffee & chocolate beignets bring back work 
early or later afternoon n't wait 
place packed slight 10-15 minute or so wait 
doubt breanda worth wait , shine or rain 
thick , generous lots sausage and other goodies , and soothed hangover & starved soul 
brunch companion loved , too , and literally cleaned plate and gave very happy , satisfied nod & smile 
coffee dark and strong just how imagine cafe du monde.as usual..parking sucks...be prepare feed meters 
favorite breakfast times , and loyal fan chicken and waffles , n't missing chicken and waffles much.also.. menu try sweet potato pancakes perfectly fluffy , light , thick hint spice , served homemade brown sugar-butter-pecan caramel sauce or chicken etouffe hot , spicy , chickneny 
brendas or miss opinion when dish order 
shoulda ordered kinda breakfast plate or sandwich looked pretty darn good 
pull together , or risk losing biggest fans 
or 10 tables and seats counter ; holds 35-40 people 
too much food and yes , denser and heavier ones boulette or cafe monde.3 ) still swear gumbo and waiting gallon jug size available grocery store.4 ) anything special board molasses ham 
( make or break kind legit sammie 
brought bacon , n't or order bacon , crazy ) but n't charged either 
come hungry , or sure someone share 
french roll toasted outside bacon grease and bacon meh.the grits made throw little mouth , added butter then not sure what killed first , clot heart or excessive gagging 
so confused savory adding salt or sweet adding well , sugar 
but , what beignet due watching cooking shows or wasting time skimming cookbooks library.anyways , place bomb-tastic beignets...in size , flavour , and colour 
) yummy menu , decor classic and clean lots natural light , and staff friendly , attentive , and non-pretentious , hit or miss sf hotspots 
here girlfriends sunday afternoon & waited hour 
started beignet sampler--plain , chocolate , apple , & crawfish

low down : -3 apple cinnamon beignets : completely honest and nothing beignets cafe du monde orleans 
n't excited when someone mentions beignets or mardi gras party , so low expectations brenda 
lunch , 11 or pm 
overall , food good but not spectacular or special 
great little spot late night snacks or brunch morning 
order plain , chocolate , apple/cinnamon , or crawfish...or get flight and taste 
beignets little larger and tougher remember cafe du monde , but , still works.i oyster/bacon scramble time , absolutely delicious 
and grits usually n't grits , but somehow , brenda made such way actually ate more just mouthful.the service always been friendly and attentive , wait staff sometimes little overwhelmed , but forgiven time first bit food hits palate.if more standard brunch fare , or brunch jazzed bit , definitely head brenda 's...absolutely , totally worth 
anxious try pretty much menu and ended ordering way too much food people.crawfish & sausage beignets orders gumbo2 brunch entrees1 order grits1 order biscuits totally satisfied , n't wait next sunday verdict : wait long but food makes big way 
good blend corned beef , potatoes , veggies , and seasoning , mushed , pan fried , and served eggs and biscuit or grits .i eggs easy so break yolks and smother hash 
connected hotel.come early or late , maybe 11 or 
pieces advice early or expect wait awhile 
never more delicious shrimp and grits or jambalaya or beignets 
shrimp & goat cheese omelet grits and biscuit yummy 
let count ways...1 ) gumbo2 ) biscuits3 ) beignetsoh , & wishes comin true 
also very loud , nothing walls or ceiling muffle noise closely-packed diners.we ordered flight beignets start , but quickly realized mistake , so just split apple and rest home 
portion ridiculous--i leftovers plus leftover crawfish beignet dinner and stuffed.i eggs & grits , and good , but not mind-blowing 
wish n't so crowded or often 
there little early , 11 : 30 or so , but there already ( short line space 
time left , midst lunch rush , wait quite sizeable , so come early or prepared wait.i settled scrambled eggs oyster and bacon well biscuits and grits sides choice several options luckily 
service fast & friendly 
said once and again...it expectations : expect wait 45 minutes ( read : friend place , run errand , or nap street corner putting name expect tiny sf style restaurant where barely enough room breathe ( read : leave giant coat , shopping bags , and big hair home expect served best , most authentic , full-flavored cuisine had years 
peet & starbucks here pass teeny slice banana bread more 
quality food top notch , but questionable wheter or not brave wait again...i easily convinced so 
wait pretty ridiculous n't small party or right when open 
freakin awesome , shrimp & grits , flight beignets crawfish best... ) , oyster omelet , cup gumbo and incredibly light , incredibly fluffy , incredibly delicious biscuit 
barely enough cheese or crawfish really match thick , heavy fried dough surrounding 
also n't offer reduce fat/ non-fat milk host actually looked leaf clover or something 
luckily enough , thursdays n't so happenin 10 : 30 or so 
& crowd full swing time and service experience crappie 
trust week breakfast or evening dinner 
neely and paula cooking lose appeal talk bostoninan or yankee accent food network shows

n't duper greasy or anything 
food fabulous , creative , & fresh 
bunch soul food places sf bluejay , nickies , farmer brown , cajun pacific...but none touch brenda 's.- crawfish beignets kick serious ass oozing hot melted cheese , green onions & crawfish bite 
large size meal inself get cup try other items- oysters boy crisp , plump & fresh- also shared order shrimp & cheese grits , giant bowl super cheesy grits mounds bacon bits & plenty-o-shrimp also egg & bacon tartine , egg-cellent- watermelon okay , little murky taste 
been gotten chocolate filled or apple 
waited 10 minutes or so and different server diners table 
thought maybe used wipe white boards or clean gas station bathrooms so dirty looking 
n't super good or super bad 
( , n't spell , or well 
then sweet potato dumplings healthy , or healthy soul food 
whatever least helpful enough order , or so thought 
, fluffy biscuits , buttery grits and excellent , unique ( cajun omelette , example shrimp & spices yet inexpensive food 
ordered eggs way ; hash browns or grits plus biscuit or toast 
shrimp & grits comparable dying and heaven , and shrimp poboy second none 
bf veggie omelet , good , but biscuit , so incredibly good tons butter or buttermilk 
here alone wednesday morning or : 30 
ham : sounded great maple glaze or something , but actually really dry 
figure right , and wait very reasonable.they need expand or open 
too salty or spicy last time 
really idea n't or human but only table and pretty much throw coffee and food 
even when gave bill handing baton relay and n't or even slow passing 
) shrimp & grits ( bit oily/greasy , but good flavor ) pumpkin pancakes ( bit bread-like , but good ) bfc ( biscuits great ) ta try watermelon tea ( not too sweet ) .would definitely again 
recommend calling ahead or putting name list and then somewhere else 
here bay area there service n't perfect , or even somewhat indifferent , but n't lived bad service big apple 
recommend splitting entrees starving or carry own defibrillator 
n't complain even tables or people sitting 
dear yelp review reading person,please n't here.we want brenda and awesome brunch ourselves--from yummy beignets , fresh & strong coffee 
time or other 
n't fit table or stomachs 
okay waiting awhile table and possibly sitting elbow elbow friendly stranger , wait & seating arrangement worth wait , most flakiest bisquits , & most delicious grits ever 
watermelon iced tea refreshing & tasty , too 
not fan corn bread or stuffing but love brenda cornbread stuffing 
potato/sweet potato hashes and beignets fried doughnut things sugary or savory depending what pick good well 
there when open , or ready super long wait 
really dbl profits better neighborhood or bigger location , but decrease likability restaurant 
not regular coffee drinker really only coffee brunch once or twice month 
yes.i beignet flight ( apple cinnamon , plain , chocolate & crawfish crawfish beignet best described as " interesting " ... not sure ever order again and gumbo... yummy ( especially hot sauce added

ordered grillades & grits 
, " beef cutlets braised spicy creole gravy , served grits & eggs style , plus cream biscuit or toast 
sister and friend split creole veggie omelette & french toast butter pecan sauce 
stolen whole thing not been distracted what definitely highlight what ordered meal , shrimp & grits.the shrimp & grits absolutely amazing and not disappoint 
slept hours when home.i definitely return shrimp & grits incredible combo flavors , and definitely return po'boy

suggest party or more table 
" and content day progressed longing beignet , or just biscuit , and more delectable food 
early or late weekday 
( little bitter & too much rhind flavor 
, bathroom located past kitchen back , so order , past steaming hot grills , apologize cooks way , and risk burned or knocking something 
, brenda small , but definitely worth hour wait & sitting shoulder-to-shoulder everyone else place 
n't standing much , little benches or chairs people waiting 
love crawfish & cheddar ones soon 
ordered flight beignets , shrimp & grits , watermelon ice tea 
cheddar grits and biscuit , so actually better pick shrimp & grits shrimp 
waitress perfect timing when refills or order 
food had sf , or life matter , not experience had when first bite 
, table pretty much silent only lifting heads or clearing mouth conversation , only comment how delicious food , or waitress more water 
n't exactly french or exactly soul food 
easier or single 
fluffy , chewy pillow steaming goodness cafe monde or morning , but flat , tough , bored piece flattened fried dough so little powdered sugar daddy 
only complaint really tiny , so early or plan wait 
bacon & egg tartine : french bread warm , soft and buttery just right amount garlic 
( 2nd time ; 1st time hour & 45 minutes.beignets pretty good 
assume most californians n't what creole & soul food 
food so good here bring extra pair underwear when bit seafood donut or milk biscuit and pants.that good dude 
mental weakness or empty stomach prevent staying name called ? 
explaining frustration , rather apologizing or explaining nicely , woman spoke extremely rude and normally close : 30 insinuating lucky closed so late time .having worked restaurants , understand wanting create situation where employees home decent hour , but case , then restaurant closes : 30 and leave 
amazing items ordered or sampled : -fried shrimp po-boy pretty good , but not big sandwiches ; -sweet watermelon oh delicious , and free refills -beignet flight fried awesomeness , personal fav crawfish ; -grillades and grits far best dish , grillades super tasty , grits made perfect consistency , texture grits dont get lost butter and cheesy goodness.-shrimp and grits shrimp juicy , plump and tender , grits delicious.-biscuits love 
beignets , recommend ordering plain or crawfish 
not too impressed chocolate or apple ones 
most delicious biscuit and grits or potatoes 
n't really feelin watermelon tea or n't mood maybe next time 
n't cut too close closing , or miss out.- good things worth waiting 
expected something done , bite something else chef apology , or comping beignets , or something....but nothing sort happened 
there little earlier or later seat long wait.and n't forget watermelon iced tea 
, just commitment grillades & grits ( beef cutlets braised creole gravy , served grits w/2 eggs and biscuit wandering eye notice mirrored " specials " board.....there : sweet potato pancakes walnuts and brown butter 
place tiny also probably smaller posh spice closet .the line top deep and 40 minutes or so , and parking 
sampling french doughnuts plain and rest stuffed gooey chocolate , spiced apples or savory crawfish 
not sure how itred beans & rice w/ andouille sausage : really good , flavorful nice kick spice new hangout 
lucky or sleep or sleep and here.you really adam and here food ev-er 
, when inebriated or otherwise exercising bad judgement , bacon 
or least order crawfish beignets 
omelets & grits & biscuits , just tremendous 
shrimp & goat cheese omelet better andouille & cheddar , but very good and nice sauces 
realized yelpers n't exaggerating when wait till cows home table or bar seat 
pros : taste almost everything menuyou smart enough bring mister so fork cash pay bill or least was. 
fried shrimp or fried oyster po-boy ( so f'ing fantastic ) shrimp but oyster great too.4 
monsieur gruyere sandwich ham , gruyere cheese and delicious sour dough bread toasted or fried tasted good 
places where depends what order... i shrimp and grits... mmm... mouth watering just thinking it.... definitely best shrimp and grits experiences i ever had ( however , i so grits expert ... i sure i loved amount shrimp , texture , and hint spiciness....we ordered beignet flight... and ( least instance too dry and crunchy taste... crawfish best bunch and if/when i back i probably just order those... other people party content food... dishes solid but not special... i definitely back catfish eggs benedict so hopefully live shrimp & grits 
lunch or time 10am 
grillades and grits , andouille sausage & cheddar omelette , and eggs benedict catfish 
traditional beignets still pale comparison cafe du monde , maybe dough , or maybe lack powdered sugar , but way still delicious.i 've only been here once , but plan again sample more place fine cuisine and review...plus , head chef filipino orleans , just 
course , prepared early , head crowds or long wait 
monday morning , so n't worry wait or anything 
bit dry middle , but really minor complaint and nothing ruin flavors or meal.the granola pancakes really amazing 
decided d/c boxes area , left wander streets wondering nearby noon pick-ups fyi , none thus far , guess federal building or fox plaza drop mail 
, piping hot & fresh , shame not experience warm deliciousness 
take casual carpool early days and try em 8am weekday......and then try real breakfasts ooo , last bit , woman who take order remembered name and thanked way door....nice touch update 1/24/08i andouille sausage & cheddar omelette last week , and today corned beef hash , side grits and leftovers home tomorrow breakfast 
possibly best ever , n't butter or jam even hash yummy , very scallion-y and potato-y , rather corned beef , so not meat fest 
sausage & cheddar omelette-wow andouille sausage kick ? 
today wet & freezing , so there only other peeps waiting let 8am spicy shrimp grits , catfish eggs benedict , and sweet potato pancakes here basically blackout writing yelp post 
also order granny smith apple beignets , super sweet & yummy , even reheated couple hours later.the servers very nice -- complaints there 
ordered beignets , andouille & cheddar omelette , special omelette fried oysters and banana foster $ 30 
early or waiting line rest hipsters 
try catfish po boy or catfish benedict 
seated stool facing mirrored wall and ordered beignet sampler crawfish , apple , regular , and chocolate $ , not able choose sweet or savory , and daily special oyster and farmed bacon scramble $ 11 
dish came grits or potatoes and toast or biscuit 
" nothing $ 10 " philosophy , brenda economical choice great food and service.if going lunchtime , recommend going early or late possible avoid lunchtime rush 
regular menu , try fried shrimp or fried oyster po-boys , served chipotle rmoulade toasted french roll $ 9.25 
sandwich dishes served bread-and butter pickle chips , plus choice french fries or cole slaw.the sweet watermelon ( $ 2.25 house specialty , fresh-made daily real watermelon.overall , n't fork money fly big easy , brenda french soul food great alternative 
bacon and egg tartine or whatever called 
almost fell when waitress asked wanted " sweet or regular " iced tea 
n't question normally asked a1000 miles pacific.now just forward back earlier day beignets plain , powdered sugar just cafe du monde ) 
food okay , not great or amazing...if n't miserably cramped quarters and hour wait time , written high 
offer coffee or small piece pastry been welcome sign 30 people waiting and certainly held impending headache not eating... 
not huge fan potatoes grits or homefries.. 
awesome crawfish good savory mood , but recommend apple pie makes south & warm summer night 
, send way amazing biscuits & grits , homemade jam had ages , and wondefully delicious home-cooked tasting food $ 10 
chicken , sausage & okra gumbo sooooo good 
sample fried chicken nephew ordered and also rice & beans andouille sausage 
service excellent yesterday attentative waitress who also friendly ; however , today , different waitress and not joyful yesterday , but secretly wished & blessed lots love n't trip attitude usually big tipper , but got bare minumum ...overall , great restaurant tenderloin 
early or late...who am kidding ? 
threes and n't decide plain , chocolate , granny smith or crawfish- get flight and get each.wash bottomless sweet watermelon tea.it back hot summer days georgia...sitting front porch and watching grass grow 
crawfish first and then others meal dessert or to-go 
brunch or even lunch 
yet taste lunch , doubts not unsatisfying taste or expectations 
very friendly , very hospitable , and not leave eyeing or wondering wave hand refill coffee 
unfair compare cafe du monde , but even called donut still just bad 
coffee : good- watermelon iced tea : n't great , little funky and just watermelon beer 21st amendment mmmmm beignet flight : good ( well n't chocolate , but n't chocolate freak , but friend good ) , particularly crawfish , ohhh sooo yummmmy- andouille cheddar omelet : ehhh , omelet spectacular , but pretty high standards when omelets or eggs general guess...but sides 
service average ; nothing norm or anything lacking particular 
suggest small groups or less place seriously tiny 
n't decide chocolate or apple 
day or not 
lee sandwich or saigon sandwich 
chock full ingredients chocolate or apple cinnamon spice , or great plain 
grillades & grits and omelet delicious and watermelon ice tea also very tasty 
dirty... " n't raise voice or scene 
" nothing wrong action or attitude 
then box , turned , still pissy hell , anything so n't new order , or throw away 
order plain view very satisfying and worth $ $ .definitely worth trip or two.i recommend friends and eating family style so experience variety fare 
so cute brenda left , or right when sf 
dishes little hit or miss , and almost everything menu very heavy 
also granola pancakes also really good ( but admittedly nothing extraordinary eggs benedict or beignets 
place quite " cozy " prepared wait or early and beat rush.for lunch gumbo good , when nola , gumbo bit thicker consistency and less broth-y 
avoid peak hours and fine people or less 
brought attention host patiently waiting turn 40 minutes , n't care or compassion , simply n't anything and just list 
happy familiar things crystal brand hot sauce , ceramic jars mustard and homemade preserves instead jam or jellies 
remembered when visit aunt louisiana or cafe du monde quarter.like others , really wish brenda business well and expand larger space ... and maybe add other french soul food favorites menu quiche , gator soup , shrimp etoufette , etc 
party or more , sure face hostess , not easily overlooked so many people leave wait 
worries , hear food great and got great company... or so hear and read... beignet flight start , : daily special pancakes , french toast , tartine , benedict and shrimp & grits ordered seconds sitting 
and lacked true sophistication... poached eggs spot , scrambled eggs soft omelet fillings , pancakes nearly inch thick middle and thin outside , making resemble track & field discus 
chocolaty us... chocolate pudding or mousse filling been taste , apple : okay , plain : ones cafe dumonde orleans much lighter and loads powdered sugar.breakfast : hubby got special bacon/tomato eggs benedict 
house favorites : grillades & grits 
2pm saturday so wait n't more 10 or so minutes 
work city , van ness , or tendernob , here lunch 
time or past time breakfast or brunch or whatever 
choose ot next time hungry and early ( or not so early francisco 
wait table , hiding sunglasses , or newspaper , great cross-section francisco culture 
comped or getting entire restaurant oj binge 
groups or more probably more difficult accommodate 
ordered1 watermelon iced tea love & refills too sweet potato pancakes ginger pecan sauce zing & very hearty 
& huge & 1/4 " thick 
bits sweet potatoes.3 sampler beignets dense & bit overfried 
hoping light & fluffy yours.4 ) gulf shrimp & goat cheese omelette : yummy tummy 
shrimp tasted fresh & omelette shaped hot pocket 
buy glass milk soy or order yogurt parfait 
n't recommend place friends or collegues 
come early or come late 
buttery & yummy 
good & gooey more 
just n't group guys then probably pee 'd pants or turned and called cab 
not quite what imagined but still good nonetheless.i think place nice try once or twice but n't way again especially walk tenderloin ) here 
visits wanted linger order cup coffee , open newspaper or just enjoy great music 
, this.... salsa top omelet store bought or just generic 
not big fan and preferred side or just not included 
attempted brenda many times but gave idea bc wait always long and slow--no matter time , early : 30am or late 1pm even rainy day--you tons umbrellas brenda ) 
ethan , or eden main server and grrrreeeeeat 
, good breakfast and love back and try dinner or lunch 
beignet flights plain , ghiradelli chocolate , apple & crawfish ) pretty good 
beignets little bit more dense or little lighter 
pure melted chocolate middle , when expecting something more pudding or something not so darn heavy 
, n't boxes or least aluminum paper hot partially eaten chocolate beignet 
nom nom nom nom nom.it really small space , so n't bring big parties here , and n't surprised hanging jacket strangers chair , or sharing little bit butt space seat.but what ? 
future , suggest solo or double ride here 
had several different dishes , shrimp & goat cheese omelette and shrimp and grits special 
recommend taking public transportation or walking parking nearby metered and long line 10 or so parties waiting 
cafe au lait , french toast , pancakes regular and sweet potato , scrambled eggs , and omelettes goat cheese/shrimp and creole veggie so-so , portions large but taste unimpressive.what recommend there line forms 10 am , sitting bar paper or novel and ordering cup coffee and delicious crawfish beignets or homemade biscuits 
something different then seedy vietnamese places then brendas great place lunch or breakfast 
( screen door portland , or or maybe just 
absurd glass water lemon slice or wedge 
n't decide beignets with...plain , chocolate , apple or crayfish ? 
sure bring friend or cuz not good when em home 
wait , patience or earlier and worth 
bay area or visiting definitely check 
problems hunger waiting table or even later meal risk coronary doubles bite 
recommend shrimp and goat cheese omelette , catfish benedict & grillades and grits 
highly recommend and return again breakfast and later try lunch or dinner 
n't fan chocolate but also n't care chocolate general so n't influence order or not 
finally entree , shrimp & grits dank 
anything recommend not oysters casino shrimp & grits just similar tastes bacon and cheese ) but delicious 
people inspiration political or religious figures , but , chef 
ultimate brunch destination terms filling appetite , curing hangover or just gorging puke 
experience star or less extra star 
felt eating bbq ribs or similar not same spices meatloaf 
not salt person occasional margarita n't lost shaker or not , so very odd 
n't feel need back , maybe biscuit or 
only brave once or twice year too impatient 15-minute line , alone standard hour-long wait 
shrimp & grits and crawfish beignets awesome line long , duh 
crawfish flavored , easily eating or lunch 
breakfast options include ommlettes , house-made biscuits , and potatoes or , ahem , grits 
ta back and try gumbo and beignets... ta crawfish beignets , fried chicken eggs benedict & watermelon iced tea 
hubby andouille omelet and really " old school " meaning not fluffed or pretentious.and n't started peach preserves. 
" worth wait " word wise , lunchtime weekdays or noon weekend 
early weekends or weekdays 
pancakes too , but definitely share or half order otherwise , risk death , diabetes , or worse ; , and n't there dinner... only breakfast and lunch 
servers friendly and efficient moving tables rude or rushing diners 
good news when visited lunch month or so ago only group ahead so seated right away 
signature flavors-plain ( good ) , apples & cinnamon ( meh ) , chocolate ( heavenly ) and crawfish ( winner ) 
seriousness , best brenda : 30a or waiting more hour place big walk-in closet 
just n't kind biscuit hoping maybe bad , non-buttered or something ? brenda kitchen and lot customers knew 
weekday lunch , oyster po boy fries or coleslaw glad chose coleslaw prepared just how it-not too sweet and not too heavy dressing perfectly balanced flavor 
watermellony , but not overwhelming or fake 
such thing philipino creole , n't exist creole french mixed caribean and or native american and sometimes portuguese , , fourth lesbian man haters not very francisco 
remember go early avoid lines and prepared wait hours weekend or holiday 
n't begin how much love cajun/creole food ; especially shrimp & oyster po'boys 
twice restaurant planning enjoy nice , leisurely meal friends or loved ones 
treatment , friends or back 
wait or food ? heard place friend who " damn good " 
or wrong , had mouth watering dreams brenda vegan josephine 
baked en croute ordered once before pretty tasty well 
suggest ordering not long wait weekends or not mood strangers 
seating area tiny and bound elbow or meal 
bit sad shrimp & grits menu 
worth hour or so wait 
definition tartine french open-faced sandwich , especially rich or fancy spread 
customers order beingets or even 
: just dottie , maybe even better.very small place , so groups or lessof course , specials written mirror wall besttried beignet flight , but pass b/c very thick dough rather lightthe sweet potato pancakes ridiculously good -- thick , fluffy , sweet , drizzled syrup , just incredibleenjoyed fried oyster and bacon omelette biscuit and grits u butter grits -- load fried oyster po boy -- guaranteed hit u ok deep fried watermelon sweet tea and hash also good waited more hour seated 
why gave stars total very encouraging & discouraging arrive breakfast spot weekend meal and lineup street

yummy but less barely finish egg & bacon tartine sandwich grits really good just too much food 
been good meal , but food soon cook done making , not 20-30mins or however long been sitting underneath heat lamp

ultimate winner : baked en croute ( $

overall good place brunch or lunch 
& sacramento ( 12-14-09 fellow yelpers.. 
also choice hash browns or grits and biscuit or toast 
boy sandwich basically deep fried seafood choice oysters , catfish or shrimp tomatoes , lettuce , and chipotle remoulade sauce tucked inside grilled french roll 
pickles side and choice fries or slaw 
tired , poor , or hungry , just expect wait , boy not , but still great 
brunch : shrimp and grits , watermelon iced tea , crawfish beignets beignet flight but really , crawfish or plain beignets way 
n't quite spicy , but overdone paprika left tasting bit too wood-y , or cardboard-y 
been long time rather 7-eleven coffee or mcdonalds coffee what served , really sour coffee 
coffee chicory makes feel back french quarter , enjoying nice snack cafe du monde 
ta there early weekends or lunch....if not , expect wait 
who not collard greens easily substitute mac & cheese well worth it.the craw fish beignets crispy , light , chewing easily but improved little craw fish filling ( not deal breaker good 
parking pain too meters $ 0.25 minutes or something crazy 
seated faster n't mind sitting counter facing giant mirror starring or refection other people food 
n't wait crocque monsieur , or oyster po'boy 
breakfast food or lunch food huge dilemma menu contained many crescent city and soul food favorites been craving fried seafood po boys , grits and grillades , black eyed peas and collard greens wonderfully appealing creole-inspired breakfast menu 
beignet flight favorite apple hint nutmeg and also chocolate well always chocolate but brought great memories churros con chocolate spain dark rich & thick chocolate 
hubby expectations little bit lower always been cafe du monde beignet fan 
perhaps decadent breakfast or meal ever had 
beignets really good but not worth hour wait or nastiness 
brenda really dissapointing meal & service.... -_- 'm not fan usually type food , but excellent french/soul food...this place 
( , dont how new but once or twice week and never back then deal : wait few and waitress and " ready ? 
minutes later and " hear or not coffee 
, when lovely host who job seat next name list , dont yell " pick " or rush and " , sharon party still here " 
not spare inch inside restaurant people milling waiting table or counter seat 
thought putting huge mirror people bar stare very vain or bad sense humor 
tiny tenderloin jem salivating pumpkin pancakes covered butter pecan sauce or chorizo cheddar omletes biscuit , grits or potato hash 
totally place dozen yuppified pac hieghts or valley time folks get love too 
only thing remember someone not liking drink kind juice ) .the beignets also good , but missing something n't excite way excite lot other diners.try going off-peak hours early lunch or late ) avoid long line and shady polk street corner

surprised but made effort or try business 
swallowing bite , turning friend or not best thing ever tasted 
10 bucks or per entree 
favor sf or visiting and brenda 
hands-down favorite group gumbo so rich and full flavor , and happy woman time tasted morsel chicken or chorizo 
wanted croque monsieur highly recommended and specialties , and good , n't quite as satisfying as egg scramble or gumbo , partially probably flavor n't as strong 
split shrimp poboy and catfish poboy friend , decide or other
