Came here on Ike's Birthday (Saturday 03/26/16), and we got a free drink and chips! It was on my list of places to try while visiting San Francisco, and I was not disappointed.Tip: There's no tables & chairs inside...So, we parked on the street and ate in our car, then walked around the Castro/Mission District afterwards.I ordered the Paradise Found & my boyfriend ordered the Menage a Trois, both on their Dutch bread with lettuce and tomatoes. These two sandwiches made the perfect combination of sweet and savory.
Being a San Franciscan my whole life, last Friday was the first time I had Ike's Place. I know, I cant believe it myself. I never did because I was told the awful wait time. I got Good Friday off and decided to wait if needed but I actually placed my order on eat 24. Eat 24 said my order was ready. When I got there, the line was not too long and the amount of people waiting isn't too bad. About 12pm when i got there but 10 mins later, the line was out the door. Check in with the staff about my order but they couldn't find my order. I'm thinking, they gave it to someone else? It's okay, he took our order and food was ready in 15mins. I wasn't upset because it was such a nice day. Either call or order ahead but they will tell you it's about 60 min before your order is ready. I was so excited. I got myself the **MATT CAIN made with Godfather Sauce, Provolone, Roast Beef, Salami, and Turkey on dutch crunch. My friend got the Menage A Trois made with BBQ, Cheddar, Halal Chicken, Honey Mustard, Pepper Jack, Real Honey, and Swiss on dutch as well. The sandwiches are huge, could only eat half. Ate the other half the next day. It was really good. Love the **Godfather Sauce made with horseradish, and chipotle mayo. Went prefect with my Matt Cain. The bread had a prefect crunch. YUM! I need to try their HOT sandwiches with Halal Chicken next time. I can't wait to go back to ike's place, sitting at dolores park on a nice day to have my sandwich again.
sorry bout the picture for being partially eaten, i didn't think I was gonna make this review but after a couple of bites I decided I had to. I got the mnage a trois. It was soooooo good that I bought my gf one but ended up eating hers too. I'm not from SF so this place was a myth to me. Once I finally got it tho, it was lit. Like the store itself was hip and pretty cool. Steph Curry posters everywhere. Definitely a must try if you're in SF, although they just opened one up in SD. PRO TIP: they offer free add-ons for some stuff and if you're Asian like me, I like free stuff and food. Add everything bro, I got extra red onions, bell peppers, and other sweetness.
What a let down! I've been hearing about Ike's Place for quite a while so naturally having Ike's famous Manage a Trois (~$13) on dutch bread was on my SF bucket list.Unfortunately, this sandwich's caliber has a negative correlation with its reputation. The bread takes up at least 75% of your bite which means you're mainly eating bread for your sandwich. The dirty sauce tastes like a modified thousand's island dressing and unfortunately if you order online (to avoid the ridiculous wait), it means you'll be greeted with a wet, limp sandwich. In the end, even though I knew my sandwich was supposed to consist of halal chicken, honey mustard, honey, bbq sauce, and three types of cheese, it ended up tasting like soggy bread with bbq chicken flavoring. Ask yourself this - would you pay $13 for soggy bbq chicken flavored bread?
The only Manage Trois I'll every have.Halal chicken with dirty sauce (sweet).I usually only eat half the sandwich and split or save the other half.Halal chicken only. Long lines, no place to sit but a great place to grab your sandwich and go.Street parking.Bottle soda collection and chips available.
This was my first Ike's experience. Joe was manning the register and was super helpful when I said it was my first time and that it was my birthday. He dialed me into the mnage a trois sandwich with a havarti substitution for the pepper jack. He also gave me chips to complement the sandwich. Loved the chips. Liked the sandwich. I couldn't taste the havarti and I wasn't all that keen on the texture of the chicken but I did like that the honey didn't make the sandwich too sweet.It's a short walk to Dolores Park so I ate my lunch with a great view -before the rain started falling again. All in all, a good experience but I'm not sure I will mAke it a lunch destination again.
Bruhhh. Ike.... You da man. I've only tried this place once, but this one time was a little taste of heaven. The menu has so many options; literally took my friend and me the entire wait in line (at least 30 min) to decide what to get. By the time I got to the front of the line, we ordered something that wasn't even on the menu we were checking online, but we ordered some random sign on the wall- a bear hug. Sorry I forgot what was in it, but you just gotta take a look around for yourself! The downside is the circling around for parking, long wait, and no indoor seating. But the sandwiches are worth it all. Plus it's a short walk to Dolores Park, so you can just chill and eat there and people watch :)
Hype or nah? Nah!Sandwiches: Spiffy Tiffy on Dutch Crunch. Go Dutch or go home. Literally had no idea dutch crunch was created in the Bay Area. So that's why, I'm honing this ideal through my review. Spiffy Tiffy comes with all of my favorite ingredients: pesto, fresh avocado, halal chicken, sauteed mushrooms, pepper jack & provolone... all that cheese, clearly it's gonna' be a melt-in-your-mouth type of sammie. So palatable. My boyfie always gets something different and he's never had any complaints. However, my only complaint is that although the bread is hard, they really pack the ingredients and my sandwich tends to get super soggy from the sauces... makes it a little hard to eat. Get those napkins ready.Service: Though the lines are long, the staff is very efficient and orderly. Quick service.Ambiance: Very small shop, simplistic and hip at the same time.Price: I pay about $12 for the sandwich, but they mostly range from about $10 - $13. Just wish they were a bit cheaper.Overall: High quality & tasty sandwiches. Definitely a bay area novelty, but I ain't complaining.
I came with a group of 8 before noon. Thank goodness we beat the rush because this place gets packed like crazy. It's a small place too.I tried the Menage a Trios and the Spiffy Tiffy. I really enjoyed the Spiffy Tiffy. There's a lot of flavors going on in that sandwich. On the other hand, the Menage a Trios was okay. I think there's like fried chicken in there. It was good, but it felt more on the mediocre side. Overall, really enjoyed my sandwiches and liked the variety of sandwiches they have.
After a long time waiting I finally made it to this spot... just to wait more time. When I walked inside, the place was crowded, but I would have never thought I would have had to wait an hour and 15 minutes to get a f...ing sandwich. NEVER AGAIN. Their menage a trois on dutch crunch bread was ok, but it wasn't worth the huge hassle to get it. 1) Rude bearded guy at the cashier.2) False signs advertising a discount with kash all over the room; instead the dude informs us that their "computers are not working"... really?! They didn't seem to have any trouble charging my credit card on their screen...3) I was told there would be a 30-minute wait... instead it was 1 hour and 15 minutes. The "service" is painfully slow, but the worse thing is that they are misleading. If I had known there was such a long wait, I would have left. Several customers felt the same. We were simply lied to. It's unacceptable. 4) Their products are largely overpriced. I feel like they keep lying to you to charge you right away and make you wait forever. They are beyond greedy, and no more offer complementary chips on weekends. Come here, if you love wasting your time and give money to arrogant people. Y-Ike's!! :-(
We came in about 30 min before they closed and the line was still fairly long but we didn't have to wait super long to place our order. This was my first time coming to Ike's but my brother has been raving about it ever since he tried it at the Stanford location which apparently closed down. We ordered the mnage a trois and the Matt Cain both on Dutch crunch. Apparently they came with a bag of chips too which was nice. My brother also got a bottled drink called Leninade which was like an orange soda but slightly different. Definitely recommend trying it! The only downside was that we had to wait a fairly long time to get our sandwiches, which sort of explains why there were so many ppl waiting inside when we walked in. Most ppl seemed to have ordered ahead and gone straight to the pick up register. I recommend doing that to avoid the long long wait. Once we got our sandwiches, I had to try it immediately. The mnage a trois was delicious!! The bbq sauce was kind of on the sweeter side. I would've preferred a slightly less of the sauce but the Dutch crunch bread was amazing! Definitely made the sandwich way better!
Should I really add the 6841st review? Well, I shall, because I really like what they do here at Ike's.I first heard about them when I had just left San Francisco to start school in London. Back then, I would read articles about this new sandwich place in my old neighborhood that caused the nearby resident's so much trouble because the line would always be way to looooooong. And in fact, I wouldn't get to have my first Ike's sandwich until I moved back to the Bay Area years later.Now, however, I'm an Ike convert. Of course, the sandwiches are tasty and huge (I recommend sharing for all my European friends ;-) But I especially like the vibe at this place. In fact it reminds me of the old San Francisco where you didn't have to create the shabby-chick look, but your place would actually be kind of dumpy. And that's the case with Ike's: it's somwhat dodgy - to use a term that the Brits would use. But it's fun - the crowd is cool and the people who work there are fun and energetic. Note: this is not a sit-down place. You order your sandwich and you leave the shop and then head to a nearby park!
Just waited an hour for my sandwich on 16th st. only to get home and realize I didn't get the avocado I paid extra for and my girlfriend didn't get her jalapeos. Whats happening to Ike's???Tried to contact the store and the phone is disconnected. They should take a note out of Chipotle's book and make a food line too. 1 hour for sandwiches that were not even heated up? Give me a break
What the hell! This place is delicious. A friend recommended I check them out while in San Francisco for my first time, and I am so happy I did! I went with two vegan friends who were happy with all of their options! I went early to avoid the line. The guy at the register had a huge beard and a friendly disposition. He was like a bear, a sandwich toting bear. He offered tons of suggestions. He helped me get the appropriate sandwich and sauce. Woo! Sandwich bear! I got the menage tois. The Dutch crunch was delicious. The meat was good, the size of the sandwich was good. And it wasn't too spendy! I've seriously dreamt about these sandwiches since a coming back home. A SF MUST!!!
It's so good. I wish there was one in Houston, TX! In the River Oaks Area to be the best location. I would eat there all the time if it was here. I was there for a school trip and I'm happy I found it
Damn good sandwich. I got the Mike Cain on Dutch Crutch! They have a board full of options but there is another menu online with a LOT more choices. It's hard to pick one, but I'm sure you can't go wrong!! Get there early before the crowd gets there. Short walk to Dolores Park!
Definitely a fan!I had never had Ike's before but heard they are delicious, messy sandwiches. Ike's has a very long list of sandwiches you can order on a couple types of bread. My BF told me their dutch crunch bread is amazing, so we got two sandwiches on it. Indeed, it was great bread for these hefty sandwiches!We got a Damon Bruce and an Adam Richman, just based on the descriptions. I wish I had Yelped beforehand so I could try the raved-about Menage a Trois and/or Spiffy Tiffy as well. I will get those next time around! The two that we selected were both great, but I personally liked the Adam Richman better. The menu says it has: Avocado, Fried Chicken, Ham, Pesto, Real Honey, Swiss in it. The Damon Bruce had Onion Rings, Provolone, Steak Sauce, Thinly-Sliced Rib Eye Steak. I'd say it was rather delicious as well, but the first sandwich had a more powerful kick to it, in terms of flavor, while the Damon Bruce was more mellow. The prices are a little high at about $10-13 per regular-sized sandwich. It seems that they have gargantuan sandwiches that I am curious about, but may need to split with a third eater if so! Lastly, I'm not sure I could wait more than 20 mins for a sandwich and it sounds as if you could wait for up to an hour. We had gotten lucky to park in a spot right out front and only wait about 15 mins for ours at around 3 PM.
Good sandwiches. They literally have never had their s--t together though. I've ordered on THEIR app now twice and they still can't manage it. This last time I showed up 30 minutes after ordering and they said they still needed 10 minutes! 40 minutes for a sandwich pickup!They also clearly have 10 or more people in the back making them which means operationally they have no clue.
TELL ALL YOUR FRIENDS! No, but seriously. This sandwich shop is too legit to quit. As an 18 year vegetarian, I feel like I've found my Dutch crunch nestled heaven. The Tom Brady was nothing short of amazing and so hearty I felt like I was carrying a baby in my bag. The garlic/herb sauce made everything. Pro tip: take IKE's to Delores for the best location to food ratio of your life
If Im around the neighborhood, I'd gladly line up for Ike's. WARNING: Their dutch crunch bread is.to.die.for. The texture, the taste.. is oh so yummy.What I get every time I go to an Ike's is the Matt Cain. I don't know much about baseball, but this sandwich called by his name is the best sandwich combo I've ever had. After the first bite of my sandwich, something hit me-the taste was so familiar, nostalgic. That's when I realized that this tasted like Doritos to me. I don't know if there are any other Matt Cain sandwich lovers out there, but that's what it tastes like to me strangely, Doritos. This 11.11$ (I had to google how much it cost) sandwich filled with godfather sauce, provolone, roast beef, salami, turkey, lettuce, & tomatoes is so pleasing and puts my stomach at ease. In the past, maybe like 1-2 yrs ago, they had a deal where if you paid cash, you could get a free refreshment and chips. This was when the Matt Cain was $9.99. Now, prices for their sandwiches have gone up, and the deal has been taken away. They just give you a caramel apple lollipop or a generic mass produced lollipop from Costco (lol). I would recommend going to the Ike's either at SFSU or the Castro. I'm not a big fan of the Serramonte, Daly City location for I feel that they skimp on the ingredients and are out of things faster. For example, my mom went to the Serramonte location to buy a sandwich, and they told her they were out of Belly (rewards cards/stamp cards) AND caramel apple lollipops. Overall, their sandwiches are addicting, but for the price ehh.
Ike's used to be my favorite sandwich shop in the city. They opened my eyes to what a gourmet sandwich could be with their creative combinations and extensive menu. I will always have fond memories of enjoying an iced cold ginger beer, kettle chips, and Matt Cain's and Menage a Trois sammies in the sun at Dolores Park on a Sunday afternoon. Unfortunately, the last two times I've been here, the quality has gone down significantly. I waited over an hour for my sandwiches, which by foodie standards is acceptable, but they weren't even that good! I ordered two sandwiches: my classic Manage a Trois with honey mustard bbq halal chicken and pepper jack/swiss cheese, and the Joker with beef meatballs, beer battered fried zucchini, and red pesto. They were both a mess. My dutch crunch bread was soggy, the chicken was mushy, and the flavors were muddled. The joker didn't fare much better with cold meatballs and mushy fried zucchini. The sandwiches tasted like they had been sitting on the counter for half an hour.Service is always upbeat and friendly, but they're so SLOW and understaffed. If you have a line out the door, you need more than one person on register. They also don't include a bag of chips with your order like they used to. Ike's continues to expand throughout the Bay Area, recently adding "Ike's Love and Sandwiches" to Serramonte shopping mall in Daly City, but that location skimped on ingredients and the sandwiches just weren't the same. I've held on to my memories and my hope for what Ike's once was - the best place to get a sandwich - but their popularity has gotten to their heads. An hour+ wait and almost $30 for two sammies and chips? With better options available in SF that are more affordable and have better quality, I can't justify a visit here. My 5 star memories are now a 3. Don't get me wrong, the sandwiches are still...good, but not worth it anymore. I rather go to Lou's.
I was in town for a few days and had to stop by here based on the fantastic Yelp reviews! The place is a small order and go restaurant. They have a large selection of sandwiches and mostly with non pork items (except the bacon) which made me super excited bc I could get anything on the menu! I ordered the roast beef which came with the beef salami and I came in during happy hour so was able to get chips and a drink on the house. The customer service here is beyond top notch. We had a full on conversation about the food, Ike, and the future of the business and it was such a pleasant discussion.We ordered the Manage Trois and the Matt Cain. Both were so different and phenomenal in their own way. Absolutely delish, and I can easily say the best sandwiches i have ever had. I cannot wait to come back! You MUST try them!
Probably the best sandwich shop I've been to in some time, maybe in all time! This place is very laid back and has many different sandwiches to offer. They have a good selection of halal sandwiches that I thought was cool. I ordered the Julius Caesar Sandwich on their world's famous Dutch Crunch Bread and it was delicious! They have no sitting area to eat, only a couple of benches by the window so take it to go if you can. Now that I know that this place exists, I will never go anywhere else for a sub in the San Francisco area.
The sandwiches are SO good. I decided to make Ike's my first meal with chicken (!!) in over 4 years, and boy, was it worth it. I ordered the Menage A Trois, which is probably the most hyped sandwich, and for good reason. It was delicious. The chicken was cooked perfectly and shredded in a way that was perfectly moist. The combination of sauces made the sandwich, for sure. Oh and the bread. The bread was so tasty by itself, and combined with the filling of the sandwich, everything just meshed together to perfection. Portion sizes are huge as well, so I saved half of the sandwich for lunch the next day (it was a little soggy in some places but still tasted very good as leftovers go!)My biggest complaint has to do with the wait. My friends and I got to Ike's at 1:10pm on a Sunday afternoon, and from waiting in line to waiting for our food, we didn't leave the store until 2:30pm. Absolutely ridiculous. I was already hungry while I was waiting in line, and by the time I got my sandwich, I was voracious. It doesn't help that there isn't much seating inside or outside of the store (and most of the seating was taken up by people who were waiting for their food...), so we had to walk a little bit to Dolores Park to eat. Not complaining about eating at the park, but gee, it took almost 1hr45min to actually start eating my food. Not the best of experiences.I would highly recommend ordering by phone and picking up in the store so that you're not just chilling in a cramped space for too long.Not sure if I think waiting this long in line is worth it... but the sandwich sure was good!
I've been hearing great things about Ike's for the past three years but I've never actually made my way out to it. I gave myself plenty of excuses. "It won't be as good as they say it is". "The line is too long". "I'm not a sandwich guy". As it turns out, it is as good as they say. You can find times of day when the line isn't too long. And I can mostly definitely be a sandwich guy given the right sandwich. The plan was to grab lunch with a friend at Curry Up Now, but it was closed and he knew I had never been to Ike's so my friend convinced me to give it a try. I was in the mood for some meatballs and Ike's had just the sandwich- the Mario. My friend got himself a reuben and we split the sandwiches so we each got half. The Mario was great! Substantial meatballs coated in delicious sauce. The reuben was good but not very memorable. It's pretty understandable why Ike's is such an SF staple. It's got a large selection of delicious sandwiches, it's located in trendy Mission, and their sandwiches have the coolest names ever.
Came here right when they opened and was the second one to order. Decided to get the Super Mario, which was quite tasty. Basically there's no seating, so go out and find a spot to devour your sandwich. Prices are a little high (even for SF) and service could be friendlier, but it was still a damn good sandwich.
Read the website before coming.Only 1 person at register so line longer than needed to be.No where to sit.Customer Service was non existent. They weren't rude just couldn't care if we were there.Forgot our chips so we had to go back.It is dirty but I think that's to be expected???Got the Super Mario it was good. My husband got the Matt Cain he said it was it was good as well.2 sandwiches 2 bags of chips30.00
Incredible. The best sandwiches I've ever had! It's a tiny shop, and about a fifteen minute wait to get your sandwich. But do it...it's worth it! They have a million great options, but I'm a fan of the Matt Cain on french. And there's an app, so you can even order online!
I tried the Menage A Trois. It's a good sandwich; nothing special. I definitely would not wait in line for it.
It's a trap.So much hype around this place and my experience was below par. One star for the cashier pleasantries. Kudos to them for dealing with a butt ton of people every day... many of the customers likely irritated by the long waits. My boyfriend brought me to try it out for the first time. People rave about Ike's left, right, up, and down the Bay. Note to all and future me: order online or for pick-up 2 hours in advanced.THE WAIT: It was 45-minute wait just to order and 1-hour-15-minute wait to get our sandwiches. In no universe is it okay to spend 2 hours just to get a sandwich. With the crowds being typically this huge, they need a better system. Okay, fine, the wait is part of the Ike's experience but 2. Fucking. Hours. Never going this location again. I could have driven to the Stanford Ike's, ordered, eaten, and returned to SF in that time.SANDWICHES:- mnage a tois with Dutch crunch = very saucy and messy. I chose it because it seemed popular. It was an okay sandwich but not worth 2 hours. Very flavorful with BBQ sauce but I think the other components got lost in the BBQ-ness. I couldn't taste the cheeses or other parts of the sandwich. I guess the sauciness also made the Dutch crunch not so crunchy.- Robin Williams on sourdough = much less messy. Nice lighter flavor than the mnage a tois.- Our sandwiches were cold for being "hot sandwiches." This was likely due to them sitting on the kitchen counter open faced for over 30 minutes. The customers before us got their sandwiches waaaaay before we did and the kitchen had hella sandwiches lined up open faced on their counter. Meh.Customers get caramel apple suckers with their sandwiches. Suckers for us suckers...
Dr. Swirlz was super friendly, dancey, energetic, and funny while he was helping us at the cash register. The song "E.T." came on and he started jamming along with his other coworkers. I definitely got the good vibes and high energy from him.As for the food, we got the Robin Williams and Lil Mermaid. Robin Williams was great, but oh my goodness - everyone has to try the Lil Mermaid. The flavor is very unique and unexpected. I'd give it over 5 stars if I could.
If you're into sandwiches and you're in SF then you should definitely make sure to drop by Ike's Place. The only problem is that choosing which sandwich to go for is typically an hour long process of indecisiveness for me... So make sure you start early!This time around, I had the Madison Bumgarner (which was excellent), my friends got the Menage A Trois, and Pastrami-Charmed Life. We all went for the Dutch Crunch Bread.Highly recommended, albeit expensive and generally a long wait (but you can order online for pickup).
I will be back and I will order the Sabercat. If you do not order the Sabercat you will live a life full of regrets especially if one day you taste and realize that could have been you enjoying that sandwich but instead you choose something else. I ordered the Castro and it was delicious. My best friend ordered the Thanksgiving sandwich with cranberry sauce. That was a party in my mouth. Her boyfriend had the Sabercat and my life will never be the same.  I now must live with this regret. This place is pretty chill. They don't have tables but they do have a bench that wraps around. They had a plug and I plugged my phone. Thanks! I needed to catch a flight and the sandwich and electricity hit the spot. The guy told us they have more sandwich selections that what is on the board. I didn't ask him where I could find all those selections.  I should have.
While on vacation in San Francisco this was one of the places I wanted to eat at. Me and my girlfriend came here for lunch on a weekend, and lone and behold Ike himself was there too!The sandwiches tasted great. Better than your average Subway, Togos, or Jersey Mikes, and at the same price margin as well. We both enjoyed our sandwiches and the Dutch Crunch bread is a definite must!
Waited 45minutes for two sandwiches. Might be better not to keep the kitchen door open where everyone can see how slow they are working back there. So slow... If they would chat less and just make sandwiches... The entire place was literally shoulder-to-shoulder and a line outside the door. Kinda ridiculous for sandwiches... I had the Mnage a trois with Dutch bread. It was okay, but not worth the wait, especially for an overpriced sandwich. Would not come back again or recommend.
How can i skip the opportunity to try a place that has over 6000 reviews on yelp!?! I came here on a saturday afternoon and the line was already out the door. The place has no tables so it is more of a grab and go kind of place. After a long debate over what to get, I ended up getting the Menage a Trois sandwich which was about $13. Pretty expensive for a sandwich tbh. They ask you what bread you want but I honestly had no clue what would go with it so i just had them recommend me one. The staff is really helpful in explaining what goes well with what sandwich. It comes with halal chicken, bbq, cheddar, honey mustard, pepper jack, real honey, Swiss. The wait for the sandwich took about 20 minutes which is pretty long for a sandwich but understandable because of how long the line was. The sandwich is HUGEEE. omg i did not expect that. I was barely able to finish the first half of the sandwich. The Menage a Trois was goood though. Definitely get a lot of napkins as it will definitely get messy. The meat was good and comes with its own sauce and goes well with the sweet bbq in it. The sandwich was good but I dont think I would wait 20 minutes for it again.They also give every order a caramel apple lollipop!
I want to marry a sandwich and I'm not afraid to admit it! Best sandwiches in San Francisco!!!! Came here and ordered the Minage a trios with pickles on the crunch bread. It was hands down one of the best sandwiches I've ever had and because we came here around 2:30-3 it was "happy hour" and we got a free soda/ water AND packet of chips. WINNING!
Thank you Ike's for my sammie and lollipop! I had not intended to eat this place but stumbled here (literally lol). Food alone exceeded my expectation. I am not a sammie woman, but I've seen them on the Travel Channel. So of course, I had to try this place out. I will definitely come back if I am in the area. Although, make sure you have a lot of patience to wait. It does take awhile to get your order made.
My friends recommend this place while out for work in SF. I was blown away at the selection and quality of the sandwiches, my friends grabbed and decided to try the Tony Stark and wow.Definitely coming back, and there is a bigger menu you can find online with some tasty sounding subs. The only downside to this place is that is tiny so there really isn't a place to sit and eat on a busy day.
A San Francisco staple! Everyone has to try Ikes Place for sandwiches. Over 200 + to try! Food named after celebs and athletes. Everyone has to go to Ikes!!
Seriously this place is so good! We got lucky and got parking right in front a few minutes before they were supposed to close. There was no line but a few people waiting for their orders. We got the mnage a trois and it was out of this world! I can't wait to go back and try something different the next time I'm in San Francisco!
This place lives up to its hype, it's delicious! And I'm not even a huge sandwich fan. The menu is ridiculous and they have WAY more selections than the ones written on the board. Go on their website to look at all of them. But I suggest you don't if you are indecisive like me because it just made the decision that much harder. We ended up getting two popular choices: mnage a trois and spiffy tiffy. Both were great! The sandwiches are huge and I had the other half of mine for dinner. Came here on Labor Day around 11 30 and there was no line! But the line started getting really long around noon. Bring your sandwich to delores and enjoy the sun and sandwich!
Oh man... I am so glad I got to try this place on my short visit from NYC.Let's start by saying, the sandwiches are HUGE.Definitely good to share if you don't eat a lot.I got the spiffy tiffy and the quality of all the ingredients can certainly be tasted. I kind've felt like I was having a exquisite italian pasta dish in the sandwich.The BREAD was what topped everything off.We got the Dutch bread which is highly recommended and that was probably the best decision I've made in a while.I would love to come back to try the other sandwiches!Definitely stop by...Tip: There are two separate waits (a line to order and a line for picking up the order)There were some people who pre-ordered the sandwich on some sort of app so you should do that if you want to minimize your wait time!
I've been a loyal fan of Ike's for years, and their sandwiches always do their thing!A few thing: expect a wait, for sure. Yes, they're incredibly popular and insanely busy most times you ever pop by. So a long wait for a sandwich? I'll let it slide. However, sometimes I've been here with maybe 4 other customers in the store but the sandwich still took 15-20 minutes to come out.That being said, Ike's has got some amazing sandwiches on the menu that keeps me coming back. Some of my personal favorites are the Matt Cain, Stephan Jenkins and the Pastrami-Charmed Life. I always get them on Dutch Crunch with some extra dirty sauce.The portions are HUGE so make sure you come hungry; I love grabbing a sandwich at Ike's, heading over to Philz for an iced coffee and parking it at Dolores Park for a killer view. ;)
What a menu. Inside the restaurant, there's only a handful of items were listed although they do have more items. You can order any sandwich you find on their website even if it's not on the menu board. I found any of the sandwiches with halal chicken were really good. One of my favorites is the Robin Williams. The others ones are good too. The dutch crunch is highly recommended unless you really wanted another type bread. The sandwich is quite filling and juicy, packed with flavors. We came when it wasn't too busy but it got really busy once we left with our food.
So obsessed with these sandwiches. They jusy opened one in SD too! Trying every sandwich on the menu is my goal. Also you get a free lollipop. The staff is also super nice. I kinda wish there was space to sit down and eat but not really a deal breaker or anything.
You cannot leave SF without trying Ike's. Yes, they recently brought an Ike's in LA in Westwood, but SF is the OG. The Menage A Trois is absolutely mouth watering and delicious. I'm sure all their other sandwiches are bomb too, but ya gotta try the Menage A Trois!!! $11.11, it's pretty big and very filling. I shared with a friend and we were both content after a half of a sandwich :)
Me: "I'm going to get the vegetarian sandwich."Everyone's first reaction: "Are you a vegetarian??!"Me: "No, I just like vegetarian things sometimes."Everyone: ".........."However I never have to explain myself at Ike's, because I get the "Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian" sandwich.Ike's sandos are the best and the worst because they are delicious and portions are huge, so you are tempted to finish one even though you know you shouldn't. (It's easy to use the excuse that leftovers would be too soggy). That is why my go-to is the Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian on whole wheat bread, because 1) I can pretend to be healthy, 2) I can finish my sandwich without feeling like a fatty (provided I have a small breakfast and dinner), and 3) I don't sink into a massive hopeless food coma afterwards.Their menu is even bigger than the sandwiches... I believe their secret menu totals to over a hundred, with delicious combinations of anything from traditional sandwich meats to dirty sauce and wasabi mayo to onion rings. In a sandwich. (!!) The only downside, besides the portion size/tastiness dilemma, is that this location has extremely limited seating. In spirit of SF irony, they use up all the extra space as a seating area for waiting as they make your sandwich, but there is only a tiny bench outside for eating.Tip: The infamous Superman includes a glorious selection of sando fillings (it's so stuffed that I have to take separate bites for the top half and the bottom half), but it's $23 and comes as 2 whole separate sandwiches...... SF has a strange sense of humor.
Heard so many great things about this place and I just had to stop by to try it. Definitely did not disappoint! Luckily there was no line when I went on a weekday around 4:30pm. If you're going on a weekend, make sure to phone-in an order before going!Parking & Service- Street parking as always, probably the worst thing about this place. I couldn't find parking for the longest time..- Friendly staff!Food:- Spiffy Tiffy $13 (with dutch crunch bread)Heard there were over a hundred of sandwiches on their secret menu, but I was sold once I saw that it had avocado and pesto. Sandwich consists of Avocado, Halal Chicken, Mushroom, Pepper Jack, Pesto, Provolone. I highly recommend this! I shared half with my boyfriend, which was a great size to keep me full. The price was expensive, but it's not too bad if you're sharing!- They also give you caramel apple pops with each order. They told me to let them know that we're sharing so they can give us two pops, but they only gave us one even though we told them.Happy hour! - From 3-6pm weekdays- Free chips and drink of your choice. Definitely get the Voodoo Heat flavor if you like a mixture of spicy, sweet, and sour.
I saw Ike's Place featured on "Man vs. Food" when Adam went to San Francisco. When I saw the variety of sandwiches on the show, I was impressed. But when I saw the behemoth sandwich the "Kryptonite", I knew I had to go there before I died.As for the sandwich .... it was HUGE & it was DELICIOUS. It was messy. It was an experience. The first half fed me & my wife for dinner. the second half fed me for lunch & dinner the next day. I don't know what they put in the dirty sauce, but my heart literally stopped for a few beats within the first few bites. The sourdough bread I had was not only soft and chewy it was oh so fresh. I bake my own bread at home, and I wished I could make bread as good as what they do at Ike's.For anyone visiting San Francisco, DO NOT leave the city without eating a sandwich here. You won't regret it.
I had the Pee Wee sandwich. It was super good! But I'm giving Ike's 4stars because I had never been here before and when I asked the girl at the front for recommendations she was very cold and abrupt, she just told me the numbers of the sandwiches and said, "those are all favorites". She didn't even ask me about sides or tell me about anything else I could try and get. I totally would've gotten more food and maybe some sides if I knew they had them while I was ordering. Just a bummer cuz I walked for about and hour to only get sandwich and a small bag of chips..
One of the best sandwiches I've ever had! The Dutch Crunch Bread was exciting enough, but the sandwiches are just so well done! The Stephan Jenkins was amazing! I don't think you could go wrong with any of the sandwiches on the menu, especially since there's about 100 to choose from!The only downside was the lack of seating inside but it gave us a reason to take our sandwiches and hang out for the day at Dolores Park.
This was highly recommended by a friend. I don't like sandwiches but Ike's sandwiches were so delicious, so messy but flavorful and huge! The best sandwich I've had. We ordered the menage a trois on their famous Dutch Crunch Bread. It goes with halal chicken, cheddar cheese, Bbq, honey mustard, pepper jack, real honey and swiss. I love the dirty sauce that makes their sandwiches mouthwatering.Cons:-limited seating and no tables-parking is a hassle-$13 is quite expensive for a sandwich but the portion was hugeNote: Order online for pick-up to avoid long lines. Definitely a must if you're in the city.
I am sorry to say that Ike's is overhyped. The Menage A Trois was indeed delicious and I highly recommend it. However, it was very small and I wasn't full after spending $12.21 on it. That's an expensive sandwich to not be full off of. I'm very confused by reviews saying the regular sandwiches are big enough to split. Are these reviews left by children?My boyfriend got the Kryptonite. Now THAT was a sandwich you can share and at a whopping $26.62, it better be shareable. This sandwich had the opposite problem of my Menage A Trois. It had plenty of quantity but not plenty of quality. It felt like it was created purely for novelty and not actual taste. The fried elements (jalapeno poppers, onion rings, etc) were soggy. And overall, all the elements just didn't come together the way they deliciously did for the Menage. I feel like the goldilocks of sandwiches. One was tasty but too small and the other was huge and not tasty. Pretty disappointing, as I went in expecting to love this place. Customer service was very nice though!
I don't have kids, but if I had a daughter there's one lesson that'd be high on my priorities to teach her and that's that there's no Prince Charming. It doesn't matter how pretty, smart, or kind you are, fairy tales are phony bologna (or faux bacon, in this scenario) and in the end you can only depend on yourself because men are about as unreliable as they come... unless we're talking Ike, in which case you can count him for what's most important in life: Sandwiches. I came here on a Sunday afternoon and got lucky that there was zero wait and my sandwich seemed extra stuffed, just the way I like it. Sure, my sandwich, huckleberry soda, and chips were $23, but it was worth every red cent and topped off with the classic caramel apple sucker. I always get the Purple Bee sandwich. It's often not on their menu board, but so far I've never had a problem getting them to whip it up with all that vegetarian bacon, creamy avocado, sub gouda cheese and on their wheat bread with those tasty little oat pieces baked in. Just perfect and probably enough for two meals for a normal person but I'm a strong-ass woman who likes to eat so I always finish my Ike's in full- no no-good man shall lay a finger on my leftovers.
A now growing chain, we hit the San Francisco Original Ike's, and in fact served by Ike himself. Ike's has an abundance of sandwiches. I've ordered two and tasted from friends. All great. Their 'Dirty Sauce' is SO Tasty!! Grab a sandwich and head to Mission Dolores Park to get all your senses adjusted...
Time and Day Visited: A Tuesday at 4:30 PMTotal Spent: $13.95What can I say that hasn't already been said? This was my first meal as a tourist in San Francisco, and it stands out as one of my favourites. We came here on a weekday late afternoon, and while we feared there would be lineups, it wasn't busy at all! We ordered one Menage a Trois on Dutch Crunch bread to share, and because it was happy hour, we were given a bag of Voodoo chips (a fusion salt & vinegar and bbq flavour) and a bottle of water.While the service is nothing to write home about, the sandwich itself is what dreams are made of, and I've never had one like it! The bread was light and soft, and the dirty sauce fused with the chicken gave the sandwich a burst of flavour. It was was the perfect combination, and the epitome of what the perfect sandwich should be. Whether you're a tourist in SF or not, visit Ike's when you can! It was a fantastic sandwich, and I will definitely come back when I'm in town again.
I love their secret sauce, but the sandwiches that I ordered this last time kept falling apart. Mind you, I'm a very clean eater. On the real. I use one napkin per meal unlike my girlfriend who uses 50. But for this meal, I used maybe 5 or 6 which means that my girlfriend used up every napkin in the restaurant, in my car, and in Costco's 674 warehouses. So yea...it tasted great but they need to take more care in making and wrapping "Menage Trois" and "Matt Cain".
I'm on a mission to check out all the Yelp top 100 spots. At #24 thought this was a good lunch choice. I had the #111 mnage a trios on wheat. It was also a bonus happy hour which is apparently Monday-Thursday 3-6pm so got a free drink and bag of chips. The sandwich was delicious, flavors were amazing. It was a little smaller than the pics I had seen posted but overall yum yum. The space itself is a walk up and take out space. There's no tables, just a few benches while you wait for your order. A bit dirty but loved the vibe and service was great. I'd definitely go back and try a thanksgiving day sandie!!
Amazing sandwich shop located in Castro, SF filled with the friendliest staff!!Came here on a sunny afternoon around 1p.m. with my girlfriends and I to see what all the hype was about and boy was I NOT disappointed. I ordered the:Menage A Trois: I ordered this sandwich with the famous original crunchy bread with free additional jalapeos in a to-go bag. Total came out to be around $13 something. When I received my to-go bag, I was happy to see that the staff tossed in a sour green caramel apple lollipop! The sauce was sweet and the bread was crunchy on the outside, but soft and juicy on the inside. This was definitely a savory sandwich. I'd rate it a 9 out of 10. What which make it perfect is if it had avocado in it but I'm not complaining. I'm usually not wowed much by sandwiches because most of the time, I feel as though I could make it myself. But this place makes sandwiches that even if I googled the recipe, it wouldn't compare.Parking: My friends and I easily found free street parking right across the street. Service: Extremely nice and helpful staff
Tried We're just friends. It's great! Tastes clean and tasty. The famous crunchy bread is juicy and soft on one side, which I really liked. They were really generous with their ingredients!
It's a sandwich joint with too many choices and just all over the place as far as selections and menu. We tried both "the forty" and the "mnage a troi". Both the fianc and I would order the forty again with dirty sauce but the mnage a troi was too sweet with all the BBQ and honey. The only thing about that sandwich that was superb was the halal chicken. I'd eat that all day. I would suggest sticking with something super basic and adding your own extras and condiments from there. As far as the atmosphere, there is none. Pretty slow and weird but if your into the sandwiches, it won't matter. Don't try and eat there, only order to go. Also, if you are like me and hate waiting, call in for pick up and you won't be bummed about about long waits and slow service like other yelpers.
Had the XXXtina. Was good, but I'd do without the veggie breaded chicken. Otherwise, so damn good.Couple days later I decided to try the veggie breaded eggplant sammie. Fried, aye. Too rich, made me sick to my stomach.
We went on a Sunday morning and there was no line! Score! We ordered the The Damon Bruce sandwich which consist of Beer Battered Onion Rings, Provolone, Steak Sauce and thinly sliced rib eye on the Dutch bread. They also have French, sour dough and whole wheat as an option. The sandwich overall was pretty tasty! The combination of the meat and the sauce on fresh bread is what made the sandwich delicious. We added pepperchini, pickles and jalapeos with no added cost. I would recommend this one, however it is a little bit more pricier than the other sandwiches. A star is marked off because it took a while for the sandwich to be made. There was only one or two other person in the shop waiting for their sandwich so I wasn't sure what took so long.
If only I knew what they put in their secret sauce! Dutch crunch is hands down my favorite bread option.Their bread to filling ratio works. Just enough filling for you to enjoy the sandwich from end to end.They need more seating area.
Heard so much about this place so while visiting we went out of our way to go here for lunch. We were not disappointed. Huge portions. I couldn't finish my wrap and kept half of it for dinner.
Was in town for a friend's wedding and I wasn't hungry and wanted something simple (joke's on me for picking this place). Given that my cousin who has lived in SF for 5 years have not yet tried this place, we came here. We made it just in time before it closes at 7pm. There was NO LINE! woohoo~ and after some (a lot) of slow reading of the massive menu, we chose Spiffy Tiffy and the Change. Spiffy Tiffy $12.21 - Avocado, Halal Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepper Jack, Pesto, ProvoloneChange $11.11 - BBQ, Beer Battered Onion Rings, Gouda, thinly sliced rib eyeWe took it home to eat since they were going to close soon and I needed time to get hungry. The sandwiches were very heavy and big. The cuz and I swapped half of our sandwiches so we can try both. They were really good! I loved the avocado and mushroom and pesto and chicken - uhm basically everything about the sandwich. I saved my half of the Change for next day lunch and by the time I had got to it, the beer battered Onion Rings were in a sad state of soppy mess but the taste and flavor profile was great. One thing to note was that while we were eating our sandwiches after we got home, the "nom" sounds came out of our mouths after each bite. It was kind of funny b/c all conversation ceased as we worked on our sandwich. The price was high for sandwiches, but the size and the deliciousness of the sandwiches are worth the price in my opinion.
Foods great but the service is almost unbelievably slow. There couldn't have been more than 10 people ahead if us in line when I ordered but it took more than an hour to get my food. I couldn't figure out what the hell the employees were doing the whole time. No sandwich is worth that kind of wait.
This place isn't too bad actually, there's no seating on the inside except for waiting on your order. However, the Matt Cain and menage a trois were absolutely delicious on their famous bread. The amount of honey mustard and halal chicken were portioned perfectly inside the bread on the menage a trois! Certain toppings come free on your sandwich by request like red onions, banana peppers, and pickles. Premium toppings like cucumber and avocado are around $1 to $2 to add onto your sandwich. The price of each sandwich was around $12 each, but what makes this place truly unique is their "dirty" sauce which is added to each of their sandwiches. It's extremely creamy and sort of reminds me of Big Mac sauce except much smoother. Just as any other place in San Francisco, it may be a bit hard to find, but it's definitely worth stopping by if you're ever in the city.
Hidden gem! Hole in the wall. BUT THE BEST SANDWICH IVE EVER HAD. Hands down. Amazing hard working employees. Bless up. Over and out.
No one should ever have to live life without having had an Ike's sub. The hype is justified. Always order the Dutch Crunch bread-- it's perfect. The people are great, the food has character and I've never tried a sub I haven't loved. My current favorite is the Hot Momma.
I came to Ike's on a Saturday morning around 1030am. I thought if there's a line out the door, I won't try to find parking. Low and behold I pull up to Ike's and there is 1) no line out the door and 2) a parking spot right up front. The parking and food gods were shining on me that morning. I have gone to the location in Walnut Creek and tried the Back Stabber, which is phenomenal, so I wanted to go for something a bit more spicy this second time around. So why not try the Castro exclusive Will the Thrill. Every bite was an enjoyable spiciness and the dirty sauce complimented the hot link very well. I only wished that the hot link was spicier. I do love me some spicy food so the hotter the better I say!If my luck with parking and the line comes around again, I'll definitely try another item on their menu.
I was on vacation in SF and I wanted to try all the best foods SF had to offer. I took uber here around 11am and there was zero people in line. I was surprised such a popular place would have zero people at 11am. I ordered Mnage a trois sandwich. Ike's is known for this special garlic sauce they put on all of their sandwiches. The sandwich was decent but I really didn't like their special sauce. Everyone else seems to love it, but just not for me.
Conveniently located a few blocks away from 16th and Mission BART Station and two blocks away from Dolores Park, Ike's is very popular spot to dine at in the city. The storefront is small, so when it's busy, the line goes out the door!Sandwiches are around $12, and there are a ton of options to chose from. - Menage A Trois: BBQ, Cheddar, Halal Chicken, Honey Mustard, Pepper Jack, Real Honey, Swiss- Matt Cain: Godfather Sauce, Provolone, Roast Beef, Salami, TurkeyBoth were delicious. They definitely don't skimp on the ingredients! Besides sandwiches, they also sell lemonade, soda, and water. The lemonade and soda bottles are not twist offs, but I'm sure you can find someone at Dolores Park with a bottle opener. ;)As of 03/26, this location is CASH ONLY!
I have countless caramel apple lollipops all over the apartment...enough said.Their sandwich selection is massive with tons of vegetarian/vegan options and the staff is always super friendly.Tip: best to order online and give it about an hour. Also order at non-peak times, and avoid at peak times
Ike's Place has some of the best sandwiches I have ever had! You really can't go wrong with whatever you get. Over the years I have been several times and there is always something new.
This is the greatest sandwich in the entire world. To be more specific: the Menage a Trois is the greatest sandwich in the entire world. Paired with the best chips in the entire world (Zapp's Voodoo Heat), and (arguably) the best city, lunch at Ike's is like taking a quick trip to heaven. What's the secret? It's the sauce. Honey mustard, BBQ, and the real star of the show, Ike's secret Dirty Sauce combine to create a magical, delicious explosion of saucy sandwich perfection. It melts into the crusty dutch crunch bread and creates true sandwich majesty. It's messy, it's drippy, and it's delicious, whether eaten right outside of the shop on the benches or taken up to the top of Twin Peaks and eaten with the best view of the city as your backdrop. I don't go to San Francisco often enough to stray from my tried and true, but from what I've gleaned stealing bites from other people's sammies, they're all as delicious as the Menage a Trois.
What can I say that hasn't already been said? This place was highly recommended with a staggering amount of reviews on Yelp, so when visiting SF, me and the GF made a stop here. Consensus: YUMMY!!! Some of the best sandwiches we've had, and I highly recommend. They have too many to try them all, but I hear they're all good!Featured on: Best Thing I Ever Ate, and Man VS Foodfoodnetwork.com/local/ca
Okay, so these sandwiches are good. Better than any chain sub shop by far. But I have definitely had better sub sandwiches.When I got to the shop, the line was out the door. Ended up waiting about 15 minutes to place an order and another 15 minutes to get my sandwiches. All sandwiches come with their dirty sauce and choice of bread. I tried the Matt Cain and the Damon Bruce, both on Dutch Crunch.The Damon Bruce is basically a cheese steak with steak sauce and onion rings. It was good, but really heavy on the sauces. The Matt Cain had Godfather Sauce, provolone, roast beef, salami, and turkey. It had a much better flavor, because it wasn't drowning in sauce.It's a bit expensive for what you're getting, I'd rather have a sub from one of NY/NJ's Italian delis.
The absolute best sandwich spot. It's saucy so you ask for less if you don't like it. Also most sandwiches come with a lot of ingredients so again if you don't like that choose accordingly. Otherwise, absolute deliciousness. Every single one is amazing. You must try them all :)If you like sandwiches flavourful style, this is your heaven on earth.
Really good crunchy Dutch bread and a sinful sandwich spread. I've only tried the BBQ chicken melt and it was very good but way too salty.Would definitely want to try other sandwiches here. Menu is too extensive, kind of annoying that there's almost too much to choose from here.
Awesome sandwiches for a great price. The wait may take a while as they're typically busy but it'll be worth it. Looking at premium quality sandwiches with decent prices? This is the place to stop by. Pick up sandwiches and go hang out at Dolores Park. It's pretty casual and if you're looking for a public bathroom, they do have one to offer unlike the lot of places close by
From my very first bite of Ike's iconic Bella sandwich (previously know as the Name of Girl I'm Dating), it became my favorite sandwich and Ike's became my holy grail sandwich shop. Nothing could separate me from the Bella when a craving struck - not long queues, not the distance, and certainly not the hype. With the most brilliant halal chicken ever put on two pieces of perfectly-baked Dutch bread, to the impossibly good honey mustard sauce, to the always ripe avocado and the zesty pepper jack cheese, this combination slayed. Oh how I miss that incarnation of the Bella. In the past year, however, the systems started showing their weaknesses. Calling ahead didn't help secure a faster transaction, and then last month an online order still kept us waiting for 45 minutes past the requested time. Again, the queues never really got to me but what changed was Ike's usually awesome customer service.During that 45-minute wait, I asked the cashier twice if our sandwiches were ready, and let him know we had placed the order online via their FB app. I received a terse reply, and was asked to step aside and wait. No problem; got it. After seeing many people leave with sandwiches they had ordered while in the store - I inquired about a particular bag that had been sitting for an extended period. The guy finally took me seriously and checked the contents of the bag - yep, it was our order. With two deflated, lukewarm sandwiches that he passed over without an apology.Me: "Have those been sitting there this entire time?"He: "I don't know."That's it? Really? Well, it gets worse. My friend and I make our way to Dolores Park, bit into our smushy, neglected sandwiches and we each find long curly hairs. In our sandwiches.Worth the wait? Not this time, and probably never again. Sorry Ike's - it was beautiful while it lasted and I'll choose to fondly remember the good times.
Got the little mermaid and honestly I wasn't too impressed. Apparently they have a huge menu? No one told us that though.. So we ordered off the menu on the wall! It's definitely a "to go" place and if you're visiting it's not really a must. But the staff was super friendly!
What can I say about this place?! The sandwiches are INCREDIBLE. It takes a little time but the line and the wait are both worth it once you're eating your sandwich!I got the Home for Thanksgiving with the Dutch Crunch bread and this just may have been the best sandwich I have ever eaten! And that means a lot coming from someone who loves sandwiches and would say a good sandwich is one of my favorite meals!!Tip: get the Dutch Crunch bread! It was really great bread - crunchy on the outside and perfectly soft in the middle.
Yeah these sandwiches are hella good. I got in line, thinking "hey, this isn't too bad, it's not out the door," unaware that some people had called in or ordered through their app thingermabobber. And lo and beyond, I waited maybe 45 minutes for my sandwich in a small little room with some other locals and hypebeast kids while random folks came in and picked up their sammiches. But when I bit into the sandwich on the crest of Dolores Park, I was on top of the world. I ordered the Sneaky Kitty with veggie bacon and it was deliciously crunchy and juicy. Their dutch crunch bread is really delicious -- I would recommend it. Something about Ike's is just really good.I saved the rest of my sandwich for dinner and walked all the way down to Mission and ate the sandwich after some rain had fell and the sandwich got soggy in its old brown bag. But was it still good? Hell yes. Would I wait 45 minutes again? Maybe, but I'd get out and take a walk first or call in. This place is crazy! Check out their online menu as well.
How do I even begin? I saw that Ike's Place had absurdly good reviews on Yelp so I decided to try it out for myself. We went in the morning, around 11, so there was no line. We ordered and our food was out within 10 minutes. The store itself is not very big, but still features a roomy bathroom that is painted bright orange and blue. The service was nothing special, but the sandwiches are the absolute highlight. The store is covered in stickers from who knows where, and the color scheme consists of bright hues of blue, orange, and green.We ordered the Peyton Manning (chicken, grilled mushrooms, cheddar, , bacon, avocado) and Paul Reuben (pastrami, poppy seed coleslaw, french dressing, swiss). The sandwiches are a bit pricey, ranging from about $7-$10. This is understandable because the ingredients are fresh, the avocado is not brown and the sandwiches are assembled with care. Both sandwiches included tomato, shredded lettuce, and lots of Dirty Sauce. Dirty Sauce is by far the best sandwich component, with a creamy texture and garlic-y flavor. I cannot identify the exact ingredients in the sauce, but I would eat it on a spoon if I can. Ike's also offers a selection of sides such as onion rings and fried zucchini, we didn't order them this time, but we will be sure to try them the next time we visit. Overall, this place lives up to the hype, and I will surely return.
This place is unbelievable. The first time I ate this, I couldn't believe that there were people lucky enough to live here and have a chance to eat this every day.The number of choices is somewhat overwhelming. No matter how picky you are, there is probably a sandwich that appeals to you. If not, they are happy to leave something out if needed.The one thing I would never recommend leaving out is the sauce, which is perfect. Rich and flavorful, it is amazing how many different sandwich combinations this works on. Scout out the options online ahead of time if you want to give it a lot of thought. Otherwise, face the board and realize you can't really go wrong.
You really need to be a masochist to get a sandwich here. Today I ordered online to avoid the line, and then went in 2 hours later for my pickup. After waiting in the smaller "pickup" line I finally was told "oh sorry our computer is down so that order didn't come through" but they could take my order again. I didn't have more time to wait so I said forget it... But then I checked my credit card and the they still charged me! So *that* "computer" wasn't down! And I called to ask for a refund and they said I need to call back another day!Bottom line: 2 1/2 hours, no sandwich but they took my $15!!
Visiting San Francisco and I HAD to try this place out! My best friend ordered the Castro sandwich and she loved it. I had the Thanksgiving sandwich and my taste buds were definitely giving thanks. My boyfriend had the Sabercat and it was by far one of the best sandwiches he ever had. We tried his sandwich and voted it the winner. Ike's place is a very chilled spot with no tables or chairs....it's more of an order-and-go spot but you are free to sit on the bench and enjoy your sandwich. If in San Fran, check this place out!
All the other bajillion reviews rave about the sandwiches, so I don't need to go on about some euphoric, flavorful experience of the Matt Cain, Super Mario, or (insert random name here) sandwich. Instead, here are three other insights: 1. Sign up on Ike's email list, and you'll receive a free sandwich coupon on your birthday. You have to use it within 7 days of your birthday, and you MUST print it out to redeem it. (I tried to redeem it by showing them my phone screen, and no can do, missy). 2. Sandwiches are more heavy on sauces and cheeses. Not so hip on fresh veggies. Read- special creamy sauce over roasted, marinated veggie-ness. Sauces give good flavor, but I also like me sandwiches with some good veggies in it. Ike's uses bland iceberg lettuce and tomatoes. Meh. I ordered the Menage A Trois, which is the most popular sandwich. It was good, but not ZOMG pop out my eyeballs good- as everyone seems to claim. 3. There'll be a line. Try placing your order in advance by phone or ordering app. I prefer more local sandwich shops, as Ike's has expanded recently. Nevertheless, Ike's is a San Francisco/ Bay Area experience that you have to try at least once.
Ike's remains my favorite sandwich place to date. Many of their sandwiches come with their Dirty Sauce which really brings the sandwich together. Good sandwiches are hard to pull off in that many are simple, but often bland and dry. Personally, I believe Ike's does what they do very well because I do enjoy a lot of flavor, sauce, and good crunchy outer layer. My favorite sandwich from the place is Doomsday, which is twice the size of their normal sandwich and includes a spicy sauce. Despite the amount of ingredients it has (Bacon, EXTRA Jack, HABANERO Salsa, Ham, Mozzarella Sticks, Pastrami, Roast Beef, Salami, Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers, Turkey), the price is a bit higher than I think it should be at $26.62. I usually split it with one or 2 friends because the sandwich will get soggy from all the sauce. The best things to note are:-there are usually long lines-there is limited seating and no tables-the sandwiches are EXPENSIVE, but Ike's is good for an occasional meal-you can call in advance to avoid the lines-they have a huge menu online! Have fun with your selection.
Yes obviously the sandwiches are good, really good. But the pickup situation is less than ideal, and actually really bad. I ordered two sandwiches which were supposed to be ready in 20 minutes. I arrived on time and then of course had to wait an additional 15 minutes to receive the sandwiches. This wouldn't be so bad if the storefront had chairs or even a clean floor. The Place is downright dirty and gross. Since 15 other people were sitting on the bench that runs the sides of the walls, I stood next to the trashcans...
Disclaimer: Another Greg was waiting and took my sandwich in a mix-up (the guy didn't check which sandwich it was) so I ended up waiting half an hour extra while my friends held their sandwiches in their laps. Thus, I am not in good spirits right now.FOODI ordered The Bruce Damon on Dutch Crunch. The bread was crunchy, though not standout from other Dutch Crunch Rolls I've had. The flavors were well-balanced overall, and the Dirty Sauce was quite nice. The flavor was good enough for me to be willing to come again, but not quite as phenomenal as I'd hoped and definitely not good enough to wait for like I did today. Also not quite worth ~$15.BUSINESSTerrible management and/or a broken system. Phone calls are prioritized as the line builds. The door was open even though the line didn't go out the door, allowing the cold San Francisco air to permeate the entire building. If the girl at the register is wearing two jackets, what does that tell you? SHUT THE DOOR. After such a bad mix-up, it would have been nice to receive a bag of chips or something small as an apology (since the giys bringing out sandwiches didn't doublecheck which Greg the sandwich was for.....). What an unfortunate experience. I've heard so many good things that part of me would like to come back and try again, but I'm not very inclined to do so at the moment, especially with so many other places in the city to try.
About the place: Good spot. Went to the Castro location. No seating inside so order pick up or be prepared to wait. No booze either. About the order: I ordered the Hot mamma hudda. It was really good and was NOT drenched in ranch...just the right amount. I added pickles and was definitely glad I did! Also got it in Dutch crunch...YUM! About the timing: I wish the time estimates were better for pickup because it was cold-ish by the time I got it, BUT let me be clear it didn't stop me from demolishing it. Other: They actually have chips, French fries and jalapeo poppers but it's not on the menu on Yelp. If you want any of these add ons you should call in your order and not go through the app.
Holy moly. I believe that heaven in a sandwich is definitely a possibility now! My fianc told me about this place several times and we finally fit it into our trip the last time around. We actually called in the order (on a Sunday around lunchtime) and the wait was an hour still. We killed some time by checking out Haight Street then headed over...I didn't get out of the car when we picked it up, but I heard that pick up is the best way to go, as there isn't much seating inside anyways. My fianc ordered the "Kryptonite"(about $19) which was nothing short of a huge (literally double the size of mine), savory, drool - worthy masterpiece with... wait for it. .. avocado, bacon, beer battered onion rings, EXTRA pepper jack, ham, mozzarella sticks, pastrami, pesto, roast beef, salami, stuffed jalapeno poppers, turkey. I definitely had a foodgasm when I took a bite of that! I ordered the "Backstabber" (about $12), with not as many ingredients - caesar, halal chicken, marinated artichoke hearts, provolone cheese. That was also yummy, but I recommend eating this before trying our something like the Kryptonite, so it doesn't mess up your palate beforehand ;)Oh... and all ordered on the "Dutch Crunch" bread, of course :)I wish San Diego had a place like this. If you didn't like sandwiches before trying out this place, you'll definitely be in LOVE with Ike's after!!
At first glance, you might think "Where am I?" It's a pretty unassuming location. The last thing I would imagine is that world class sandwiches come from this place. But it turns out world class sandwiches is exactly what they produce. (Is it just me, or do hole in the wall-type places make amazing food way more often than you'd think?) They specialize in halal chicken, which is sandwich talk for some type of sorcery that makes the chicken incredible. I got the Spiffy Tiffy: an amalgamation of halal chicken, pesto and glorious things, smashed between Dutch bread. It was honestly amazing--and gigantic. I could've easily taken the other half home but the magic of the sandwich convinced me otherwise. I highly recommend eating there--not for the environment, not for the wait, but for the sandwich alone. While I'm on the wait...it did take quite a long time for the sandwich, so order ahead if you can.
I've only had the privilege of ordering once thus far from Ike's, and with literally dozens (maybe hundreds?) of options, that's not nearly enough. I ordered the Robin Williams and was greeted with a huge, delicious, and savory sandwich - one which I want to order again. But I'll probably never order it again, as every option on their menu looked equally impressive!I will say that this is an extremely popular business - and they also take an extra few minutes to infuse their TCL into each creation - so pick your battles wisely in terms of arrival time. Protip - make sure to accept the optional lollipop with your meal. I was given a caramel apple pop and it was super solid.
Well when the menu states :THE BEST MEATLESS MEATBALL SUB voted by Peta.. You have to go try it and thank goodness I did! The perfect amount of melted cheese to toasted warm bread. Even my not so vegan boyfriend couldn't stop raving about it. Very small shop with no seats or tables but there is a bench against the wall inside or just stand and eat it ...probably won't make it to the next block anyways. Must try another vegan option and seriously worth every penny!
This place makes the best sandwiches I've ever had. No matter what you get, put it on the Dutch Crunch. Atmosphere is cool. No matter if there's a line out the door (a majority of the time) or not, the workers are always helpful. Eating your sandwich at Dolores adds to the experience.I've had "Dont F with EK" (teriyaki chicken, Swiss, wasabi mayo) and "Bear Hug" (thin steak, jalapeo poppers, and extra dirty sauce). Both sound spicy but they just have a good zing to it! Definitely recommend these sandwich for the adventurous looking for a change up from the normal!
Best sandwiches ever! My favorite is mnage a trois (#111). A little pricey- about $13 for a whole sandwich (but it's huge), caramel apple lollipop, and sometimes chips. The worker this past Saturday told me chips are given during certain hours in the weekdays. Take your sandwich and enjoy eating it at Dolores Park!
I used to love this place but then it seemed like they changed their "fake meats" and I don't like them quite as much. I'm also not a fan of the vegan cheese they currently use
Part of me thinks that most people find this place amazing after they waited in line for an hour and need to feel that the wait was worth it. Next time I definitely need to order ahead and just pick up my sandwiches... why did I think that Ike's Place would be less busy at 2pm on a Sunday? Anyways the wait was pretty worth it for the first time because I spent an hour perusing their long menu for the best sandwich. Everything sounds so good! Then once you get inside, there are more options posted on the wall. Tough decisions, even if you are vegetarian or vegan.I decided on the Nacho Boy on Dutch Crunch with all the free toppings. Delicious! My dad got the side of fried zucchini with ranch and honey mustard dipping sauces. The fried zucchini was super soggy so that not should have been the last thing I chose to eat during my meal... fortunately Ike's gives each person a caramel apple lollipop for dessert!I like that they don't make people stand and wait for a long time AFTER they have ordered. It was also confusing because there is a sign posted on their wall saying they do not accept credit card when clearly they do. Things like that bother me as a newcomer. Anyways I'm a veteran now, and veterans should know to ORDER ONLINE!!
Honestly, with 6700 reviews and 4.5 stars, I don't know that I'm really adding much here.. but anyway..Really good sandwiches! The DUTCH CRUNCH sandwich bread is soooo good, but it gets soggy pretty easily from the sandwich sauces, so definitely eat it while it's still fresh! I guess you can't really go wrong with any of the sandwiches, but there's definitely some that I think are more unique and stand out and some that are more generic. ====================*** RECOMMEND ***-ELVIS KIETH (chicken, swiss, teriyaki, wasabi mayo) - 5/5I love this one! The chicken is really good and I really enjoy the teriyaki and wasabi mayo. Definitely recommend!-SOMETIMES I'M A VEGETARIAN (grilled mushrooms, artichoke hearts, pesto, provolone) - 4/5Veggie sandwiches can be good too! Really like the pesto, but I wish there were more veggies and less mayo.-SANCHEZ COLLEGE PREP (BBQ, chicken, cheddar) - 5/5You can never go wrong with BBQ and chicken====================*** OKAY ***-LINCECUM (avocado, bacon, ham, havarti, turkey) - 3/5Lots of meat in this one, so good if you're looking for that, but otherwise, nothing particularly special. Again, too much mayo for me-PURPLE B's VEGGIE CA-BLT (avocado, cheese, lettuce, tomato, veggie bacon) - 3.5/5I've never had veggie bacon before, but the one in this sandwich (which was pink to my surprise) is actually pretty good. It doesn't have the crisp texture of bacon (it's more like the texture of turkey sandwich meat), but it has a taste similar to bacon and I wouldn't have been able to tell that it wasn't meat. Definitely recommend for vegetarians!-PHIL EM UP'S BBQ (roast beef, BBQ, cheddar) - 3.5/5I think I only like this one because of the BBQ sauce. Otherwise, there's not much special about it. The roast beef is pretty average sandwich meat.====================*** PASS ***-AL BUNDY (avocado, french dressing, gouda, ham, salami) - 2.5/5Wasn't a huge fan of the french dressing in this one-BARRY B (bacon, swiss, turkey) - 2/5Pretty standard sandwich. Not very memorable
I rave about this place to everyone. Their sandwiches are flavorful and their menu is pretty different and always changing. This time, I got the Julius Caesar and it was pretty much what you think it is... A chicken caesar sandwich. It was good, didn't give me the wow effect like last time (when I ordered the spiffy tiffy).However, my parents ordered The Pride of Castro which had ham, brie and lettuce and it was the most weirdest thing. There was this after taste that I didn't enjoy and it just wasn't my thing..
High expectations are my worst enemy. Be it movies, restaurants, whatever you want (I thought neither Interstellar nor the first and third movie of the Dark Knight trilogy were rave-worthy. Let the hating begin). Whenever people rave about a place, I tend to be supremely disappointed. But Ike's, you were a rare, rare exception. I've heard about Ike's for a long time from my friends in the Bay Area, so when I finally made a trip up this past weekend, I knew it was somewhere I must visit. I opted for the "going home for thanksgiving" which includes turkey, cranberry sauce, sriracha, and havarti cheese, and this was definitely one of the simpler options.First of all, these sandwiches are freaking huge, and I basically paid around $10. Also, Ike's is having a promotion this month where they give away a free bag of chips and a free bottle of water/can of soda. Awesome.I lugged my giant sandwich to Dolores Park with a friend and finally took a bite. Oh lordy, it's good. Maybe it's the secret sauce, or the Dutch Crunch bread, but whatever it was, I definitely was having one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life. I really have nothing to complain about. Huge portions for cheap, great flavors, good service. I do wish that they served half portions, but not even going to complain.
I was finally able to go to this place after realizing that one existed now at Serramonte and thought, "Oh, nice! Now I'm actually close to the original, so this'll be an experience." It truly was, but I think I may have gotten the wrong sandwich.Let's start with service. It's excellent, but I will say that I was groaning in line because of all the "No Card" signs that were strewn around the place. The confusing thing was, they did seem to. But with all those signs...I mean, I wouldn't really know what to tell you. So I suppose to be safe, maybe have some cash on hand, just in case they point out the multitudes of signs that say you can't use a card (which I think is absurd if you're going to charge up to $27, which I think was the most expensive sandwich I saw on the board).Food? It was okay. I got the Mario or whatever it was - basically, a meatball sandwich with mozzarella sticks - and I couldn't believe that it was $14. Really? Okay, cool, mozzarella sticks in a sandwich is definitely new and different and fabulous, but the sandwich itself didn't taste all that special to me...at least, not $14 for a meatball sub special. I'm sort of out of luck considering I am allergic to mayo, and their special sauce is basically mayo, so...I mean, I'm not sure if I could ever eat any of the really, truly delicious, probably worth it sandwiches here.On that note, they did have an excellent selection of sodas that you won't often find. They've got off-brand butterbeer, which is more than anyone else can say! (Butterscotch soda, that's what it is.) They also give you a free caramel apple lollipop, which is a lovely gesture.I may try it again, as everyone was all shocked that I didn't like it as much as the majority of people, but eh.
This was our 4th visit here. The first experience was spectacular, only reason why we kept coming back. However this visit was different. The wait was about 45 minutes to an hour long? I ordered the Change with avocado. It didn't have enough BBQ sauce & the onion rings weren't crispy, just soggy.After we ordered, the line was out the door with only one person at the register. Glad I got mine in before that rush.
Don't waste your time. I started my review at 3 stars and reduced it to 1 after I waited, and waited, and waited, and waited. My first post: Only three stars is my balance point of great sandwiches versus a crappy ordering process. Order online for a pickup at noon doesn't work so well when upon arrival, the guy enters your order from one device into the another, which triggers the sandwich to enter the queue to be made. 12:27 pm now and I am still waiting.Update: Reducing stars to 2 because it's now 35 minutes after my online order was supposed to be available for pickup and my sandwich still isn't ready.Update: now only 1 star because it's more than 47 minutes after my pickup should have been ready. I'm not the only one here with this issue. One couple waited for over an hour.The poor guy at the front is manually entering online orders from three different devices into Ike's computer. Isn't this area tech central??? There is a better way. The poor guy can't even help anyone because his head is buried in the computer screens while he MANUALLY types in online orders from the 3 different devices (an eat24 device, an iPad, and some other mobile device) into Ike's system. 64 minutes past pickup time and no sandwich. I guess the upside is that it gave me plenty of time to add commentary to this review?Meanwhile there are sandwiches piling up in the kitchen, and no one is bringing them out to the customers.
Although the sandwiches are good, having to wait a good 30-40min to get one is not really worth it.The menage trois was a bit sweet, but still tasty. I enjoyed the Main Cain a lot better. Tasted more like a real hearty sandwich. Lots of meat! It's also a bit pricy. We got two sandwiches and 2 sodas. Bill came about to about $40?
ive been to ikes handful of times in the last 5 years, but each time i visited, I had a different experience.ive been here where the wait was less than 10 mins and ive been here where the wait was 1 hr.anyways i guess its time write a review. as much as i liked some of the sandwiches ive eaten here, its been inconsistent. I've eaten sandwiches here that were barely better than subway with the same subway quality of service for a $13. and ive eaten magical sandwiches from Ikes that made me run back to get another.And thats my gripe. I dont know what kind of sandwich ill get when i visit. their consistency is all over the place.my last sandwich: my chicken was dry, dutch crunch wasnt crunchy and the shredded lettuce crumpled into little bits like mcdonald's dehydrated onions (if you dont know what that is, look it up). wait was 1hr+. they had only 1 cashier during the lunch rush trying to handle the line, online orders and the delivery guys. i looked into the kitchen, sandwiches would just sit on the counter for 5 to 10 mins without someone assembling it. I literally saw the cheese harden back up after the sandwich was toasted. i saw one of staff drop a glob of mayo onto the counter, she then scraped it back up with her spatula and spread it back on to the sandwich.i knew the line was long before, but at least its not a mess like now. looks like staff was just d*cking around too. Ike needs to come back and slow down the expansion before things CONSISTENTLY gets worse.
I used to frequent ikes at Stanford before it closed down- now that I live in the city in so psyched I live close to an ikes again! They have the best, most unique sandwiches. Gets SUPER crazy around lunch time, but it's nice that you can order ahead online to skip the line. Parking here is tricky and they don't really have seating, so it's best to do a sandwich grab and plan to eat elsewhere.
This place is in the Castro, usually has a line out the door and offers really good sandwiches (it's a take-out only place, no seating available, cash-only). I've had the spiffy tiffy and the Menage A Trois sandwiches with Dutch Crunch bread.These sandwiches are very big, heavy and delicious, but not something I'd eat everyday. The Menage A Trois contains halal chicken with a spicy 'dirty' sauce (their signature sauce) with honey (makes the meat pretty sweet, and reminds me of BBQ chicken).
Waited way to long for our sandwiches it was written on the paper. Say hey. Which should be pastrami bacon and Swiss cheese. Instead it came out with chicken lettuce and tomatoes.  Lady helping was very friendly. None of us ordered chicken and again it said say hey on the paper. Maybe more training. Or more staff not sure what they need here. Defiantly not the place to come to sit and hang out.When my "correct" sandwich came out it wasn't hot nor did it have pepper jack cheese on it as I requested.
Definitely 5 star worthy...this is the best sandwich I've ever had AND best gluten free sandwich in the world probably! You'd think that "it's just a sandwich" what's the big deal? But seriously, you have to go and try one! Being celiac, I haven't had a really good sandwich in a looong time. When I do find one, people usually just make them on the usual Udi's bread. Not Ike's!! This was on a gf French bread roll just like the normal sandwiches...and it was crazy good!! I didn't notice once that I was eating gluten free. I got the Spiffy Tiffy sandwich...it was delicious! I would definitely get it again even though all of the menu looked legit. The girl who took my order told me that they ran out of green pesto but could sub red pesto. Since this was my first time, I can't compare it to the original sandwich but I loved it just the same. The service was also great - super friendly and great sense of humor. She even told the kitchen I had a gluten "allergy" so they would change their gloves etc!! Awesome! Wish I lived in SF so I could eat here every week!
Ike's is am such a great place! Can be quick to grab a sandwich and go, you can even order ahead. Some places have sit down areas, this one doesn't, which is a bit of a downer, but it was the closest location for us after the gym lolThe menu has SOO many options for food loves who are craving so much! You can add Jalapeno poppers, cheese sticks, so many different sauce to choose from! You can make your own or you can choose from all the different sandwiches on the menu! They have the awesome "Zapps potato chips" great on the side of AMAZING sandwiches! This is always the bet sandwich place to go to around SF, and the Bay Area in general!
Ike's Place is definitely one of those things you should try once when you're in the bay. This was my first time trying the sandwich shop, and I have to say I was quite satisfied with my meal. The place is small with no real seating, and you have to find street parking to be able to reach this place. The line moved fairly quickly when I went, but I can see how this place can get packed and have a line out the door on some days and times. Their menu is very extensive and they're said to have over 200 different sandwich combinations that they regularly switch around on their menu. I tried the We're Just Friends sandwich which was stuffed with halal chicken marinated in a sweet orange glaze, avocado and pepper jack cheese on their signature Dutch crunch bread roll. I also added in lettuce, tomato, red onions, banana peppers, jalapeos and pickles. I really liked how they used halal chicken for a meat option because it's shredded and a lot easier to chew versus a whole chicken breast piece in my opinion. My sandwich was made quickly and was definitely huge! It was such a filling meal and all the ingredients tasted well together. Overall a great sandwich place that I wouldn't mind getting again if I'm in the city!
I was visiting SF for a week, and a friend recommended trying this place out. You might call this the "Sandwich Mecca" of Northern California because the sandwich selection seemed limitless from meat options to gluten options to even vegan options. The sandwich saints made sure each sandwich is packed with enough protein and veggies. This meal definitely held us up for the whole day before dinner.I recommend getting your sandwich with the Dutch crunch bread which is their signature bread. The bread is slightly sweet with a crunchy texture, plus it's gluten free. Who would've thought gluten free bread could taste so good? Honestly, I don't think there's one sandwich you must try. It seems like you can't go wrong in that department. It's just personal preference.
After being told it was going to take 20 minutes to get my sandwich, 50 minutes later the sandwich finally emerged. If that's your thing, cool. Good sandwich, but long wait and rude service will keep me forming coming back. I mean seriously, 50 minutes for a sandwich.
It's pretty obvious Ike's Place is one of San Francisco's greatest attractions for locals and tourists all around. They offer a variety of amazing specialty gourmet sandwiches for very decent prices. I would not say this is the BEST sandwich place ever, because I've had some pretty bomb sandwiches all over SF -- include Submarine Center at West Portal (my favorite!). But I've got to say that Ike's has the BEST Dutch Crunch rolls. They're actually crunchy, while some places are on the verge of tasting stale. The lines to order are almost always out the door and about 20+ people deep, about 20 mins. The wait to get your order is another 20 mins. Although there are a lot of free 2 hour parking around that area, it's located in the heart of Castro so finding parking can be a hit or miss, probably another 20 mins. I do suggest eating sandwiches fresh when they make it before the bread becomes soggy from the sauce overload. There are a bunch of cute public benches along Market Street a block down. You can sit and people watch in the heart of Castro -- loves it! I like Matt Cain a lot. The deli meats are perfectly flavored and the cheese is a nice added punch. The sauce can be a bit overwhelming though. The Spiffy Tiffy is another popular choice, but I think while the creaminess is there with the avocado, it's missing a certain kick -- maybe some hot sauce?All in all, Ike's Place is definitely worth the try and maybe another one and another one!
Do me a favor... Google "Ike's Place Secret Menu"I'll wait. Actually i'll give you a link to check out... thrillist.com/eat/san-frDid you click on the link?? Oh Sh*t you did it... You're welcome. Now Enjoy the many different possibilities of flavor combinations that will now invade your mouth. You see, the first time i came here, I only knew about the sandwich selections available on the board. Big whoop I thought back then. I thought of it as an over-rated Subway Restaurant, but after learning about their "not so secret" menu ... oh my golly miss molly.. Dee-lish-shush! I got the #69 Sexy Boy Sandwich consisting of mozzarella sticks, thinly sliced rib-eyed steaks, sandwiched between a dutch crunch roll. The crunchyness of the roll and the mozerella sticks made me salivate... The tender rib-eyes steak slices flooded my heart with pure joy... and the dirty sauce? THE DIRTAY SAUCE?? creamy creamy creamy!!! it left me speechless... So i must admit... this place is good. And apparently, I'm not the only one who thinks this. Be prepared for the lines. I suggest calling in and ordering ahead. Oh and another thing.... After ordering my sandwich, I think i read a sign saying that they serve side orders of fries Monday -Thursday? i might be wrong... but imagine how much better the world would be if i was right about the fries? Then imagine the fries dipped in Dirty sauce? Go ahead... imagine. *crying inside*
First off, you HAVE to get the dutch crunch bread!!! Sadly, when I went, it was the day of the storm and a lot of power was out. They didn't get their delivery for dutch crunch and only had wheat in stock. I was reallllly sad, but nonetheless it was still a delicious sandwich.I got the Spiffy Tiffy - avocado, halal chicken breast with pesto, tomatoes, lettuce, mushrooms, pepperjack, and provolone. It was such a HUGE sandwich. I was really full after only eating half. It's quite a deal, you get a sandwich, caramel apple lollipop, a bag of chips, and water or soda. Deals! TIP: if you think its going to be busy, I would advise to call in your order and skip the line and wait! I've only had one sandwich and it was delicious. I can't wait to try the rest when I'm back in Cali.
It's a sandwich. Nothing special. The service is rude. They are an average sandwich shop by NYC standard. This would be considered a Sh hole in Philly.
Holy geezus these sandwiches are good! K and I were starving, and after searching for parking in a different part of town, we gave up and headed to Dolores Park, which led us to Ike's! It was like 3 pm, and there was a huge line out of Ike's! I wasn't discouraged; I thought, man, this place must be worth the wait! And it was!! Maybe its a good thing the wait is so long, so you have time to decide which of their many sandwich options you'd like to get. I had no idea what the dutch crunch bread was, but I got it anyways. Someone described it as crispy cornflakes on your bread. Whatever it is, it's real good! I had the Vegan Handsome Owl. It was a messy and delicious sandwich! K had the Menage A Trois, also on Dutch Crunch bread. The sandwiches are huge, but no worries. They're delicious enough that you'll want to finish it or, if not, save it for later! And you get a lollipop with your sandwich.
Being from the East Coast, I had never tried Ike's before and had always wanted to, so I was pretty excited for my first taste. I ordered "The Little Mermaid" on the Dutch Crunch and loved it! "The Little Mermaid" was a combination of chicken, lettuce, a delicious orange glaze, and avocado. It was sweet, salty, creamy, and crunchy. The Dutch Crunch was delicious, crusty, and kind of like a ciabatta. The whole sandwich came out to a little more than $10 (which I was told was a little more than the South Bay prices), but probably weighed like 1.5 pounds. I was able to make two meals out of it. Some of my friends ordered the "Menage a Trois" and the "Matt Cain" and really liked those as well.One downside is that the line went out the door. I took that time to look at the online menu (which is much more extensive than what is in store). The service was a bit slow as well, but understandable considering the volume of customers in the store. Another downside is that there isn't a lot of sitting room. You pretty much have to take it to go or eat a little awkwardly against the windows.
Whatttt can I say. This place is so good. I came here for the first time with my family and friends, I didn't really want anything on the menu. So I modified a sandwich that was listed and it turned out to be called the "Eli manning". can't go wrong with that! It was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. I can't wait to come back here. It's a small hole in the wall but don't let that discourage you from coming in!
Ike's is the best sandwich place in town. Period. Do yourself a favor and look online for the menu. There are hundreds of sandwiches and in house they just Mark the board with maybe 20 or so for the day. The sammies all have great names. I prefer the Yale University (which is the Menag-a-twa with bacon)Also, get the voodoo chips. They are so strange but wonderful. If you pay in cash they sometimes have free chip specials!
Another highly recommended place!We ordered over the phone (menu can be found online although it varies by location) and were told it would take an hour. An hour later, we waited for about 10min to pick up our orders.The Spiffy Tiffy: Avocado, Halal Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepper Jack, Pesto, Provolone. Just basked in it's perfection. I always appreciate it when restaurants put a good amount of avocado and Ike's delivered...thank you for doing avocado some justice. Half the sandwich easily filled me for half the day. Also recommend the Dutch crunch bread, great for this sandwich. They also gave us caramel apple lollipops!Well worth the wait and cost, try it at least once!
M.A.T. , commonly something from some book that was written many years ago, Ike has made it much better by combining shredded chicken with bbq sauce, honey, and honey mustard as well as the other stuff--- it's one super wet sandwich and is super juicy and delicious. If you're not a fan of sweet meat then don't get that sandwich.Sandwiches come with a free soda (can), bag of chips (get voodoo), and caramel apple pop.
Great sandwich consistently! We love the turkey Pesto on Dutch crunch, the mnage a trois is also awesome. If your in the city you gotta try it!
Ordered the Elvis Keith mainly because it was halal chicken, teriyaki, swiss and wasabi mayo. It was pretty empty which was suprising at 1130ish am. Upon walking in there was only one person ordering. The woman was complaining how they raised the price of Spicy Tiffy to 12 or 13 dollars and didn't update it on yelp or their website. That was a small red flag but I disregarded it.Received my Elvis Keith after a 10 minute wait. Proceeded to walk outside to find a suitable place to eat it. Found a place after 5 minutes and after opening the sandwich wrapper I was unpleased to see how my bottom slice of bread was drenched through with their teriyaki sauce. They were definitely too generous with the teriyaki sauce. The bread was dutch crunch and I think this isn't the same dutch crunch as compared to Roxy's or Ms. Tomatoes or New Daly City Market. It was more like "dutch crunch lite".  Also, I barely tasted any wasabi mayo in the sandwich aside from my second bite. Maybe it was the teriyaki sauce overpowering it or they were just skimpy or the wasabi wasn't strong.This was one of my first sandwich where I felt diminishing returns after every single bite. I finished the sandwich but it wasn't worth almost 10 dollars. Ingredients wise: chicken 4 stars, bread 2 stars, teriyaki -1 star, wasabi mayo 2 stars, swiss 3 stars. I'll stick with other sandwich places.
This review is ONLY for the sandwich purchased on Thursday 10/29 at the 16th St location in SF.I have been addicted to Ike's vegetarian sandwiches since 2008, visiting many different locations and loving every... single... bite. Never had I ever been let down... until this week :( IKE they need your help at this location ASAP! They're gonna ruin your reputation.The Love Triangle, my favorite sandwich in the world. Sauce galore, 3 different ones, leaving a trail of Ike's to be cleaned for days! Three different cheeses and breaded vegan Chicken smushed between the thin, crunchy, infamous Dutch Crunch bread. However, this sandwich had NO cheese (which of course I didn't find out until I was too far away to have them fix), not nearly as much sauce as I'm used to, and the bread was far too thick! The combo of extra thick bread and not enough sauce made this a not so fun experience. Plus no cheese?! This was NOT an Ike's sandwich.Don't allow this location to dictate your opinion of Ike's Sandwiches. Go to the Walnut Creek location, they're ALWAYS on point.
Hands down the best place for a sandwich! Thanks :)
Delicious sandwiches made fresh at a good price.Prepare to wait a while. Order online a few hours ahead!
Great place, perfect sandwiches ! I love the E 24 option( always order to go )Never been this appointed- it's just one great sandwich place!
Literally, my favorite sandwhich place in San Francisco. If you are visiting from out of town you have to stop here!
After a vacation in San Francisco full of waiting and eating at all the trendy places, I decided to go to Ike's on the way out. I was excited because I love sandwiches. So my girlfriend and I arrive, and the line is fairly long, with a lot of people waiting for their food. I've never seen such slow service for sandwiches. The closest comparison would be Earls in Vegas, but even they get the food out fairly quickly. So we ordered the mnage, spiffy tiffy, and beer battered onion rings. It took about 50 minutes to get out food. Holy hell how can it take that long? Not only that, we saw food on the counter for about 10 minutes just sitting there. We finally asked the cashier to check on our food and he immediately bags up the food we had seen and hands it to us. Are you kidding me?I know this place is all about their sandwiches, but I love onion rings so I had to try. Well, what I got was lukewarm, soggy, bland, flour covered onions. Probably the worst onion rings of my life. Most of them tasted like flour, and one of them was almost completely raw. Almost threw up. Mnage a trois was pretty good. Bbq sauce was a little overpowering but I enjoyed the sandwich overall. Dutch crunch was good but soggy. Probably from just sitting on the damn counter. Spiffy tiffy was tasty but nothing to write home about. A little dry even with the pesto. Luckily we had a side of the dirty sauce and that made it a lot better. If I was eating this place solely on the sandwiches, I'd give it 4/5. However that's not how Yelp works. The whole experience gets a 2, maybe even a 1.5 if I could. I would go back and try other sandwiches, making sure I order ahead
Ike's is like the critically acclaimed sandwich place of the west coast. Everyone has incredible amazing things to say about this place and if you are visiting SF, it's natural to have Ike's on your radar. Perhaps it was the hype that gave me high expectations, but this place was really nowhere near what I had imagined. I got the Damon Bruce (and it's popular!) the ribeye with fried onion rings, provolone and steak sauce. it was about $13 and extremely underwhelming. Check out Seport Deli in LI and tell me this can compare. There's no way that this sandwich place would ever match any of those acclaimed sandwich places in other areas. The ingredients ratio to the bread (and I got dutch!), was just not proportional and I felt I was eating a lot of bread and not enough of what should have been inside. The bread was dry and kind of crunchy everywhere, it wasn't soft or chewy inside or fresh tasting it literally felt like I was eating bread from a few days ago. The ribeye wasn't bad, but it didn't mesh well with the bread and there wasn't enough sauce to soften the blow. I only ate half - and yea I guess the Damon Bruce is a good choice if you want to save half for later (I didn't get it with lettuce or tomatoes), but I really wouldn't recommend it. I went with some friends who were visiting and one got the Damon Bruce and the other a different sandwich - and we all came to the same conclusion - this place is overrated.
Best sandwiches I've ever had. Going to SF this weekend and Ike's is a mandatory stop. Don't deprive yourself, y'all. It is so worth it. Getting chips + a drink + ice cream easily puts your order past $20 but keeping it to just a sandwich will have it around $10. Best meal of my life.
Good sandwich, but it didn't blew me away.Ike's Place is definitely one of the most popular sandwich shops in San Francisco. In fact, its popularity created so much noise and trash that local neighbors filed complains and forced Ike's Place to relocate from its original location to the current location in 2011 (sfexaminer.com/sanfranci). Ike's Place is famous for two things - dutch crunch and dirty sauce. You can call ahead of time to avoid the potentially long waiting line. However, the store opened at 10 AM on Saturday and there was NO LINE at all.Nacho Boy (Roast Beef, Mushrooms, Avocado, Swiss - $12.21, with Ike's World Famous Dutch Crunch): The gluten-free dutch crunch bread was ... as the name stated, crunchy. It was pretty solid, but I didn't jump up and down after I finished the whole sandwich. You know what, I should have requested extra dirty sauce because I couldn't really taste the dirty sauce ...Not as good as Langer's Deli in LA and Baguette Cafe in Las Vegas, but I still like Ike's Place a lot. Next time, I will probably visit its new Los Angeles location and try different sandwiches until I find the one I really love.P.S. - I got a free caramel apple lollipop, but did not get a free bag of chips.
Because Ike's! Sandwiches are LEGIT AF, but the kitchen is seriously as slow as molasses.
This place has the best sandwiches in the bay hands down! I always go here whenever I'm in SF and I was never disappointed. My favorite is the menage a trois. The dirty sauce and the chicken was a perfect combination, it's messy but juicy and delicious. The only downside is the long waits and limited seating. You can order online for pick-up. The long line speaks for itself.
Came here while on vacation with the bf. I got the pastrami sandwich there on the menu as most ordered. It was incredible, the sauce they put on it makes it perfect! Hint: get a side of pepperoncini and thank me later. Yes, there's a line, but the service is great and I got a lollipop in my to go bad :)
I honestly think this place is overrated. I got the saber tooth (chicken fried steak with some yellow sweet bbq sauce and bacon) which seemed to be a popular item on the menu. It was around $12..crazy price for a sandwich!! A lot of food..you could probably split it with someone, except for the fact that they didn't cut it exactly in half. Maybe I haven't found the perfect sandwich yet?
Food was amazing. I came during happy hour where soda and a bag of chips were included in meal. This little shop offers uniquely named sandwiches. I got the kryptonite Sandwich which was big enough to serve 4 hungry people. There was even a side of lollipop for after your meal. The employees were friendly helpful and had a wonderful sense of humor. A trip to sf is not complete without visiting this place
My gosh lower your prices for the fellow celiacs. OK YES I am high maintenance and ordered a vegetarian gluten free sandwich but $14? It's even smaller than the regular sandwiches!Besides that-- great gf bread, seriously.
The sandwiches at Ike's are great, but after you've had enough of the dirty sauce and the dutch crunch bread, they really aren't that special. The prices for these sandwiches are absurd, and the wait is very long, even if you order online in advance. A sandwich with a small layer of meat with lettuce, tomato, and sauce and a lot of bread should not cost $13 bucks in my opinion. Could have had 4 In-N-Out burgers.
I returned to Ike's before leaving SF to share the We're Just Friends and The Damon Bruce. The only modification made to the sandwiches was an addition onions to both sandwiches and Godfather Sauce on the side, which I added to the We're Just Friends. As before, the sizes are large - we purchased two sandwiches to share and I couldn't finish mine. The sandwiches themselves were very good and on par with our previous visit. We took our sandwiches to Dolores Park on a Friday afternoon and had a lovely al fresco dinner! Verdict: I continue to recommend Ike's Place.
So after doing some research on Yelp I believe that this is the most reviewed place on the entire site in ANY city. Now I may be wrong but I couldn't find anywhere that even came close to 6700 reviews and btw THAT'S EFFING INSANE! Now ...most reviewed doesn't always mean it's great, actually in some cases it has meant that the place is down right awful but luckily with Ike's it means that it's certified GODLY. I just had to make this spot my #1 "Must Eat" stop on my short birthday trip here because of the high reviews, amazing looking sandwiches and I also read that they do free sandwiches for birthdays .Yes, you heard that right, they do FREE SANDWICHES for birthdays. All you have to do is sign up for the E-club on their website but for me it wouldn't work...for some reason the link never opened when I tried to do so weeks before visiting here. I messaged the business and even messaged Ike personally but man that dude must be busy because I never got a reply from either message. I was hoping to explain my situation once I got to Ike's Place but either way I wanted to try them out whether it was free or not. Any ways, It was a bit of a bus ride away from our hotel but once we got to the area it was in a pretty hip and cool neighbourhood. There was a small but quick line and when I asked about the birthday promo the girl at the counter said I had to sign up to the e-club. When I explained what happened she said she'd let me get the promo if I just showed her my ID and it was actually really painless so that made me feel REAL GOOD :p. I ordered the "Harrison Barnes" and my GF got the "we're just friends" ( what a slap in the face! ) lol jk. These were two of the best sandwiches I have ever tasted in my life...the bread, the ingredients OMFFFFGGG! I crave them daily. This place isn't cheap, in fact it's damn near expensive but it's a must try at least once in your life because these sammies are absolutely LEGEN...WAIT FOR IT...DARY!!
There sandwiches here are pretty amazing but the wait is ridiculous! I recommend calling in, unless you like lines... good names and even better sandwiches! cant go wrong with the lincicum and that bread! so good! This place is definitley on the to eat list when i'm out here.
PLEASE do yourself a favor and get the Dutch crunch bread. It's got the best texture & really makes the sandwich. There aren't any tables in here, so be prepared to eat out of your lap. We went around 4:30pm so there wasn't a ginormous line. We tried the mnage a trois and the spiffy tiffy. The biggest difference between the two (aside from ingredients) is that the MaT was hot while the ST was cold. I definitely thing the hot sandwich tastes better. The ST was a bit dry for my taste. I need to go back and try another sandwich, quick! My bf loved his MaT. If you download the app, you can order ahead and avoid the line. I would suggest looking online to see a larger menu of their sandwiches. People were ordering things off the menu and I was jealous.
Found myself here yesterday... For starters, thee worst time to be here is during the lunch hour rush.... Based on coverage, this locations sucks big time on reliability time.... Seeing the actual amount of workers making the sandwiches seemed very thin and one cashier? And their supposed ordering on-line is a hit or miss.... there were a handful of customers waiting for up to 20-30 minutes... I myself, the wait time seemed like an eternity but i got my Elvis Keith in under 30 minutes. It's pricey but so worth it if you're willing to hang in there.
The product is a 5. The speed of service is a 1. These guys always have a line out the door and seem shocked they are busy. Hope you're not hungry when you arrive as you will be waiting 30 min for a sandwich.
Good God I love these sandwiches. My first Ike's experience was in Redwood City but this one is the OG! On the weekends be prepared for the wait though- ours was about 45 minutes! Fun fact: the sandwiches are the same at all locations but they have different names depending on where you go. If you know the ingredients let em' know and they can point you in the the right direction. Last but not least, go with the Dutch Crunch bread! It is absolutely delicious!Ike's, Ike's, baby!
Holy batman this place is good! Was recommend this place from a friend and I'm so glad they did. My sandwich was so good that I'd keep ordering it every time I'd come. And that's how all of my friends felt about their sandwiches too so all of the sandwiches must be good. It must be that delicious dirty sauce! The wait was a bit long but completely worth it. I will defiantly be coming back!
Well, it was easy to figure out why this place is so slow. Not everything is listed on the menu, so while the cashier seems well intentioned, every tourist with a simple question gets bombarded with three other complex sandwich choices. As I get closer to the register, every order takes at least 5 minutes. I think this might be intentional to keep the line long and the hype large. I also witnessed customers who chose to pick up and their order was magically lost.Sandwiches were good, but not worth the wait.
I'll just leave this with the 6000+ other reviews.Came in on a Friday round 4pm after just getting back from SFO. There was no line at all and I got my order in pretty quickly. Ordered the Damon Bruce on Dutch Crunch, which is thinly sliced steak, onion rings, provolone, and all the fixings. I don't know if I'm buying too much into the hype, but that sandwich was pretty darn good. It's just crazy how much the bread matters in a sandwich. The Dutch Crunch was still crunchy, but had a fairly soft inside, and didn't get too soggy with all of the ingredients and sauces. With all of the different ingredients and choices like vegan meats and gluten-free breads, there's something for everyone.You get a free water/soda if you pay with cash, and a free lollipop if you ask. The people at the register are very friendly, and were very patient even though I was definitely taking my sweet time ordering. I got my sandwich within a few minutes. It was so good that I had to come back a few days later, right before flying out of SFO. I will go as far as saying that Ike's makes some of the best sandwiches I've ever had.I'll have to try the Kryptonite or Lex Luthor next time I'm in town. Someone ordered it after me, and it was insanely big. Challenge accepted.
Ike's has been popping up all over the place including in Westwood now at my old Bruin stopping grounds. Loved Ike's for getting to try the Dutch Crunch bread for the first time.// SERVICE // You can order in advance via online app, phone or just stop by// FOOD //   + Dutch Crunch bread: Get your sandwich on Dutch Crunch, a Nor Cal fave! Crusty crunch outside and soft and fluffy inside   + Spiffy Tiffy: So much flavor with the pesto and has all my faves including avocados, mushrooms, and provolone cheese   + Menage a Trois: Saucy cheese-y goodness with BBQ Chicken Cannot wait to try the LA location!
Oct 2015. Worst managed sandwich shop I've ever seen. I come here frequently for pickups for work and I now expect to take an hour while I'm here. 10-30 people in line to place orders, 10-20 people waiting to pick up, 5-10 finished orders getting cold/warm on the shelf and 0 people working the registers. "I'll go check" is code for I'll go in the back and vanish. I hate this shop. 45-60 minute wait for a sandwich is never worth it. Been waiting for an hour and 20 minutes..... Only 8 sandwiches have been finished in that time. An assembly line in the back that only makes 6 sandwiches an hour. Really?!?!Suggestion. New management, new employees, and/or someone ALWAYS at the register.
If taste is of high priority, this place with their dirty sauce will do it. Their Dutch crunch was a wowy experience. Ashley was a big help to coordinate which sandwiches to go for. She should get a raise or nice tips :) great customer service!They have several vegetarian options if one doesn't want meat. Better eat certain sandwiches soon because the sauce gets into the bread so say within half hour at most. That's not a negative at all, the bread is sooo good as well as the sauce. I wouldn't want a different bread choice, you can choose other breads if you want Definitely want to come back :)
WOW! SO MUCH WOW! I had Ike's for the first time and I was beyond satisfied. I listened to my friend and read the yelp reviews ahead of time about the long lines so we ordered while driving to the city. It's not much of a sit down, you just go in, order, grab, and go. After looking through the overwhelmingly long menu, I decided to get the Spiffy Tiffy and my friend got the Jessica Rabbit (both on French bread). They were so different and ridiculously tasty! At around $12 a sandwich. I was expecting a lot and that's exactly what I got. It's cut in half but it might as well be two whole sandwiches. To top it off, they add caramel apple lollipops in the bag too! It's a short walk away to Delores Park so I would totally recommend eating it there on a nice day and just enjoy the view of the city/people hanging out. Such good vibes.It's a good thing I live on the opposite coast because I would be here everyday!!
Holy Sandwich Menu Galore! Terrible street parking. Ordered to go so I did not have to wait for the sandwiches to be made. Paid in a cash and got a free soda. Another food channel spot I have seen a bunch of times.Spiffy Tiffy - $11.11 - Halal chicken was cooked and seasoned well. Loved the fresh veggies, pesto, and avocado. All the toppings balanced each other out well. It was stuffed and super heavy. I could not finish this if I tried.Menage-a-Trois - $12.21 - The combo of BBQ, honey, and honey mustard made everything taste too sweet. Chicken was cooked well but the sweet sauces just made each bite taste like candy chicken. If it had some heat it would have made it a lot better. Again the sandwich was stuffed!I can finally take Ikes off my list. Going to give the new LA location a try!
Recommendation: Get the Kash app to get 5 dollars off 4 separate orders each. Incredible variety and delicious sandwiches at a reasonable price. No seating for dining in. I can't wait to go back!After a day spent in Dolores Park, we were looking for interesting food in the vicinity and found Ike's Place. Mainly it was the interesting food names on the menu that brought us in! You have to take a look, it's pretty hilarious! Once we got there, the line was literally out the door. We were on the sidewalk for a few minutes before stepping food inside. Once inside, we were able to see the menu at the back of the restaurant (a little hard to read at that distance) as well as a giant "Ike's Place" sign on the east wall. There were also signs everywhere inside the restaurant advertising a partnership with Kash, an app you can use to pay for your food. While it said you could get $20 free, what it actually meant was that you could get a $5 off coupon for each transaction you make, up to 4 transactions. This meant that my 14 dollar sandwich only ended up being 9 dollars, instead of free with $6 left over. I ended up getting the Damon Bruce sandwich, which had sliced rib-eye steak on it. While it was a little more expensive than the standard $10 sandwiches, it was fantastic! Not only that, but it was loaded up with ingredients and extremely filling. It easily kept me full for two meals during a day of hiking and walking. All in all, Ike's Place is definitely somewhere you should visit. Between the excellent value and quality of the sandwiches, the opportunity to save some money, and the creative decoration and menu items, every part of the experience was great. I'm definitely a fan, and can't wait to tell my friends about this place!
Visiting from out of town. This place was packed. They were incredibly fast. Definitely planning to go back while it town. Next time gonna maul Matt cain.
This a great place to grab a sandwich.... I am really impressed with the fresh bread, sauce and meat flavors and tasty but not greasy sides. Reminds me of the small delis in Milwaukee.
Oh baby you (oh baby you) Got what I need (got what I need)But you say I'm just a friend (say I'm just a friend)But you say I'm just a friend...hahaha oh Ike's sandwiches they are pretty delicious and fresh. I had the menage a trois (bbq, cheddar,halal chicken,honey mustard,pepper jack,real honey and swiss) I also had the spiffy tiffy ( avocado,halal chicken,mushroom,pepper jack, pesto, and provolone) these sandwiches were on point! I went during happy hour and was able to get free chips and a drink per sandwich, pretty awesome! And to put a cherry on top I had a special surprise in my bag (caramel apple lollipop) I was one happy camper :)I called ahead of time and did not wait long, so if you can call ahead of time definitely do it.
I've been coming here every so often when I visit my cousins in SF or when I'm traveling with friends/family. Ike's has not disappointed me (except their long waits because I hate standing).If you haven't been to Ike's before, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE look at their menu online! They only write a select few sandwiches on their board so browse and see what interests you!Their sandwiches are HUGEE! Half a sandwich will keep me content so I tend to make two meals out of a sandwich. I love their Dirty Sauce and Dutch Crunch bread with my sandwiches! They really add that crispy texture and creamy and garlic flavor I look for in a sandwich. My favorites are the Matt Cain (if you're a meat lover like I am, this is a definite YES), Menage a Trois, and Nacho Boy. The only downside of this location is their limited "seating" and no tables. And by "seating" I mean ledges outside of the shop because people sitting on the benches inside of the shop are waiting for their sandwiches. Best is to take it to go, walk Dolores park nearby, and eat it there. In addition, it is difficult to find parking nearby so be prepared to walk; it's SF what do you expect?They also offer a pick-up spot where you can phone-in your order or place an order using their online app. But it's typically masked by crowds standing around for their sandwiches to be called. Since I don't live nearby, I rarely/never use their pick up service. If I'm staying for a longer duration or know that I am stopping by, I'll take this into consideration!Overall, great sandwiches paired with great service. And every order comes with a caramel apple lollipop!PS: If you live in SoCal like I do, there's actually an Ike's at UCLA! I haven't been there yet but I intend to when I'm nearby/visiting!
Lots of great vegetarian options! I got the "Sometimes I'm a vegetarian" on sourdough and it was delicious. Very big and filling. Nowhere to sit so you have to bring it home or to the park.I ordered online for a 12:30pm pickup and the sandwiches weren't ready until 12:50. Friendly staff, though. Long line so consider ordering online!
Writing this review from inside Ike's where I'm closing in on 30 minutes waiting for TWO sandwiches. I've had Ike's before and the sandwiches are really good but hard to say they are worth committing an afternoon too.If you are going to go for Ike's, best bet is the Postmates or Doordash route. Or bring a lunch to eat while you wait for your lunch.
Reviewed the wrong place. I will be here tomorrow with an updated review.
The hype over the menage a trois sandwich is real guys, let me tell you. On the dutch bread! Crispy outside, soft and chewy inside. Come during happy hour (3-6pm on the weekdays) to get a free water and bag of chips. There isn't much seating aside from the booths along the window but it's not too far of a walk from Dolores park if you'd like a view of the city while you eat (which I love). There way too many sandwiches to choose from (I think he said 400+) who has time to read through all of that if there really is a menu listing all of it. But the popular ones seem to be on the chalkboard so I'd be down to try some more. It's just gonna be pretty hard to steer away from getting the menage a trois again lol
SO GOOD. I've been to Ike's over and over again and for good reason. It never disappoints. I've gotten the Matt Cain, the Spiffy Tiffy, the SF Giants, the manage a trois and many more. I've been to several location but the original one in San Francisco is my favorite. The line goes quickly and all the workers are very friendly! Make sure to bring cash to get a free bag of chips/drink and don't forget to ask for extra dirty sauce.
The sandwiches here are bomb!!!! I looooove them! Best sandwich I've ever had! The cashier was very patient and kind even though the line for this place is always out the door! Expect to wait a long time in line and about 40 minutes for your food! But its worth it! They literally have hundreds of different sandwiches to choose from! They are pricey but you do get your moneys worth!
The Kryptonite was the best fucking sandwich I've ever had in my life. Thank you Ike for creating that masterpiece.
I can't believe I haven't reviewed Ike's. What is wrong with me?! I don't need to add to the million and a half reviews, but Ike's sandwiches are bomb.com. Love their super Mario, Matt Cain, and veggie sandwich. Generous portion and their sauces are amazing. Love the voodoo chips to go with the meal. Pick up a sandwich and a bag of chips and head to Dolores park. Go to birite after for ice cream. There is your perfect afternoon.
Probably the best sandwich I've ever had. Cannot compare with Subway even though it's pretty similar in a way. $13 for a Spiffy Tiffy was worth my money I guess only because it was just so yum! Wait was lowkey long with limited seats for you to sit & wait too. I wouldn't really complain about the wait tho because there is like 6 or 7 people making sandwiches & 1 cashier outside, plus the many people coming in.
What can I say about Ike's? Let me start off by telling you that about 4 years ago there were rumors about this place closing down. My friend and I decided to go get our last sandwich as the whole city was in mourning over this loss. We then waiting in line for over 4 hours on a warm Sunday. Yes, it is that good! This alone should convince you to go here. Oh and the line was all the way down the block and around the corner. Much less did we find out they were not closing, simply moving up the street haha. Happiness was restored. Honestly, I'm not much of a sandwich person but this place is legit. First of all its hella local. Many of the sandwich are named after neighborhoods or SF Giants players, which makes me immediately love it. The choices are endless. It will take you quite a while to figure out what superb sandwich you wish to enjoy that day. Tips:-Grab and go. No seating. Grab a sandwich, take it to Dolores Park, which is a few blocks away and enjoy. -Come prepared to wait. There is a line because it is good. Do not be surprised by this and do not pass it by because of this.-They have gluten free bread! -The sandwiches are huge so be prepared to eat!-If you don't know what you want (speaking from experience) you can ask the staff and they're very happy to help you decide and help you figure out details such as what bread goes good with what sandwich. -The sandwiches are messy. Grab some napkinsNow go stuff your face with a delicious Ike's sandwich :)
Their dirty sauce is amazing, all their other ingredients are up to par with other sandwich joints, nothing too special. However this has got to be the slowest service in the world. It took us 15 minutes waiting in line.... With only two people in front of us. The guy taking orders took his sweet time conversing with the staff and customers. I'm all for customer service but damn, it does not take 5+ minutes to take someone's order.
Ordered the famous "mnage a trois" and a "Forty?!". We were bummed that they were out of their Dutch crunch - but we had no complaints about their yummy French bread. The famed "mnage" 'wich was not as good as it was hyped up to be! I have no one to blame but myself for that. It clearly had both honey and BBQ sauce but overall way too sweet for my personal taste. The "Forty" was totally bomb through and through (the one with the chicken fried steak). Pretty sure it was soy meat and totally delicious at that. We ordered ranch on top of their dirty sauce and it was an extra saucy delight. The menu is extensive which made the decision tough! Overall happy campers.
"Dude, it's just a sandwich. How can it be that good?" Oh ho ho. Allow me to explain.Just as In N Out reinvented the burger, so Ike reinvented the sandwich. Everything here is nothing short of extraordinary, and given that this location is the OG makes it even better. EVERYTHING is good here--I usually get the Bella--but whatever you get, just make sure you get it on Dutch Crunch! They only display a few highlights from the menu, so if you want to see all of their offerings, go to their website from your phone.Ike's sandwiches tend to be very saucy and heavy, but oh so delicious. Each half of the sandwich makes me about 60% full, so after the first half, I'm definitely satiated and I tell myself I should stop eating. However, the sandwiches are just so irresistibly good that I inevitably cave and eat the other half, at which point I am 120% full and super uncomfortable. So be warned--you'll feel like you just ate a bowling ball if you do end up finishing a sandwich in one sitting. Naps are highly encouraged to treat the ensuing food coma.The caramel apple pop they throw in is always the perfect way to close a meal. Try stuffing the sandwiches with Voodoo potato chips, too!
Two stars because the sandwiches are always a 5! Customer service however a 1 As I was ordering my sandwiches I asked the server how come they don't answer the phone and that I had been trying to call for 20 minutes. And he told me that in this day and age I should do it via an app.Totally rude and I will find another sandwich shop. I might add that when I came in he was only helping for customers that you already place the order in my opinion plenty of time to answer a phone.After looking at other reviews, i'm finding I'm the only one that thinks the bearded man at the register is completely rude.
I will always appreciate my first Ike's.I will always appreciate Ike's extensive menu.I will always appreciate Ike's willingness to accommodate vegans and gluten-free eaters.But I am over Ike's.The wait for a sandwich is insane and the end result just isn't worth it.I couldn't finish my sandwich this weekend. It just didn't taste that great. Even when I wiped off the mayonaise which I had requested not to be on it, and I added the ingredients from my fridge which they had forgotten (despite me paying extra for them) to add to it -  I just wasn't feeling my lukewarm soggy sub.I will always appreciate Ike's for paving the way for so many other unique sandwich eateries in SF - but I think I'd rather skip the lines and the botched orders and get a lovely sandwich from Haight Street Market instead.Trust.
Lived up to the hype. The mnage a trois and Matt Cain on Dutch crunch were both delicious. The mnage a trois has a sweet savory taste. Would definitely go again!
This is a place for extreme dishes. it was quiet sometime that I haven't visited this place but until now this place is my choice. Thus, you should try this spot, if you wanna know this place better. I guaranteed fresh sandwiches and kind service, portion is huge. Yet, sometimes you have to wait for a while before having your order.
A sandwich jam packed with flavor at a great price. I've tried several different sandwiches and have never been disappointed.
Believe the reviews this place is that GOOD! The nacho boy on crunch bread is unreal. Everything was really fresh and the wait wasn't bad for 12PM. They also have an app but I didn't get to try it out. I highly recommend this place!
Whooow!!!!!! This sandwich was delish. My cousin had been raving about this sandwich shop in Castro that had great sandwiches. I had the backstabber and its was awesome. I WANT ONE NOW!!!! My kid had a grilled cheese and enjoyed it as well. I would have given them 5 stars if it wasn't for service. We delt with 4 different workers.2 were nice and helpful and the other two were plain rude. Some worker laughed at my kids name "Brett" wtf is funny about that?? Maybe because he's a little Hispanic boy but still I felt like punching him in the face. (Mom rant done)
Sandwiches are good depending on what you get. My review is about the wait time. I ordered my sandwich in line (yes maybe I should have called it in but let's be real you can't always be prepared for everything) with the guarantee that my order will be out in 10mins. I am writing this review as I have been waiting over an hour for my sandwich. Could have gotten my PhD and have had a big family with these wait times.I will not return for lunch or rush hour unless I love waiting.
Sandwiches are good. However, the service is horrible. The wait is so long and they just don't care. I ordered through Eat 24 at 2:45 and it said pickup at 3:32. I left without my sandwiches at 4:00. This has been pretty much the case every time I have gone to this location. You can see into the kitchen and people are just walking around and chatting. I watched people who were in line to order when I got there leave with their food as I kept being told it would be 5 to 10 mins for mine. And they kept saying "We tell Yelp to say it's going to be an hour wait." I wasn't told an hour and even if I had been, I waited over an hour and still didn't get my food. The sandwiches are not worth the frustration.
Eating here always remind me why I love sandwiches so much! Though the full menu of sandos are not displayed on the board inside, you can still order your favorite/something that isn't listed! My sisters and I came here on a Saturday afternoon and the line reached the door. We only had to wait about 10 min in line before ordering and we even got to meet the owner! My favorite to get is the "Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian"--love the mushrooms and pesto+provolone mix. I add in jalapenos to the mix to give it a spicy kick and it's always freakin satisfying! One half of a sandwich gets my tummy filled but if I'm super hungry I'll go for the full thing. The menu is so diverse, I think there's something on the menu for everyone! After you order and pay, you wait another 10ish minutes before you name is called--and voila--sandwich in hand, you can either eat on the bench inside the store or take a quick walk to Dolores Park and eat right there!Overall, if you wanna try some freakin tasty sandwiches in the bay, come here!!
Even before I moved to the bay, everyone told me that Ike's was a must-try. I finally tried their mnage a trois with a Dutch crunch roll, dirty sauce, red onions, and banana peppers. My girlfriend and I wanted to take it to Dolores park for a picnic, but we couldn't resist snagging a few bites of our freshly made sandwich before our walk to the park. I definitely recommend eating it as soon as your order's ready if you want the full experience. We managed to save half our sandwich for our picnic, but it no longer maintained its oomph -- it was a little on the soggy side and it lost some of its freshness. Despite all the rave reviews, i was a little hesitant to try this place since I'm not a huge sandwich person but even I have to admit that this place rocks and is as deserving of all the praise it receives.
Finally. 9 months in this city and I've finally eaten an Ike's sandwich! I feel I may have opened the flood gates because I can't wait to get back and try more delicious items on the menu. We waited in line for about 30 minutes on a Saturday afternoon. I now know after that experience that you can order online for pick-up and skip the entire line. This is without a DOUBT the way to go! It's like when you get to be in the car-pool lane going over the bay bridge during rush hour, suckers! I ordered the Hot Mamma Huda on dutch crunch. This was my first munch on a dutch crunch and it did not disappoint. This sandwich has the dirty sauce, ranch and buffalo sauce with chicken. Throw some mozzarella sticks on it and call it the Cougar. Yummm, I'm drooling just going down memory lane over here. I know that the menu is quite extensive and that there are many sandwich options that aren't always on the board. I guess I need to do my research!I also had the pleasure of meeting Ike himself while I was in. He is an extremely friendly guy and was just delivering sandwiches to everyone waiting. I find it really cool when successful business owners still want to spend their Saturday helping out in the stores. He was shaking hands and thanking people for coming in, it was great! I will be back many many more times.
I came here on a Thursday right around 3PM so there was hardly a line. I was told that there was a "secret" menu as well; and to my fortune, a quick Google search provided me with the entire list! It's almost impossible to decide on a single sandwich (you'll definitely want to come again for another choice). They have a huge menu offering so you can be sure that there is something there for everyone. They also serve sides on certain days with specific tmes.At first glance, the shop seemed too small to really impress any passerby. Not much to see on the inside but some benches along the wall, a couple of bathroom stalls, a register with various impulsive purchases, and a cold beverage refrigerator stickered with many projects.I decided on #107 "If I Were Cute!" on dutch (Bravo, by the way, on the names of sandwiches) which included halal chicken, mozzarella sticks, bacon, pesto, ranch, and cheddar. I took one bite and I could not help but moan from the pleasurable sensation that my taste buds were experiencing. The sandwich stayed together with each bite; I was pleasantly surprised that it did not fall apart! Crispy, crunchy, and savory with buttery and smooth following suit. It was one of those meals where I intended to save the second half for later but my will power was tested and failed. I was completely satisfied. The perfect sandwich.A must go to for visitors. You'll definitely find me at this establishment again.
6000+ reviews and a 4.5 star rating more than confirms that Ike's Place is serving up some amazing sandwiches. The only downside to this place is picking a single sandwich from the many, many sandwiches they offer. My friend and I split a Super Mario (meatball with mozzarella sticks) and a Hot Momma Huda (chicken with buffalo sauce). Both were amazing. Great bread and great ingredients resulting in great sandwich synergy. The Huda is named after Ike's mom. To raise such a maestro of sandwich-making, she must be one amazing lady!Now to live in the dilemma that is trying a new sandwich or continuing to eat the sandwiches I love. Life is truly difficult sometimes...
I have been going here since before I had a gluten free diet and was so excited to still enjoy their delicious sandwiches even when I did turn gluten free. The sauces are amazing, the bread is always fresh, they are fast and just all around a great sandwich shop, no matter what your tastes are you will not be disappointed with your selection
I like Ike('s sandwiches)! Grab yourself a gigantic sandwich and lug it over to Dolores Park for optimal enjoyment.The reviews advised me to go online and research my options beforehand since there are so many. The menu is chock full of interesting names and tasty ingredients - it was basically sandwich porn for me. The website is also amazingly organized, you can even filter by ingredient to help narrow it down!I ordered the Back Stabber which is chicken with artichoke hearts. I got it on their famous Dutch Crunch and was not disappointed. $10 covered both of my meals for the day. WIN.
Not my favorite sandwich spot in the city, but definitely tasty. I like Rhea's a bit more, especially in price comparison. Ike's like all these other hippie sandwich places is expensive. I get that the quality is high, but damn $40 for two sandwiches and chips. Holy cow! Not mad about it, just meh.
Ree-Donk-ulous! My lips pull into a smile the first time I see it, my sammie, an homage to Thanksgiving. My tongue touches the sour dough and my taste buds leap. My jaw closes and I masticate, shamelessly! OMG Ike & crew, I am gobsmacked and humbled. Palates have made this sandwich, clever, seasoned palates, people who know mega nom nom. Beyond yum!
I love Ike's Place, it's the perfect spot for lunch. Usually the line is pretty long during lunch time and the sandwiches take a while also. I wouldn't recommend going if you're in a time crunch.Hot Mama Huda is the best sandwich they have...
Ike's always has been and will be my favorite place for a sandwich. The selection is enormous so there's also something for everyone. Although the prices are a bit higher than I would normally pay for a sandwich, the portions are pretty big and the quality of the sandwich completely justify them. I got the "Going Home for Thanksgiving", which had turkey, cranberry sauce, havarti cheese, and sriracha (I asked them to go easy) on wheat bread with lettuce and tomato, and I honestly don't understand how something sounding so simple could make me as happy as it did. I always tell my friends I'm down for Ike's any day because it's so true.The employees made me feel welcome and did not give off the "I'm being forced to make conversation with you for customer's service's sake" feel, and seemed happy to be working there, which definitely earns them extra points.Be sure to check out their other locations as well since the selections vary between them!
ORDER ONLINE. I went online right when they opened at 10am, and I was already in their 11:15am pickup slot. Online ordering is so easy and you can peruse the GIANT menu for as long as you want. Seriously, there are way too many sandwiches to choose from. I felt so much pressure to pick the "right" one!We ended up getting the Menage a Trois and Spiffy Tiffy both on Dutch Crunch bread. (For anyone who hasn't had Dutch Crunch- imagine corn flakes baked on the top of bread...)Both sandwiches were awesome. My favorite though was the Menage a Trois, because it's the perfect sandwich for sweet and savory lovers. Just look at the ingredients...BBQ, Cheddar, Halal Chicken, Honey Mustard, Pepper Jack, Real Honey, SwissSpiffy Tiffy was also a quality choice, but just more boring in my opinion with chicken, avocado, pesto, veggies, and cheese.I think all sandwiches come with the dirty sauce. I'm still not sure what that is, but the sandwiches tasted good, so I'm guessing it's a good sauce..?Sandwiches are around $11-14 each, but they are huge. I could definitely get two meals out of it. Although, you may not want to, since it gets all soggy and stuff.
Did like this place once upon a time, but will be losing my business. We ordered online and it said 10-35 mins... That's real specific. So we walked over calmly, arrived, and according to the online ordering app, it was just another 16 mins Max. It has been an hour. Someone needs to look at lean processing
It almost feels wrong to call this a "sandwich place" - Ike's sandwiches are so much more than a sandwich. Outrageous creations, great ingredients, and perfect bread. Can't get much better than Ike's. First of all, their "Dutch Crunch" bread is beyond anything you've ever had. Think about it like garlic bread on steroids. Every sandwich here should be gotten with this bread.My personal favorite is the Barry B.: Bacon, Swiss, Turkey. But I don't stop there. I ad avocado, habanero salsa, and jalapeo poppers. Yes, jalapeo poppers. On the sandwich. It sounds odd, but the crunchy, spicy, cheesy goodness of them works perfectly with the sandwich. I make sure to stop by Ike's every time I'm in SF. They are big sandwiches, they are creative sandwiches, and they are the best sandwiches I've ever had.
Ike's is certainly a San Francisco (and Bay Area) institution that's recognized even beyond the Bay Area, and I have tremendous respect for that. I've been coming here since I was in high school, and it's always been a treat to get ahold of an Ike's sandwich. I'm well aware that this location is extremely popular, and I always anticipate long wait times. Normally, I try to avoid this by calling in my order or purchasing it through the FB app.However, my most recent trip to Ike's left a bitter taste in my mouth that no Ike's sandwich could neutralize. We placed a decent sized order (7 sandwiches) to pick up at 12:15pm on a Friday via the FB app. I anticipated having to wait a little beyond the scheduled pickup time to receive the order, but I think there comes a point where waiting for nearly one hour after the scheduled pickup time is unacceptable. When I arrived, I was the first patron in line in the phone/online order line. The person operating the cash register said it would be approximately 15-20 more minutes. That's perfectly reasonable for a busy Friday, I thought. After the 20 minutes had passed, and I checked in with another person working the cash register. I was told my order was "half way done." I figured, that shouldn't be too much longer. I sure was wrong - I ended up waiting about 53 minutes from when I initially arrived/checked in to get my order.To add insult to injury, there were several patrons that had ordered via phone or by the app with a later pickup time received their orders BEFORE mine. Admittedly these were smaller orders - but nonetheless, it was mind boggling and made little sense to me as to why an order that was nearly 45 minutes overdue the scheduled pickup time was not prioritized after checking in with them about the status of my order a couple of times?If I have a 12:15PM pickup, why are there 5-6 people with LATER pickup times, receiving their orders before mine? I'm not sure if the sandwiches for this order were just sitting there, or what, because after checking in at around 1:08PM and being visibly frustrated, I finally received my order.Ike's does make great sandwiches, no doubt, and I think it's awesome that they make tributes to Bay Area athletes (Ronnie Lott, Cain, Lincecum, Steph Curry, Harrison Barnes, Zito, etc.) but I don't know if it's worth waiting exorbitant wait times for these sandwiches. Or at least, I'd hope that there could be improvements made to the app to be more realistic about the scheduled pickup times. I wouldn't be motivated to write this review if the app did not allow us to select a 12:15PM pickup time and instead made the 1:15PM pickup time as the earliest option. In the mean time, I'll be going to grab sandwiches at Roxie's (another San Francisco institution) instead.TL;DR: Good sandwiches, long wait times, questionable queue prioritization based on experience w/ app, sad Jared.
So, I love the mnage a trois sandwich but it almost always makes my stomach hurt :( I dunno why. It's really tasty (bbq and honey seasoning yes please) so I end up ordering it anyway. But I wish there were a half size option.Service here is friendly and they have lots of sandwich options. Try the voodoo chips too! They throw in caramel apple pops too....so nostalgic.
After reading positive reviews on Yelp I Called Ike's today 3/1/15 at 4:30pm to order a "menajahtwa" or menage a trois (sex related food? Eww 1st bad sign)I was told my order would be ready at 5pm...After a 20min drive and a 10 min wait while illegally parked, I entered Ike's, made an inquiry with the cashier about my sandwich... She ringup 12.96 went to the back and returned with a arm full of bagged sandwiches, then she went back again and returned with another load of sandwiches and distributed to waiting patrons .... So I asked was mines ready?? I had a 5pm pickup and its now 5:20!!!She replys , NO its not ready!!! Did this dimwited of a brainless woman offer me an apology ? or something for waiting??? Nooooooo !! She didn't care!! So I left. When i first arrived in the area I got a bad vibe from my surroundings, then come walking down the street, naked men without a stitch of clothing whatttttt!!!That confirmed the negative feelings I had while waiting in my car, I also saw other very dark things happening in that area. When the rude wacky cashierTold me my food wasn't ready I counted it a blessing and got out of that cursed area.
This sandwich joint is awesome. I came here on a Thursday at around 4pm - no line (YES!). Their menu list is extensive (and the names of the sandwiches are very witty!), so looking at yelp to get an idea of what you're in the mood for will help you decide faster. I got the Meatless Mike Sandwich, which consists of vegan meatball and cheese and marinara,with their famous Dutch Crunch bread and omg, this sandwich is pretty much perfect. Great crunch on the bread, the meatball were seasoned well with abundance of herbs and spices, the sauce soaked nicely into the bread, and the cabbage and tomatoes brought great freshness to the sandwich. AMAZING. I ate half of the sandwich and was soooo full. My boyfriend order the Pride of Castro Sandwich which consists of brie, ham, and turkey, and he thought the sandwich was delicious as well. Must go to this place if you're visiting the bay area.
Turkey cranberry sandwich was tasty but too wet (several sauces dilute any strong, single flavor.Reuben meat was thick and seasoned well, with great cole slaw.No credit cards, but downliad an app and link ur checking acct for $20 free.
Over priced. Tuna sandwich (Tony Stark) wasn't better than a regular subway tuna sandwich. Didn't live up to the hype. Basic sandwich, nothing special.
All I have to say is WOW! I have been hearing about this place for months and i am so excited I finally got to try it. Me and some friends came on a Wednesday at about 11:30am. There was only 5 people in front of us which is amazing because I hear the line can get huge! It took me about 15 minutes just to decide what to get. Finally I settled with the Matt Cain, added Jals and Avo on dutch crunch. We walked to Dolores Park to eat and the first bite put a huge smile on my face. It was so good and the sauce is what makes it. I was so full but somehow finished it all. I will obviously be back and hopefully sooner than later.
After being continuously recommended (and reminded) to try Ike's, my friend and I made the trip for a mnage a trois on Dutch Crunch, with avocado. (Side note: some extras are quite pricey, $2 for avocado so if you want something in your sandwich, look for a variation with it - there are over 200 sandwiches on the menu). It was amazing, the honey in the mnage did some real good complementing the halal chicken. The sauce was amazing too, though it did get a bit soggy towards the end (kind of hard not to). Met Ike - chill guy, very friendly, thanked us for coming and agreed to a selfie with us! Overall worth the hike from the BART.
People here complain about how they've been hung up on, put on hold, etc etc, but if they knew what was really happening at Ike's, I think it would make sense to give the employees a little break.I called in and ordered over the phone. When I got inside, I thought I had to wait in line to pay (IF YOU DO ORDER BY PHONE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE. JUST GO UP TO THE SIDE COUNTER AND PAY THERE!). One employee was taking orders for the people in line. The other employee was juggling not 1, not 2, but 3 phones simultaneously. The phones were ringing non-stop. It was literally: pick up phone, take order, done... pick up phone, take order, done... repeat x100000000. Let's be nice to one another, everybody.
The sandwiches were really good. The line ups thou.. Was very long!! Prices were slightly on the pricier side but knowing that you are paying more for the good sandwich kind of justifies it. Overall good experience when you are around the neighbourhood and have few hours to kill.
I really, really want to write a descriptive review for this place, but I can't because I ate here last weekend during my visit up to San Francisco. I got the Robbin Williams. I wish I could tell you what was in it....if I remember correctly, it was gyro chicken, and some stuff and mushrooms! It was so good. I would pick this sandwich place over any other any day. Sorry for the crap review, but wanted to share how satisfied I was with my sandwich :) Oh! And during their lunch hours, your sandwich comes with a free bag of chips and soda.
I am also one of those who just doesn't get it. I came here in the late afternoon with my boo as I was starving - was hoping the line wasn't too long because my stomach was already eating itself. We waited for an hour. It was one of those back and forth thoughts of "should we leave?" "should we not leave?" We'd already invested too much time now, so that was it. After being indecisive for the entire wait, I ended up choosing the Jaymee Sirewich that is filled with fried chicken, Ike's yellow BBQ, pepper jack cheese, and ranch dressing. I wanted the Dutch Crunch bread as you're expected to do, but of course they were out. We waited to eat our sandwiches at home, since, as you know, there's no space there. So I finally got home unraveled this package and was disappointed. They mixed ingredients between my sandwich and my partner's sandwich. He wanted peppers and they put it in mine instead. It was filled with sauces - just completely overloaded. I couldn't even taste the chicken. These sandwiches are not worth the wait at all. I'm unimpressed because if you douse anything with heavy fat and mayonnaise based sauces, it will make everything taste like fat and mayonnaise. If you overload with these sauces, you just have a ton of soaked bread. I've said it before. As a northeastener, there's something to be said about the Jersey sub and we need some more perspective on sandwiches out here. Yes, it's mostly hype.
Why are there snadwiches much smaller and much more expensive then before? Im defiantly going to Yellow Sub or Merigas or Little Lucas instead. Not worth the price tag sorry.
Love the sandwiches but the attitude of the employees at the front counter when I come in can be a bit much! I mean come on I'm spending a pretty penny on the food and Im in a rush myself to get lunch and go back to work. The last thing I want is to be ignored while in line and then when I do get up to the cashier be thrown attitude........
Yum!!! I've tried so many of their sandwiches but the ones I can't get enough of is the Elvis Keith + Avocado! If you're hoping for a quick stop, you should pre call in your order! The lines are long!!!
Be prepared to wait, unless you were smart enough to call your order in, which I highly recommend.The sandwiches I've had from here are:Paul Reubens - which consists of French Dressing, HomeMade Poppy Seed Coleslaw, Pastrami, Swiss. Pastrami wasn't a sodium bomb and the sandwich was very tasty. One of my favorite variations of a Reuben.Matt Cain - which consisted of Godfather Sauce, Provolone, Roast Beef, Salami, Turkey. Really good mix of meats paired with the sauce and cheese. I enjoyed stuffing this into my pie hole.I have to try more of the sandwiches and also try "Dutch Crunch" if they still have some.
Free chips. The best sammiches ever!!!!!! My fav is the buffalo sandwich on dutch crunch with jalapeo chips! This place is a must try!It's a take out sammy spot but if you have a huge order, I'd call it in and pick up? There's one short ledge and 2-3 chairs to sit and eat but what I do is get my sammies and sit on the back of my truck and enjoy while I people watch. :)
This was a really poor choice on my part. I ordered the tri tip sandwich, I believe (forgot the fancy name). Anyways, waited 20 minutes in line to order, nbd they seem popular... However, while waiting I noticed that they had a full assembly line of people putting together the sandwiches in the back and was slightly alarmed to see all the different types of sandwiches being PRE-ASSEMBLED and staged.... They aren't made to order wtf? Proceeded to wait an HOUR from the time I placed the order at 2:15 pm on a Sunday (which is generally not a busy time to eat), and I was starving by the time they finally called my name. I thought it was dumb how many delivery orders they filled while waiting. Got a SOGGY, lame sandwich to show for all the time I wasted... Barf!! I didn't even want to finish it. There was absolutely nothing special about it. I'd rather buy one from Subway or Togos, and I don't even eat there. I really think they should stop doing delivery orders because they can't handle the additional business. If they just focused on the people who cared to wait in line, maybe they could keep up with the hype. Never again...
If love were a sandwich, it'd be one of Ike's.I need to emphasize here that as a lifelong vegetarian, Ike's is the best sandwich spot I've ever had the privilege of eating at. They have a ton of vegetarian and vegan options, and those options feature vegan faux meats. The first time I went to Ike's was the first time I went to a sandwich restaurant and felt truly welcomed.Let's be real: most restaurants don't care about vegetarians. Those restaurants will tack on one or two mediocre veggie options. Those sandwiches will certainly not have vegan faux meats to ensure vegetarians and vegans enjoy a substantive sandwich. Ike's is the opposite. The quality and quantity available for vegetarians is why I'll forever rank it above decent spots like Lou's Caf on 14th and Geary, which some people tout as better than Ike's.Just so I don't leave you empty-handed for reading this review, I'd recommend a Tom Brady sandwich. It comes with avocado, cheddar, garlic and herb sauce, mushrooms, vegan breaded chicken. The vegan breaded chicken is delightful. This is my staple sandwich, but you really can't go wrong with anything on their menu.I don't care that Ike's is small or that there are rarely any seats. I go to Ike's because their food is great and their menu shows they care about serving people like me. That goes a long way. I noticed, Ike.
What's so special about their sandwiches? I liked it, but would never go out of my way to go get an Ike's Place sandwich. I got the Dameon Bruce and my boyfriend got the Menage a Trois. I took a bite from both and both tasted the same. Even though they had completely different ingredients, Ike's "dirty sauce" overpowers everything. Not necessarily a bad thing for those who love the sauce, but I didn't care for it. Oh and it took 40 minutes for my sandwich. But over-hyped places usually have over-hyped waits. Meh.
When I first heard of Ike's I thought, "I have to go!!!" Then I stayed a yelper for a few years and learned a lot of places on yelp are completely overrated and just hype. So my eagerness to try Ike's dwindled, to the point that I no longer cared to come when in SF. Buuuut finally in SF with Pinky and trying to give him a true SF experience I decided I'd make the stop to Ike's with him before heading to Napa. Woooow, Ike's I'm sorry I dismissed you for so long. This place is the place that will ruin sandwiches for you. I know because Pinky and I have tried eating sandwiches elsewhere and it just doesn't even compare so that now Pinky always reminisces back to his sandwich from Ike's. Dutch crunch bread, so tasty I'm afraid to go anywhere else in So Cal claiming to have it bc I don't want to be disappointed. Habanero sauce, a must for spicy eaters like Pinky and I.Pinky and I ordered our own sandwiches and switched off to taste each other's... What we like about Ike's sandwiches is the moistness from the meats and sauces used, while not being gross soggy. I ate my other half about 2 hours later and it was still tasty though a little softer from the moisture. Free chips too?!?! Stop reading and just go!
The cashier seemed incredibly rushed--the line wasn't very long at all but she was running around all over the place, like she was in a panic. I asked for onions--twice--and didn't get any. Perhaps Ikes should better train their employees to handle stressful situations. The sandwich was still very good, as usual. I used the Kash app and got $5 off, which was nice. I only wish they had their bottled root beer in stock.
Had to stop here on our trip to SF, based on the reviews. I was a little surprised when we walked in--just a bench by the window for people waiting for orders, but no actual tables. We went around 2pm on a Wednesday. We waited for the sandwiches longer than we waited in line, and our total time there was less than 30 minutes.My husband got the "Sometimes I'm Vegan" on dutch crunch and added banana peppers. I ordered the "Pilgrim" on dutch crunch. Both were awwwwesome. The second part of my sandwich was a bit messier than the first because the bread had started to get a little soggy from all the dressing. I think these are best eaten fresh. Yes, there are many choices--check the online menu first, if you can, because the in-store menu is much smaller. Also, there may be three names for what is basically the same sandwich--one for regular meat and cheese, one with vegan meat but dairy cheese, and one with both vegan meat and vegan cheese. This kind of helps narrow your choices down. Just pick which toppings you want and tell the counter person if you want it veggie or vegan.The two counter people when we were there were nice, the guy a bit more knowledgeable than the girl, but he seemed more "in charge," too. Either way, pleasant customer service with no attitude.We also picked up a butterscotch root beer, which was delicious. No chips for us, but they did give us two caramel apple pops for free. The bathroom was unisex, and looked a little questionable in terms of cleanliness for us ladies. I was glad I didn't need to use it.Other yelpers have commented on the neighborhood. Ike's shares a block with a school, so I felt perfectly safe parking about two blocks away and walking over and back (and there are definitely places in SF I would not feel comfortable doing that). The neighborhood was pretty quiet during the time we were there.The sandwiches were five star; one star off for no real seating and a bathroom I wouldn't want to use. I almost would prefer to go to three and a half stars for that, but the sandwiches really do pop it up to four. Just know before you go. ;)
Visited SF for a few days and this place was highly recommended by a friend, so I had to try it. Hands down one of the best sandwiches I've had- I ordered the Menage a trois, a slightly sweet chicken sandwich loaded with sauces and cheese. There weren't any tables inside so I had to sit on a bench to eat, but the sandwich was so enjoyable that I didn't mind at all! Service was friendly and we came right before the dinner, so got our food pretty quickly as well!
The best favor you can do yourself is to call at least 20 mins ahead to place an order for pick up. Otherwise you'll be stuck in a lengthy line that will take awhile, especially during lunch hours.The menu is pretty vast, catering to all taste buds with fun sandwich names. It's fun hearing Tim Lincecum and Menage Trios called out loud in the same order.A few of my favorites are the Menage Trois, Spiffy Tiffy and one that I've recently tried the Backstabber. All so tasty and I just always get em on dutch crunch bread. All sandwiches come with the infamous dirty sauce so don't worry and they'll make sure you're ok with lettuce and tomato on top. Good selection of cold bottled beverages that you typically won't find in most sandwich spots like Shirley Temples, Root Beer, Bubble Up, Calypso Lemonades, etc. Perfect to wash down your hefty sandwich!One half will get me pretty full, even if I'm tempted to eat more of it. It's not the best with saving for later cuz the sauce will get the bread a little soggy but the taste will definitely still be there. Ike's is a good twist to make sandwiches for lunch more exciting and tasty. It may be overload for me to have too often though.
Love Ike's Sandwiches, especially their Doomsday Sandwich. This place just about ruined every sandwich place for me. It's just that good! Tip: Call and put your order in for pick up to avoid long lines!
The sandwiches were delicious!! We were here on a Friday afternoon around 2:15. Line was short and waited about 15 minutes for the sandwiches!
Best sandwich I've ever had. It's the sandwich equivalent of tacos from Oscars in San Diego to me which is the highest honor in my book. My friend and I went and decided to share a menage a trois. Half the sandwich was plenty for the both of us. The service was great, our cashier was very friendly and helped us order. Our sandwich came with caramel apple lollipops. Overall, I just had a really great experience and will definitely be going to the location in Los Angeles!
I came in by accident noticing the long lines and decided to try it. I was certainly not disappointed! I had the Matt Cain sandwich, a roast beef and salami sandwich, and it tasted far better than expected. There were many more good choices that I'll have to save for next time. Be aware though, there's not much eating space and waits can be about 30 minutes and over after placing your order in line.
I've been to Ike's a lot, but insanely Slow service today.. 45 minutes and still waiting.. There were only three people ahead of me..Usually I've waited inside of 15 minutes at worst. I'm going to have to reconsider this place as a regular lunch spot.While their sandwiches are great, I'm not so sure I'll be back to this place anytime soon, especially given a snippy response from the guy here behind the counter.Moral of the story: don't get stuck behind a large order like the two dozen people/victims here today.
I don't think anyone will be surprised that this was the best sandwich I have ever had!! They know what they are doing, and they do it well!!! I had heard the wait would be super long, and we went not long before closing. It wasn't bad at all, and the food was unbelievable!! We tried 4 different sandwiches between the group of people I went with. Every single one of them as beyond anything I have ever dreamed of!! The staff were super friendly and the food was hot and fresh. Not the best place for kids or strollers, but we made it work. Also, much easier if you get it to go.
This location has been the easiest for me to find parking at. The store itself is small, but there are long benches along the walls to use to eat or wait for your sandwich on. During the busier hours I'd suggest taking your sandwich to-go as it is uncomfortable with the long lines and everyone hovering over you as you eat. Also the seating area becomes very dirty during the lunch rush.Because they get so busy it is easy to feel rushed when ordering which makes it easy to forget something you wanted added or changed; so if you're someone like me, who has a modification or two to make, then it may be best for you to either write it down or not to go during rush lunch hours.The sandwiches are on the pricer end but do taste great. They do take a little longer to make than one would expect a sandwich would take, but that's how they do things.
Ike's. You never do me wrong. NEVER. My friends and I went to Ike's after a long day of hiking and we all, unknowingly, ordered the "We're Just Friends" sandwiches. Halal chicken, orange glaze, dirty sauce, cheese, avocado? Heaven. Heaven. They were even great about cutting the sandwiches in half and wrapping them for us. The sandwiches were great, even though we couldn't eat them until 25 minutes later. Ike's doesn't need another review, but it deserves one. Great place for great quality sandwiches.
Sandwiches are good but they can't handle the volume of customers so I guess the customers are going to have to start dockng them a few points for having to wait forever and ever and ever and ever. Also when u call, they don't answer the phone half the time until the 50th ring: they can't even hire an extra hand to just handle the call volume.It's experiences like these that make you wonder whether your being played a fool by the hype, forced to wait in lines so you can give them your money and time in return for some short term sandwich decadence. The only problem is that their sandwiches aren't even that decadent. Don't get me wrong though, their sandwiches are good, tending on the unhealthy side - but nobody should wait that long for food, ever.Maybe they are proud for being so much in demand that their weekend lines snake outside their store, around the corner on busy days- they shouldn't be. Definiately not 4.5 star material just for this factor.
Got the number 6. Hot mama hoda? One of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. This place gets packed real quick. We got lucky and only had to wait 20 mins for our sandwiches. Really busy around lunch time. I love the Dutch Crunch bread. I would eat here again and wished they had it in chicago!
I think this is the same Ike's Place that I saw on Man vs Food. Same delicious sandwiches no matter which of their locations you go to. The only problem is that some locations take a long time to make your sandwich. Here it took them about 10 minutes which isn't that bad at all. Their Cupertino location is the fastest.I know I should of followed my own tip about using their app. I don't know why I didn't use it and I tell everyone to use the app.
Seriously, seriously delicious sandwiches. I got the Menage A Trois and could not have been more satisfied. They also offer a great happy hour deal that includes a free drink and bag of chips with your sandwich.
I have heard many good things about this place. And, the sandwiches were indeed phenomenal. The only reason this place gets 4 stars is that it doesn't have a place to sit or even wait for the sandwiches to be prepared.
Reviewing this place in comparison to the one by UCLA. This place is significantly better. I haven't been there in a while, but I think their sandwiches are overall better. The ambience, the location, the parking, everything is just better. Here, I always get the menege e trois and it has never disappointed! One of my favorite things to do is come here w friends and eat at Dolores park right up the block. A menege e trois last I remembered was around $12 so it's not the cheapest sandwich. It is really good though! It is definitely worth going to and bringing friends to try! Super good lunch.
Believe everything you read! This is definitely a must when you are visiting SF! Located within walking distance to Dolores Park. There is limited bench/chair seating inside and no table seating at all.The Matt Cain is a pretty popular option, but once I saw pesto on their Spiffy Tiffy (1/2), I just had to get it. It comes with your choice of bread, I got the Dutch Crunch, lettuce + tomato, and a bag of chips. The sandwiches here cost around $10 bucks but are HUGE! Once I opened my sandwich, I knew that only half of it would keep me satisfied. You could definitely share with 2 people. The Spiffy Tiffy is delicious! It comes with avocados, pesto sauce, chicken, mushroom, and cheese! I'd say it was 100% worth it, especially if you like avocados! Would get again!Voodoo potato chips were wonderful. I believe they are a combination of BBQ and salt + vinegar flavors. Yum!
Huge fan of their menage a trois, however I can never finished the whole sandwich because I get tired of how sweet it is from the mixture of BBQ sauce and honey. But the first bite is heaven... especially when it's warm and on dutch crunch bread.I'm sad to hear that they are no longer offering free chips with the sandwiches, that's actually kind of disappointing to me. Be ready to wait in line, and enjoy it while it's still warm!
What a let down. Waited over an hour for two sandwiches. Not exaggerating at all. The guy that works the counter must be fried out of his mind because he couldn't hold a convo, nor could he put in orders correctly. People that ordered far after us got their sandwiches first. Once my bf finally complained he's like, "yours is coming out next." It did, however, my bf's meatball sandwich was COLD! Such a bummer!! Mine was good because I was starving, but the worst service I have ever experienced!!!! he didn't even give us a sorry!!! Totally unacceptable.
Came here on a gorgeous day post-Dolores park (though grabbing a sandwich here to eat at the park would be a fantastic idea). Line wasn't so bad, nice atmosphere and vibe otherwise. Friendly service! I pulled the trigger on "We're Just Friends" on Dutch Crunch. Really, really good stuff. My girlfriend had incidentally picked the same one so now our relationship is questionable but this occurrence does not compare to the wonderful experience and deliciousness of my Ike's sandwich. Highly recommend. Also, the front steps of the neighboring house are off limits in terms of seating...though the church steps down the street makes a nice alternative.
Thank you, Ike, for giving me the pleasure of eating THE BEST SANDWICH OF MY LIFE.I've been wanting to try Ike's for more than a year now, and I finally wound up there yesterday (ironically only because I was hungry and didn't want to wait thirty minutes at Kitchen Story).I had no idea what to order, but the guys at the cash register were patient and helpful. I ultimately went with a menage a trois (abbreviated "3 xo" on my wrapper, which I thought was the cutest thing) + avocado on Dutch crunch, and my first bite confirmed it was the best sandwich I've ever had.Amazing, fresh combinations, cheeky names, friendly people, and a convenient location near Dolores Park. An Ike's sandwich, some good company, sunshine, and a picnic blanket make for a perfect afternoon in San Francisco.
Oh man this place was awesome! I was expecting a huge line but when we got there it was about three people in line. The cashier was very helper- she recommended some bomb choices. I traveled to San Fran for my birthday- I'm a foodie- so my BF chose some great spots to hit up and this place is definitely a place you NEED to try.
Ike's is apparently hipster heaven. Ya'll love to wait in long lines and eat what everyone else is eating and then rave about it, and somehow that makes you feel unique. I don't get it.Anyway, Ike's makes a good sandwich. It's hugely overpriced, and I would never, ever wait in a long line for one, but if you go at a slow time and don't mind spending twice what you ought to be spending for a SANDWICH, you'll probably enjoy what you get. But talk about overrated...I live only a couple blocks away and almost never go there, because it's a poor value and I have better things to do with my time than stand in line unnecessarily. But if that's your thing, hey, you'll love Ike's!Four stars for the sandwiches themselves, one star removed for the prices and another for the lines.On the other hand, props to Ike for managing to turn a fairly unremarkable sandwich into a very successful business with a number of locations. I'm sure you're laughing all the way to the bank, and you should be. Gotta love capitalism and the gullible masses.
What more can be said about a place that has possibly the highest yelp rating I've ever seen?I got the Tim Lincecum. It was amazing. Amazing in the, "how can something as simple as a sandwich really be this much better than every sandwich I've ever had?" sort of way. From what I can tell, the secret comes from their perfectly crispy yet soft bread and that dirty sauce. It manages to be a perfectly saucy sandwich that never gets soggy and maintains the perfect balance with every bite. Great sandwich that was a foodie high point of my San Francisco trip.
Best sandwich in the world! Worst customer service ever. Half an hour late food after placing an online order and the stoned lady at the register is yelling at me and asking me for 10 cents to give me a paper bag.
My favorite sandwich shop ever!! I always get the sometimes I'm a vegetarian and it never ever disappoints! It has been a long held tradition in which I get a sandwich from Ike's and then bring it to Dolores Park to eat. Also, the caramel apple lollipop is a great touch :)
Not sure why people bother waiting in line for this place, when you can order online and pickup. I guess the reason is that by the time you get home with your delicious sandwiches, they're a bit soggy from being loaded up with so much sauce / toppings /amazingness. Anyway, these sandwiches are absolutely incredible and everyone needs to try one at least once in their lives. Don't expect anything too healthy, though!
My perfect day in the mission is eating Ike's sandwiches while lounging at Mission Dolores and then grabbing bi-rite for dessert. Ike's sandwiches are all super creative and unique. If you are looking for a basic sandwich, this isn't for you. However, you are looking for a sandwich that will wow your taste buds with saucy amazingness then you should definitely check this place out!When I come, I normally get the Mnage  trois, Name of the girl I am dating, or we're just friends (I really like the chicken.) However, I have tried a bunch of the other sandwiches including the super Mario brothers and the count of monte chase-o. Everything I have tried has been amazing. The sandwiches are massive and I can never finish a whole one in a sitting. It's almost as big as my face!! I think the sauciness pairs nicely with Dutch crunch bread. The ingredients always seem fresh and the sandwiches prepared with love. I also like how the sandwich normally comes with a bag of chips and a lollipop!There isn't much place to sit at this location and the parking can be difficult. The lines are long and the sandwiches more on the expensive side. However, since the sandwiches are amazing, everyone should try this place at least once! If you hate the lines, you can always order online or call in your order to avoid the wait!
Finally got to try Ike's Place today. I ordered the Elvis Keith and my GF got Will the Thrill. I have to say their dutch crunch bread is pretty good, but the sandwich itself was only OK. The Elvis Keith is a little too sweet for me. I did not like the teriyaki sauce for the chicken, it just didn't taste very good. This sandwich is only at best 3 stars. However, Will the Thrill was really good. The spicy sausage they use in this sandwich was perfect. It's a 5 star sandwich. The portions are good, the sandwiches will definitely fill you up and I also think the price is pretty reasonable. We would come back again!
A little pricey (around $13/sandwich) but it was the best sandwich I've ever had in my entire life. We were told it was HH @ around 4:30 so we got a free drink & bag of chips per sandwich.
Why have I not been to ikes for the past six years of existence is beyond me. It lives up to the 6500+ reviews of 4-5 stars! Pro tips:-Order ahead of time. Call in an hour before and it will promptly be ready for pick up in the expected time. -Order the MATT CAIN!!!!!-Take your order and walk two blocks up to Dolores Park and call it an afternoon.Drawbacks:-wait time, but who cares! You're getting a hand crafted sandwich that can never be underestimated. I've been to Ikes once and by all means it won't be the last! Out of towners and tourists of the beautiful city of San Francisco, you MUST add this to your FOODIE LIST. You will not be disappointed!
Yep! It was as good as advertised!We got two sandwiches to go. Paul Reubens -French Dressing, HomeMade Poppy Seed Coleslaw, Pastrami, SwissLincecum -Avocado, Bacon, Ham, Havarti, Turkey Beautifully assembled sandwiches on freshly baked bread, artfully cut in half diagonally for easier consumption, served with a bag of chips and a Charm Pop.The line was a bit long at lunchtime on a Sunday afternoon but the staff was efficient and friendly. Definitely worth the wait!
If you Love sandwiches like I do, then you'll love Ikes! Best thing I've stumbled upon in the city!
AMAZING.I'm sad that I haven't gotten around to eating at Ike's sooner because their sandwiches are to die for. I arrived around 11 AM on a weekday in order to beat the crowd and I was the first one there... nobody around! The guy at the register was really nice and gave me time to read the menu since it was so large. I ordered the Paul Reubens: French Dressing, HomeMade Poppy Seed Coleslaw, Pastrami, and Swiss cheese. Each sandwich comes with a choice of chips, and they have a nicely arranged display of all their chips so you can easily choose. Service was fast, I only waited about 5 minutes and my sandwich was up! By the way, this place only has a few chairs lined up against the wall but no tables, so it's more of an order and go kind of place.Okay so the sandwich. It was MASSIVE. It's definitely worth the $10 because they give you a ton of meat and they pile on the veggies. I can usually eat quite a bit but I could only finish half of this sandwich, probably because I scarfed the entire bag of salt and vinegar chips. The pastrami, french dressing, veggie combo tasted great, and I'm glad the guy at the register asked me if I liked pickles because he added those on too! Oh and the coleslaw gave the sandwich an amazing crunch and creamy factor. YESSSSS. I would definitely definitely definitely come back here. The menu is so huge that you can come every day and have something different. Thanks so much Ike you're doing a great job! =D
We made the mistake of coming here on a Saturday afternoon. We waited in line about 40 minutes and the line was just outside the door. There was a lot of online orders placed in between ours so that slowed down the kitchen. My sandwich was alright but the guys I was with had great sandwiches. Mine had turkey, ham, melted brie and I added strawberry jam. It was good, but not worth the wait. My husband had the chicken Caesar one and it was great... that was worth the wait. My brother had a steak like one of some sort and loved it. It was his second time here and he was impressed each time. I would absolutely eat here again.
the dutch crunch french bread is perfect to go with any sandwich of your choice.My sandwich Demon bruce was unbelievably good and worth the price of $13..Half of the sandwich filled me up! it doesn't come with a drink, or chips but they do offer a free lollipop. Prepare to wait for at least 15-30 mins for your sandwich to be made.
People can say it's pricey all they want, but the sandwich is HUGE. And it's not your average Subway sandwich filled with low quality meats; they use Premium meats! Did I mention the sandwich is HUGE!? You can EASILY split a sandwich between two people, but if you're like me, you ain't sharin'! On top of a huge sandwich with great meat, you get a bag of their chips that I'm assuming are made just for Ike's.Matt CainI'm a Dodger fan, but when I go to Ike's, I'm a Matt Cain fan. This sandwich comes with their sauce called "Godfather sauce". Just the name alone, you know the sauce is Uh-MAZE-ing. BTW, it comes with Roast Beef, Turkey, and Salami. I'm craving another one just writing this review.There are a million reviews on Ike's already. All the reviews are all raving on how great this place is (which is it!). I can honestly say this is the BEST sandwich I've EVER had. 5 stars without a doubt.Now, I just have to plan my next trip back to SF..
Tried the hot mama huda, Matt Cain, and Hollywood cheesesteak. All were great sandwiches and the Dutch crunch bread is a must. Took about an hour to wait in line and get it to go which makes this 4 stars instead of 5.
Weird!! Everyone wearing hair nets. Then the guy with the larges bushiest beard I've ever seen isn't required to wear a net around that thing? I work in the food industry. This is a no no. Your lucky the food is amazing. Their may be an occasional hair in there though
I got the Yale University and it was truly the best sandwich I have ever had in my entire life!
Maybe I need to try something else. I got a sandwich and it was less than amazing. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing?
Finally decided to brave the lines at Ike's for a try...next time, I'm definitely calling in. Literally, it took an hour of waiting before getting my sandwiches in hand. I can't believe I waited a whole hour....for sandwiches!! But was it worth it? YES.The Menage a Trois definitely lived up to it's hype. I loved the fact that the halal chicken was more shredded than patty like (definitely makes me more confident that it actually was chicken) but on the flip side, I didn't really dig the shredded lettuce. The sauce is amazing though. Honey and BBQ is like PB&J or tomato soup and grilled cheese - it's every kind of right. And the dutch crunch definitely does a great job of holding the entire concoction together. I can't wait to try more of Ike's 900+ offerings!
Their sandwiches are awesome because of their special sauce! I don't really think you can go wrong with an order here (I have tried their Lincecum and Matt Cain, and both were awesome), just make sure you get Dutch Crunch bread. Do keep in mind though that their sandwiches can get quite messy because of the special sauce, so I wouldn't order their sandwiches if you need to keep clean during the meal (e.g. if you are wearing nice clothes or if you have to eat in front of a bunch of people during a working meeting in an office).The line can get crazy here during the week so be smart and phone in your order around 11 AM or earlier! If you phone in your order you can skip the long line for those who are ordering there (to the right side of the store) and just wait in the much shorter pick-up line (to the left side of the store). Their store is located a few blocks away from the Church Street MUNI station.
Tasty sandwiches but nothing out of the ordinary. Super long line.
Best Sub of my Life! Anytime in San Francisco I try to fit in a stop at Ike's. I get the 3-Way. It's literally a party in my mouth.I would eat this every day for the rest of my life if I could.
I love Ike's. I order from this place regularly. I'm updating my previous five star review to knock it down one star. Today the bread did not taste fresh, and the chicken in the sandwich was so dry it tasted like canned tuna.
Finally tried the famous Ike's.Here are your instructions:Step 1: Choose your sammie by checking out the extensive menu online. There's a zillion sandwiches with weird names...like Stupid Eggplant Sandwich.Step 2: Call in your order before leaving your house. It was a Saturday around lunch and the estimated time for the food to be made was about and 1 hour and 15 mins after order placement.Step 3: Go to Ike's and skip that ridiculous line. (*Note: stay along the side of the building and don't try waiting on that stoop next door...I know this from experience and the line monitor, yes there's even a line monitor, will kindly ask you to move.)Step 4: Proceed to Dolores Park for chowing down and some good people watching. Step 5: Eat your finger lickin' good sammie. I got the Spiffy Tiffy: halal shredded chicken, pesto, avocado, cheese, and shrooms. They were out of shrooms so they added bacon for no extra charge. Minus one star because they got the order wrong on my friend's sandwich, ended up with an entirely different sandwich but the place is pretty good at making sammies so he still enjoyed it. But they did give us some caramel apple lollies for dessert. Perfect afternoon in my book.
I can see why the lines is constantly out the door! This place has really realyl good sandwiches! Not the ham cheese boring sandwich that you pack for lunch back in elementary school, but these are loaded! The dutch crunch is always a favorite for the bread. Plenty of vegetarian and vegan options as well!I got the Menage a Trois- BBQ, Cheddar, Halal Chicken, Honey Mustard, Pepper Jack, Real Honey, Swiss. They said it was the most popular one there, so I decided to get this on the Dutch Crunch.The halal chicken was shredded in sauce and it was sooo good! I didnt even have to chew through the chicken because it was so soft. I loved the cheese. It's the perfect and most filling sandwich. Also you get a selection of chips as well! I got the voodoo chips! So good! Wish there was tables in here so I can eat my sandwich instead of going elsewhere!
Stopped by here for grabbing lunch on our way to twin peaks, we arrived around 1:00 pm, waited about 20 minutes to place order, and then got our sandwich after another 20 mins. We ordered the "Robin Williams", which was made with chicken, mushroom, mustard and some "secret dirty sauce" they are proud of...I didn't see anything special, but yeah, the sandwich tasted good anyway...
THE BEST SANDWHICH I HAVE EVER HAD! I am from SoCal and was recommended this place and it was amazing! They have over 400 sandwiches but I was only able to try 2! Friendly staff, amazing beverages, and delicious different types of chips to go with your sandwhichss
Listen, this place is Legit with a capital L. When I sank my teeth into what Ike's gave me, I realized this was probably the best sandwich I have had on American soil. I figure if you're in San Francisco, and want to try one of the local icons, go here for lunch. Natives San Franciscans all know this place, and when you tell them about it will say "oh yeah, Ike's! I love that place!" Background: I was in San Fran on a business trip, and figured I would go to the most reviewed SF restaurant on Yelp: Ike's. I drove down, found parking on the street adjacent to 16th St without any problems, and popped in to find out what all the fuss was about. Now I'm part of the fuss.Atmosphere: A lot of people have written about the lines, but when I walked in I encountered virtually no line. I went in around 4 or 5, so if you want to avoid the lines, perhaps come in during odd hours. As others have described, the feel is San Fran hipster: black-rim glasses hipsters working the counter, who are friendly and know the menu. The floor is concrete and the place is a little grimy and dirty, but not too bad. The bathroom is clean. There is limited seating in the corner - a bench and a few chairs, but not a lot. A good place to strike up a conversation with some random peeps, like I did. Tourists and locals alike love this place. Food: the sandwiches are customizable and amazing. You choose the bread. What I always do - and what I suggest others do - is always walk in and ask what are the most popular items on the menu. The dude at the front obliged, and listed one sandwich that had salami and a host of other meats, and another sandwich that involved chicken and honey mustard. I went for the latter, and it was pretty bomb. I also asked him which brand of chips was most popular - and he said the voodoo chips (crunchy chips with a cajun style seasoning) - so I went for those. All in all, an awesome meal. Price: Cheap. Somewhere around $13 all-in, including the sammich, the voodoo chips and the drink. Ike's is also in a nice, walkable area, so you can take off from there and walk around town.
VERDICT: Call your food order to avoid the long wait while non-locals take up the regular purchase light on the right side. Pick-up orders go to the front, but it still took a long time to bag our bulk order sandwiches.QUALIFIER: Just a short walk from the Metro. There is very little seating area inside, but not really enough for sit-down eating.FOOD: Fresh, warm sandwiches made just the way you like them. There's a whole variety to choose from. Look through the menu for your favorite items. And then after that, try the other locations they have, where the menu differs by location.SERVICE: Though they seemed to hustle, they were quite slow at processing the orders.
That dutch crunch bread is SO EN POINTE. The Manage a Trois is a perfect partner to the bad boy. A bite of the crunchy bread with their awesome sauce, moist shredded chicken, tomato, and lettuce is too perfect for words.
I've been to Ike's a couple of times and I was never a huge fan until I tried the Jessica Rabbit sandwich this past visit. It was not on their menu in the store but they serve all the different sandwiches on their website, so I recommend looking up their menu online before going on so you can decide from their vast variety of options what you want! Another tip, ORDER AHEAD! Especially if you're going during peak lunch time in the week or the weekend, the line is pretty long and does take a considerable amount of time if you wait. Anyways, back to the sandwich, it was so different yet so delicious! Vegan breaded chicken, buffalo sauce, ranch, lettuce and on top of everything, JALAPENO POPPERS! IT was probably very unhealthy, but who cares when you're eating such a great sandwich? Highly recommend it to anyone looking to try something new and adventurous! Also get their chips! I think during the weekdays, they give chips with the sandwich, but not on the weekend. It's a perfect small snack which you're waiting for them to make your sandwich. The hype for this place is not that overrated if you find the right sandwich for you (just might take a little while to find that perfect one).
A-mazing!! The sandwiches here are so tasty & full of flavor. My husband & I got the Nacho Boy sandwich & split it as the portions are huge! It was excellent & we got free potato chips & a free can of soda, so cannot complain! We were served by Alex "nachoboy" & he was so nice and friendly & very knowledgeable of the menu & able to offer info & advice. My only negative is that you can't sit and each your sandwich in Ike's place, it's a takeaway kind of place, so you have to check out the area for somewhere suitable to eat & its a big sandwich so you need some room!
Having live in San Francisco for yearsssss, I finally had the opportunity to try out the legendary Ike's. Well, in short, this is way way over-rated. The sandwiches are great but definitely not worth to stand in lines for hours . I wouldn't consider their sandwiches a must have or to die for. Their bread is some brand bread and so are their meat. It's not like they're homemade. I don't understand how people mentioned their sandwiches are fresh. What fresh? They brought their stuff and made it into a sandwiches, it's not like they bake their bread in the morning or cured their meats themselves to perfection. Their sandwiches prices are in the high side. Expect to spend $15-20 for a meal(with a chips & a drink). I guess only those bankers who work in Financial District can afford that for their daily lunch.I rated it as a 4-Star because it is a decent sandwiches but will not stand in line for an hour just for their sandwiches. Or write home about how great their sandwiches are. If I'm happen to be around the area and with no or very short line, I will get in. I will not go drive like 15 mins specially for their sandwiches.
The Dutch Crunch bread is something worth writing home about! Between that and the liberal amounts of avocado on many of their sammies, you can't go wrong. Worth the wait. Cash only.
They have gluten free bread here! praise everything woot woot!Sf native, first time trying the famous ike's. Well it was pretty damn delicious and definitely did not disappoint.My friend and I weren't too hungry so we shared the Say Hey (pastrami, swiss, bacon, and dirty sauce).Very big heaping of meat. Solid flavor combo. Solid sandwich.I'll have to say, i'm not the biggest sandwich girl and I was quite satisfied by how well they wrapped up the sandwich and had the perfect combination of veggies to meat ratio.Good job ike's!BTW call in and order to avoid the long line!
The "Going Home for Thanksgiving" sandwich was killer. It really hit the spot and the ingredients were all great tasting on their own. I especially enjoyed the Ike's famous crunch bread (I don't remember the full title of it). To make the sandwich even better, they carried the Voodoo chips and it made the meal absolutely perfect. The only thing that would make this place better would be some tables and more places to sit.
Get the menage a trois! I called in an order since we were spending the day at Dolores Park nearby and they told me it would be ready in an 1 hour. An hour wait!?!? Good thing I called ahead. Anyways, I picked up my order an hour later and my sandwich came with the a free bag of chips. The Menage a Trois comes with halal chicken, honey, honey mustard, bbq sauce, pepper jack, swiss, and cheddar. As you can see, the sandwich comes with a lot of sauce and can get really messy. Be sure to have napkins nearby when eating!
Yummy sandwich. Better have been after waiting for 45 minutes.
I'm extremely disappointed..This is the third time Ike's has let me down, and I'm over it. I mean, if you're gonna charge me $13 for a sandwich, can it at least be slightly warm?!! I called at 11AM to pick up and they quoted me 25 minutes (for one of the least elaborate sandwiches, mind you) which I thought was too long. When the cashier picked up on that he offered to have me pick it up at a later time. To most this would imply that they'd make the sandwich close to the time of pick up.. Sadly, not to the employees at Ike's. And so here I sit, with a cold ass $13 sandwich. UghNever going back.
I promise you, I've never had a sandwich like this. I had Mike Cain with added pesto and with the first bite I entered that spiritual realm, where you realize, that nirvana is there, somewhere around the corner.Seriously though, if you're ever around, take a pilgrimage to this place, look up onto that menu board, and say a prayer out-loud, and the guy behind the counter will make it come true. Not the fastest service, but I guess it takes time for that cook to do the magic over that sandwich..
5 star food, 5 star customer service, 2 stars for logistics/crowd streamlining.So I've been before (infrequently due to the crowds), but today I stopped by (Saturday afternoon) and timed my visit out of boredom. From the moment I got in line to the moment I was handed my food, 52 minutes passed. With the free WiFi, it really didn't feel that long, but let's be real - it's unreasonable to wait an hour for a sandwich. I get that part of it is due to hype and popularity, but part of it is also due to poor management of crowds. First off, it isn't made clear to new visitors that they no longer accept credit cards (as of March 2015.) There's a tiny printed paper explaining this on the wall, but I suspect the cashiers have to repeatedly explain to people how to use the Kash app, etc. For most of the time I was there, there was also only one person taking orders. If they clarified payment procedures well in advance of the register and had more people taking orders, the line might not move at such a snail's pace. (Although, who knows, maybe then they would still be equally slow from a kitchen backlog...)That said, the person taking orders was incredibly friendly and helpful. And the sandwiches were delicious and huge, as has always been the case here in my experience. Also, Ike came in for a bit! Very exciting. He helped out with the pickup line for a little bit and then made himself a sandwich before leaving. (Ok, I haven't seen him in real life before so this was a highlight.)
Very famous sandwich spot so it's a must to try it while in the Bay. I really enjoyed my sandwich (cant remember what it was called but it was a vegetarian option). My only draw back is that its pretty heavy. I felt as if I had to eat the whole thing because it was so good but after feeling sick from how heavy it was I didnt want to eat it again.A short while later, Im ready to go back! Its defn worth a visit
The 7 layer cake brownie is heaven in your mouth. I ordered 3 sandwiches and my favorite was the spiffy tiffy. So yummy! I also loved the mnage tois!
I've been eating deli sandwiches my whole life, and I've spent 4 of those years working in a deli. I have never had a Ruben as good as the one here at Ike's. Hell, I've never even made a Ruben like this, and I was known in my deli for making the best Ruben around. So my hat is off to Ike's, best Ruben in the country as far as I know.
On a Sunday, even if you are able to get in line at the door of the place (as in, you're not way back by Kitchen Story) at noon, you will have to wait 1.5-2 hrs to get to the counter to order, and another 0.5-1 hr to get your sandwich. I kid you not, I exaggerate not. Why did my friend and I wait so long? We really didn't expect the line to take that long and just didn't know when to quit. Our innocent, hapless hope that the wait wouldn't be too bad, just another 5 minutes, oh look we're almost at the counter... was naive. Ike's sandwiches are lovely but the wait is much, much longer than what even the most seasoned SF long-line-waiting veteran can anticipate. I highly recommend you order ahead (online, or on their app if that's still around) and bring a book when you go to pick up your sandwich (there was a long line in the pick-up line--don't know if that means they were ALL order-ahead people, or if many of them were had-just-ordered-at-the-counter people. Just be prepared in case you do have to wait, despite ordering ahead and being told what time the sandwich is ready.)I'd like to note that Ike's is not necessarily to blame for the long wait. They have very few people making an inordinately large amount of sandwiches at a breakneck pace. They also are going back and forth between postmates people, wait-in-line people, and order-ahead people. Then again, I think that is where Ike's could improve. I would definitely recommend to the establishment to just cut out wait-in-line ability altogether -- if everyone was forced to call in to order, or use the app to order, then I think efficiency on all fronts will be increased, and also satisfaction. You won't have a bunch of hungry, sad and unhappy people waiting for 2+ hours because they didn't know it would take that long to get a sandwich. The Ikesters will be under less duress and stress. The store itself doesn't have any seating/tables (other than waiting benches) anyway. Please just force everyone to order ahead, and then when I find out my sandwich will take 4 hours, at least I know that it will take 4 hours.Other comments: I do love their sandwiches. I'm sad the potato chips are no longer free. I'm happy the caramel apple lollipops are still free. Dutch Crunch bread all the way. Matt Cain is yummy.
Great little sandwhich shop. There isn't any real seating but that adds to their charm. I had the Backstabber which is a Turkey, Swiss & Artichoke Hearts sandwhich - DELICIOUS! I also love the soda pop (CCCP!)
I'm sure this place would have been a hands down 5 stars had I not ordered my Lex Luter through Postmates (onion rings not crispy...bread not super warm....the works, but understandable since I decided to be lazy and order through postmates) Anyways.... the sandwich was just like everything you would expect. Freaking onion rings, cheese, fried chicken...and alllll those other crazy toppings wrapped together with the perfect sauce....#Bomb #FresherWouldveBeenBetterNext time I feel like consuming a heart attack between some nice Dutch Crunch bread...I will most definitely go to the shop! I think it will make the WORLD of a difference. Overall YES. Come here and get ready to read through each and every item on the menu since the sandwich names are non-intuitively/absolutely bare little/no relationship to the contents inside the sandwich.
Got the kryptonite following the man vs food craze. being an international customer we would have love to take pictures of the sandwich being made and was promised this by the cashier but dissapointed that this promise was not followed through. overall the sandwich was amazing but very very overpriced
There's been an Ike's opened in Westwood, Ca for at least the last year but I had to come to SF to try the original. This place was packed on a Sunday afternoon so that's indicative of how good their sandwiches are. I had the spiffy tiffy (chicken, pesto, mushrooms, sprouts) and the Paul Reuben (classic Reuben ingredients) which were both so delicious! The sandwiches are moist and they do not skimp on any ingredients. Be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes when it's busy but it's so worth it! The owner Ike was even there passing out orders which made the experience that much more special. I can't wait to try the one in LA.
Mnage trios ever time is my go to when I'm in town. Tip: call in your order, unless you want to wait in the line.
Oh, the things I would do for another "Matt Cain" sandwich right now! It's a meat lover's dream--salami, roast beef, and turkey, with provolone and some dressing. Absolutely delicious. They're "dutch crunch" bread might be the best I've ever had on a sandwich. I also couldn't say no to adding mozzarella sticks, which might have been the best decision of my life. I never would have thought to add mozzarella sticks to a sandwich before, which is really unfortunate because it works really well!Ike's is a carryout place with just a few benches inside so we took our sandwiches over to Dolores Park (only a few blocks away) and ate them over a gorgeous view of the city. I'd love to come back and try the rest of their menu but it'll be hard to resist another Matt Cain (if it aint broke, don't fix it).One complaint: the amount of dressing was a little ridiculous...almost to the point of overpowering everything else. I can't really fault Ike's for this, though--it's really just a personal preference thing. Next time I go, I'll just ask them to go a little lighter on the dressing, or something like that. For the sake of my health, I'm glad I don't live in San Francisco..I'd be coming here all the time!s
Sandwich done right! So they have quite an extensive menu on yelp that was a bit overwhelming, but if you look on their board, they list out the most popular ones. They also have several choices of bread and I opted for the dutch crunch for my Matt Cain. I was a little skeptical cus usually crusty breads aren't my thangg but omggg that bread was perfection. And the godfather sauce...I wish theyd sell that in bottles. The size of the sandwich was perfect for sharing too. 1 star off for the superrr long wait to get our food, it was at least 30 min.
Best sandwich I have ever tasted. Had the Spiffy Tiffy sandwich which has chicken mixed in pesto, provolone cheese, avocado, and sauteed mushrooms.  The bread was delicious. Crunchy and fresh. There was also some kind of sauce in the sandwich. Really good. Must go to place.
The food is pretty good. Expensive for the experience. They need more efficiency and better service. Orders are mixed up every time I come here.
Best vegan sandwich of all time! Wish I could have tried them all but the pilgrim was amazing!
I know people always wanna add hella dumbass shit to their sandwiches so it SOUNDS good on paper but FOREAL FOREAL...."home for thanksgiving" (turkey, cranberry sauce, havarti, sriracha)but, add cream cheese. and oh my lord. good god.that's it. that's the end game. the period. BYE.
3 stars for A-ok. I went on a Thursday at 11:30am and it took about 15 minutes to get my sandwich. I'll drive by on a Saturday or Sunday and the line is out the door and around the block, so I was excited to be able to dip in a try it out without a lot of hassle. I had never been before (heard and have seen the wait can be over an hour), and so when I walked up I asked for "whatever people order the most," and I was told to order the Matt Cain, a Turkey Roast Beef on Dutch Crunch. So be it.I don't get it, I don't understand at all why people would wait 1 hour for this sandwich, and I'm sure I need to order one or two more to have a firm opinion. It was perfectly good, a nice tasty sandwich, good size. You can get an identical sandwich at Subs Inc in Noe (Godfather), and you can get even better sandwiches at Pops Sandwich Shop in Twin Peaks (Get the Tommy Salami) or The Submarine Center in West Portal (Hot pastrami - this one being pretty amazing actually), and it takes maybe 3 minutes in line and 5 minutes waiting. I suppose it's just a density of neighborhood - Castro / Mission is crowded, and it's a good sandwich shop, and people can't get to West Portal, or just don't want to. Feels a little echo-chamberish, crowds beget crowds. Anyway, perfectly nice sandwich and crew, but I was a little disappointed by not being blown away. I'd have been bummed if I waited an hour for this.
I had the Elvis Kieth - Halal chicken breast, teriyaki sauce, wasabi mayo, and swiss cheese. Also added lettuce, tomato, and banana peppers. It was really flavorful (especially the wasabi mayo) and very filling (even though I only ate half and saved the rest for later). The sandwich is jam-packed with ingredients (lots of meat) and probably the best sub I've had, but I guess I'm not huge into sandwiches usually. The sandwiches average around $10 each and for enough food for 2 meals, that's quite good. Plus there are MANY tasty-looking options, enough to keep subsequent visits interesting.The one thing I will say is that it's VERY crowded and the line doesn't move fast at all. On a Sunday at lunchtime, it took my crew around 1 hour to get our sandwiches. Obviously no seating inside (other than a waiting area), so we took them out to nearby Dolores Park to eat.
The smell of cauterized human flesh may have ruined smoked meat for me for the rest of my life. However, people were lined up for Ike's, so perhaps it's still palatable for most people. One of their halal chicken sandwiches was ok. Again, the smoked meat reminded me of things I'm not keen on eating. This nullifies any concern about Donner like behavior. (Why is Yelp not putting periods after my sentences?) -2 stars for the kitchen room where employees seemed to be in an assembly line not changing gloves between sandwiches. This could pose a hazard for those with religious or medical dietary restrictions. Ergo, my three star review. Thanks for reading.
Just paid 15$ for a sandwhich I physically could not eat because of how messy and saucy it was. Indeed I order BBQ sauce and ranch on it but that doesn't mean you drench the thing so much the bread is soggy literally 2 min after its made and I try to eat it. I've been eating at Ike's for a little over four years now and I can definitely say it was much better then than now. Sometimes little gems should not be spread all over many locations and left small and hidden. That's what used to make this place great quality and all around service.
What a Bummer! Ike's used to be one of my favorites but our latest visit was such a disappointment i decided to write a review. I ordered by phone (but had to repeat myself three times bc the woman kept getting my order wrong. Plus she asked if we wanted lettuce and tomato each time. We want what is listed on the description. Why ask?).When we arrived the order line was empty but the pick-up area was a mess. Names were being called but there was no differentiation between those of us whose orders we ready versus those who weren't. There were two open registers but only one person checking pick-ups out. (She was pushing the new Kash app pretty hard.) Chips are no longer included, so after adding drinks and chips, our order was $30 (excluding tip).The worst part, though, was that the sandwiches were squashed, missing ingredients, and had a condiment smeared on the paper that didn't belong on my mine (cranberry sauce). So not worth the money, wait or effort to pick them up!Ike's... you may have lost us for good. :(
My family of four got four different sandwiches and they were the best sandwiches we have ever had! Their garlic aioli sauce was so tasty! The man behind the counter wearing a cape was awesome and very patient with us first timers. Bathroom was nasty though!
The king of all sandwich places in my opinion. They have a massive selection of different sandwiches for everyone's taste. Options from a hardcore carnivore to a vegetarian, they have it all.Spiffy Tiffy is my sandwich of choice. Halal chicken, pesto, tomatoes and lettuce.
First time going and it lived up to the hype. I got the "Were Just Friends' sandwich in honor of my innate ability to get friend-zoned.If you can resist eating your sandwich for ten minutes, walk up to Corona Heights Park and take in the amazing view as you smash your food.
We were first in line this morning, on a Sunday, and turns out this was a good thing because we were told it gets so crowded there's often and hour plus wait.We had the Matt Cain, which was delicious, we liked this one best.  But very skimpy on the meat. Not worth the price!We also ordered the menage a trois - halal chicken (which was shredded), bbq sauce, honey. It was a good too, more of a sweet flavor profile, like honey BBQ chicken. It reminded some of us of a Quizno sandwich.We came here after walking a few miles thru Mount Sutro forest. And up to the Corona Heights Park for incredible views. Easy to walk down to 16th and stop here for a sandwich. Took the muni on Church home.
Ike's...Oh Ike's.. how I love you! I'm from Seattle and we're all about Paseo, the Caribbean sandwich but I'd have to say, Ike's is almost just as good! It really lives up to the hype of having the best sandwiches in SF. I got the Menage a trois and also the Name of the Girl I'm Dating on Dutch and my goodness! So delicious!!! Love the zesty jam-ish sauce along with the chicken and huge smack of avocado.I'm drooling just thinking about it. I can't wait to come back here.
Cash only, and a long wait, but totally lives up to the hype. I ordered a Sometimes I'm a Vegan, and was delighted by the ginormous size of the sandwich, and the incredible secret sauce within. Looking forward to trying more, and would definitely be all over the menu if I was a meat-eater. Mmmmm.
I always get the Spiffy Tiffy.. I know I should try something else, but it's just so good!! I would recommend not going during lunch time.. This place can get busy and it might take a while to get your sandwiches.. I recommend to call ahead if you can!
Know what you want? Call in your order. Have no effin' clue because everything sounds amazing and you can't make a decision and the fact that they have a secret menu that pretty much doubles your options doesn't help with your indecisiveness? Join the crowd waiting in line :)Ike's makes solid sandwiches jam-packed with flavor. The Dirty Secret Sauce that "is spread on every sandwich and baked right in the bread, and another layer is spread on afterwards to give it that extra flavor," guarantees that their sandwiches cannot be replicated at home (unless you steal a jar of their secret sauce, I 'spose). It's the novelty of the combinations that makes Ike's sandwiches such a treat.Back in the summer of '12, I had the opportunity to split a $19.91 KRYPTONITE (yelp.com/biz_photos/ikes) with a friend of mine. What the eff is in this hulking sandwich? Everything...AND MORE. Avocado, bacon, beer-battered onion rings, corned beef, EXTRA pepper jack, ham, mozzarella sticks, pastrami, pesto, roast beef, salami, stuffed jalapeo poppers, turkey. Though all sandwiches come with lettuce and tomatoes, I'm pretty sure that they scrapped that healthy shizz to fit in all of this artery-clogging goodness. I couldn't even finish my half of the sandwich because it's essentially two whole sandwiches in one.More recently, my roommate and I split the $11.11 MENAGE A TROIS. Since my standard was the hulking Kryptonite, I thought the sandwich was kind of small haha. We opted for Dutch crunch bread (among options of French, SF sourdough, and whole wheat), which surrounded the fillings of BBQ sauce, cheddar, halal chicken, honey mustard, pepper jack, real honey, and swiss (yelp.com/biz_photos/ikes). Free add-ons of onions, pickles, banana peppers, jalapeos, and mustards. Loved how tender the chicken was, and who wouldn't salivate over all that cheese? The sauce was good but, surprisingly, I didn't think it was necessary.With that order, we got a free bag of chips. I HIGHLY recommend the New Orleans flavored kettle chips. It pairs amazingly well with the Menage a Trois sandwich, aka make it a Menage a Quatre by sticking the chips in your sammich. Trust me on this. Make it a foursome.The unhealthiest sandwich you'll ever eat. And you'll crave more the moment you're done.
The original Ike's place! This place is probably the only sandwich place I will ever go to. Their menu is extensive and offers a wide range of tastes and flavors.First timers either order a sandwich off the menu or create your own. Favorites include the Mnage A Trois on Dutch crunch!Their prices are a little expensive but you get good sized portions that will seriously fill you up! Expect a good 15-20 wait and lines inside.They don't accept credit cards which is a setback hence the four star rating.Helpful Tip: since they don't offer any type of seating, walk to Dolores Park two blocks away and enjoy your lunch with a view of the city!
Generally not a fan of sandwiches...but this is an exception! They have 200 sandwiches and I got the Mnage a Trois and it was amazing. They have an in-house sauce they put on all their breads, the dirty sauce, and it's delicious. I love their huckleberry soda! Highly recommend this place! I recommend eating it by the Dolores Park with an incredible view. The staff was friendly too.
Soggy terrible sandwhich. They are good at marketing and terrible at food. Hopefully you don't make the same mistake.
Get the Kryptonite. Yes, it's huge and probably is over 4000 calories for a whole sandwich but if you go to Ike's and not get the Kryptonite, you'll be missing out on the whole experience. The Kryptonite has ham, salami, turkey, roast beef, corned beef, cheese, fried mozzarella sticks, jalapeno poppers, onion rings, pesto, avocado, and some veggies. The whole sandwich is $20. I split it with a friend and ate my half for the next 3 meals.There is a long line at Ike's so go early. You can't really eat your sandwiches there since there's no space but a good option is to walk 2 blocks over to Dolores Park and enjoy your sandwich there.They have a lot of different sandwich options to choose from. One of my friends had the Lex Luther and that was really good. It's really meaty and heavy though. I enjoyed my Kryptonite a lot more. It's huge but not overwhelming. Everything balanced out well and the pesto and avocado really helped give a lot of flavor.Your sandwich comes with a bag of chips even though you won't have any room for it in your stomach. I recommend the red hot kettle chips they have. It's in a white and red bag.
This place definitely worth the hype. We came here for our last meal before the flight - which was lunch time. Thankfully we stayed 10 minutes walk, so we were able to just walk there with our suitcases. I got Spiffy Tiffy - even though it wasn't listed on the board menu, I pointed out the picture from yelp. It was amazing! So fresh and delicious, one of the best sandwiches I ever tried! :)) The service is very nice as well. People were extremely nice and friendly.
I can't believe it's taken me this long to finally try Ike's. Hands down this is one of the yummiest place to get a sandwich! Prior to my visit, I had looked at their menu online. However, when I got to Ike's, I was overwhelmed with their menu board (even though not all their sandwiches are listed since they offer 300+ sandwiches). Being an "Ike's Virgin", I asked the cashier for a recommendation. He suggested the 49er and Hot Momma Huda after I told him I wanted something spicy and with chicken. I decided to go with the 49er. 49er ($11.91) - halal chicken+cheddar+lettuce+tomato+honey mustard+buffalo wing sauce on a dutch crunch. DELICIOUS and HEAVENLY!!!! The sandwich was the perfect combination of sweet and spicy with a good blend of flavor. I added pickles and jalapenos which gave it an extra crunch and kick. Menage A Trois ($11.11) - bbq sauce+cheddar+halal chicken+honey mustard+pepper jack+real honey+swiss on a dutch crunch. It's packed with good flavors, but the sweetness from the bbq and honey was overkill for me. Say Hey ($8.98) - pastrami+bacon+swiss - My mom said it was very tasty and loved it. She liked that Ike's was generous with the meat. The sandwiches are a bit pricey, but it's definitely worth the hype!
The portion is so filling! If you don't eat much, I suggest splitting the sandwich with your friend so you two can just pay around $5 each for a giant half-sandwich.It's hard to find seats there, there's not much seats. I think about 15 lucky people will be able to find a seat, and I'm also including outside. There's a tree ledge outside.
The wait is painfully slow. By the time I got my one sandwich after an hour+, my Dutch crunch bun was soggy. What happened Ike?!
Very friendly staff. Tried the mnage. Chicken was tender , flavor was outstanding, Dutch bread was crispy. Very cool place. Sad that I will not get to try anything else on the menu.
This place is an absolute delight! Great filling unique sub sandwiches like no other! Fantastic vegetarian options. Highly recommend the mnage and follow me lesbian something. Crazy names and I've heard they have a secret menu!! Waiting for a place like this to open in LA. But be warned there is no dinning in seating, nonetheless you'll enjoy it! Ps. Pay with cash and get a free drink!!
Preface, this review is from a vegan eater, and reflects the vegan portion of Ike's menu.I ordered a Vegan Tom Brady, which is a soy chicken, avocado, mushroom and vegan cheese sandwich. What I received was a goopy soggy bread mess with gross goopy vegan cheese dribbling out. Granted, vegan cheese is really hard to get right. Their vegan cheese was really runny and sour and pretty gross. I managed to get most of the sandwich down, but my stomach felt really funky afterwards. I had to get a second dinner to settle my stomach (indochine on Valencia is open til 10 :)). I was surprised I didn't vomit later in the night.I wouldn't come here in my own again, and if I were forced to, I'd definitely ask for a sandwich without any cheese.
I ordered a Barry Bonds (756) which they said was Turkey, Swiss, Bacon, Avocado (and Lettuce/Tomato if wanted). I asked if there was anything else on it and they said no and when My sandwich had a good deal of mayo (or aioli) on it which was not specified and I don't like either. Also they forgot my avocado, so my sandwich was just Turkey, Swiss, and Bacon...Even though the staff was friendly and they have a 'happy hour' deal where you get free chips and a water, I was disappointed with my sandwich.
When I'm not at one of our corporate offices, and I'm working from home, it's at least easier if you mess up my sandwich then, so at least I could drive back.The other day, however, I had to drive from near Mountain View all the way to San Francisco (which was my choice) to grab a sandwich. A sandwich, that, when I brought it back to my office, was missing some ingredients!I ordered a 660. Pastrami with avocado on Dutch crunch. It was missing the avocado, and the red onions I asked for. But, I love your magical sandwich spread, and your sandwich. Hence the 3 instead of 4 stars.Just don't mess it up next time, okay?
Fast, Friendly, and most importantly delicious. We got a sandwich and took it to the top of SF. The view and the sandwich was a perfect start to our SF vacation. Man I wish we had this place back at home. Go get some!
First off, this is the most expensive sandwich we've ever had.The food: we ordered Spiffy Tiffy and Mnage a Trois. We added to both sandwiches two small bags of chips and two bottled water. Our order came out to over $31. The Spiffy Tiffy really lacked flavor. It seemed like a popular sandwich but I don't see what the appeal is. I like that it has avocado but the chicken didn't have any flavor. The Mnage a Trois sandwich on the other hand was really good. Full of flavor and much tastier than the Spiffy Tiffy. If you're going to this restaurant we'd recommend the Mnage a Trois sandwich.The service: There is no place to really sit and have a meal. This is more of a place where you get in line, order, and go. The person at the counter was nice.Overall, we were surprised when the person behind the register gave our total. For the taste of the food and the price, I don't think it's worth it. It's way too pricey. We're open to trying new food and sometimes we find places that become our favorite. This sandwich shop, unfortunately isn't our favorite. If I'm going to spend $31, it won't be on a sandwich.
Hey Ike! I don't know what you put in your sandwiches but DAMN. One bite and my friend and I were utterly smitten. Skeptical we were at first, for the ingredients sound mighty ordinary on the menu. Halal chicken, sliced brisket, or some vegan variety of protein plus your typical sandwich cheese, and choice of lettuce, tomato, banana peppers, jalapenos. Some sandwiches have additional ingredients like fried jalapeno poppers, onion rings, avocado, and the like.  Frankly I thought this would be a lot like Potbelly's - some customization for a good, but not 20-minute wait good, sandwich.I was wrong. There is something addicting about the combination of flavors, perhaps a secret in the sauce they douse the sandwich in. Or maybe it's not even a sauce but the goodness of a natural marriage of flavors that I'm tasting. The Dutch crunch bread was good, I still have no idea what it is but I don't really care. One review said it was "like tiger bread," which apparently was supposed to clarify things for me. Maybe it's a Californian thing. My friend, after a few mouthfuls of the Dutch crunch bread, had an epiphany: "It tastes just like Olive Garden breadsticks!" That is, in a good way.  The bread's outside is crunchy, the innards soft and pillowy. This is not a sandwich that would hold up well over long distances (say, from CA to NY. I contemplated it).  This was our first stop of on our impromptu SF trip as it was close to the bnb we stayed at, and it did not disappoint. Dolores park was closed, so we ate, basking in the sun, upon the white steps of the high school with a full view of the careful destruction (and hopefully re-construction) of the park. Part of the joy of the experience was remembering that I was no longer a high school student. Followed by Bi-Rite immediately after (without a line, a lucky timing on our part I later learned), Ike's has now become a joyous memory of an epic first meal and introduction to SF eats.  When (not if) I return to SF, I will make a stop at Ike's to try another sandwich.  Precious time and stomach space I don't easily dole out!I had the Bella, my friend the Spiffy Tiffy with fried chicken, that first go. We bookended our trip with a return to Ike's where I satisfied my curiosity regarding the vegan meatballs of Meatless Mike. While the second experience was not as mind-blowing as the first, the only regret I have was finishing the whole sandwich and being too full to have anything from Tartine afterwards.  Sorry Tartine, the siren call of Ike's was too strong. To avoid the line, call ahead or order online to pick up. Thanks to Jando and Ruggy for your reviews, which played no small part in convincing me to give this place a try.
Just like all of the other Ike's I've ever been to, this place more than lives up to its reputation.Not only that, but this place lets you get a free soda (this includes their entire collection of weird off-the-wall type bottled drinks, like Leninade) if you pay using cash. Not bad at all.Menage a trois forever.
12/8/2015: After all these years living in SF, I finally ate at iKe's today. I always avoided it because every time I passed by, there were long lines and average serving time was around 45mins. Today, I went there around 3:30pm, was the first person in a totally empty place and got my sandwich in about 7 minutes. I ordered The Backstabber, appropriately named after some of my coworkers and so-called friends! Unlike the backstabbers in our real lives, It was very innocently delicious. Can't wait to go back and try a few other things on their menu. Oh did I mention that if you go between 3-6pm, you get a free soda and bag of chips?!12/24/2015: I tried the Hollywood SF Philly cheese stake today with no lettuce/tomato plus onions on dutch crunch. Yum, to die for.
It's mostly hype.Sure the sandwhich tastes great, but it's not worth the crowds, the waiting, nor the price.I ordered though tryCaviar.com for delivery because I'm not waiting 30 min in line for any kind of food! But I wanted to see what all the hype was all about. So I ordered their hyped up Kryptonite. The one featured on Man vs. Food. Caviar's website claims it's 24 inches! I even had to order 24hrs in advance! Turns out it's just two regular sized sandwiches 8" each. Yes that comes to 16" total! To be fair, Ike's website never claims it's 24". That's Caviar's fault for calling it a 24" Monster! But I'm sure Ike had to approve of those descriptions right?It tasted great. But not so good that I would ever order again or wait in line. There's plenty of sandwhich shops all around that tastes just as good. Lou's Cafe is pretty similar.Check out my pic.
This is how I imagine a perfect day in the city to be - it's mid 70's with sun beaming, and we're hanging out at Dolores park with a 40 in hand. We get a little hungry so we say, hey, let's go down to Ikes! So we walk to Ikes, order two Spiffy Tiffy's, head back to Dolores park, eat our sammiches, then get some Bi-Rite (Ricanelas, please!) and then take a nap at the park. That's usually how me and the boyfriend gets it done. Trust me, it may seem like a little bit of a process, but it's the most perfect day when you have a free afternoon. The Spiffy Tiffy is one of my favorite sandwiches at Ike's. It has halal chicken breast, avocado, pesto, mushroom, provolone AND pepper jack cheese. Slap all that onto a dutch crunch, and you are all set baby! THENNNNN, you also get a bag o' chips and a caramel apple lollipop to top it all off! The sandwich is delicious. It comes in like a foot long, and I can only eat half in one sitting. I would share my other half because theres alot of sauce on it so saving it for "later" usually equals soggy sandwhich which is a NOOOO THANK YOU!Bottom line, just go! All of the sandwiches are delicious. You can look on line to see their extensive menu. The one on the board inside the shop is just a sneak peak! Also, i would call in advance so your sandwich will be ready when you get there. Parking is kind of hard, but if you don't mind walking a few city blocks, it shouldnt be a problem.
Saw this place on man vs food so I thought why not I didn't care for this place but maybe it's what I ordered maybe I'll have to give it another try
This place receives the great reviews and hypes everywhere! What's so great about this place? Well for starters, they have a HUGE menu and I think it varies slightly from location to location (ex. LA will have a different menu from what we have here in the bay) but I think the main staples of the place is still there. I've been to both the Oakland location and the SF locations and they are about the same size. A bit easier to find parking near the Oakland location but these are really hit or miss as most people wouldn't drive in SF anyways. The lines for these famous Ike's are usually pretty long (SF is way longer on the weekends-20 minute line at least). We went for a picnic on a Sunday and Ike's was near it so we had to get a sandwich there as our lunch time picnic meal! and that wait was ridiculous. We ordered, walked 5 blocks out to a store to buy some chocolate to pair with our wine for the picnic, came back and our sandwiches were still not ready! How long can it take to make a sandwich? Well I guess if you are 1 of 100 customers waiting, it can take a while! The sandwich itself was pretty good, not sure whether it was worth the wait though. I never think anything is worth over a 20 minute wait. The dutch crunch bread is pretty crazily good though. I suggest getting that. We got a discount from our meal because we downloaded an app that just launched that gave us $10 of credit so our 2 sandwiches was like $5 total. You get a free apple lollipop with your sandwich! Tips: 1) Go early!2) Check yelp for a check in to get a free bag of chips3) Enjoy
First of all, the sandwiches are amazing. The people working there are good too. The reason I'm giving it a 3 is because of the wait. My wife and I waited almost an hour and a half for our sandwiches, which is just not ok unless you like wasting your day. I've been to the one in Concord too and it's wait was about 15 min. He really needs a bigger building and more cooks to match the demand. If you do go, try to go at an odd hour so the wait won't be bad
Ya like this place really needs another review, but I'll let you know what I ordered in hopes that it will help you navigate the deliciousness that awaits you.Lincecum has ham, turkey, and bacon. 3 types of meat! And half the sandwich is avacado. If you love meat and avacado, you must get this one. As for the bread, go with the dutch roll. Crunchy (not hard) but sooo soft on the inside. And you get a caramel apple lollipop for dessert!
I'm halfway through my Tony Soprano add pickles, and I am taking a break for two reasons. One. I'm pretty small and this sandwich is pretty not small. Two. I don't care how many people have reviewed this deserving sandwich joint, I want to put in my two cents. My love of this place needs to be heard, so listen up:This is the best sandwich place in the entire fucking world. I tried my doll's The Forty, and it's crazy. Chicken fried steak, cheddar ordered double dirty. Double delicious. The Tony Soprano chosen by yours truly, is basically the greatest cold cut sandwich of all time. The motto here is Love and Sandwiches. I love them and their sandwiches, and so will you.
The sandwiches here are absolutely amazing. The staff is super friendly and nice. Only downside is sometimes it seems like it takes a little while for you to get your sandwich. If it's real busy be prepared to wait 30+ min for your sandwich to come!
Yea, it lives up to the hype. Got the sliced rob eye sandwich and the chicken sandwich with green chillies. Loved the Dutch crunch, loved the dirty sauce.
if you love sandwiches, this place will not disappoint. there is usually quite a dumb long line tho, so be prepared to wait about 30-45 to get your food. i always get the hot mamma huda, basically a buffalo chicken sandwich. theres a couple reasons these sandwiches are so good, one is the dutch crunch bread, but the other is cause they shred the chicken, so it soaks up the flavor, and everything doesnt fall out when you take a bite, you get just the right amount every time. they know what they are doing, the hype is real. perfect to eat at the park.
I've tried the Menage a trois and Spiffy Tiffy, and I'd recommend both to everyone in the whole world. So delicious and addicting. I called in my order, was put on hold for 5 minutes, then was told to come in 20 mins to pick it up. I came on time, and voila, the order was ready for me to gobble up. It was cold outside, so we just ate in the car, since there was no place to sit. SO YUMMY
Was DRAGGED here by an IKE'S FAN :DI had the Philly Cheesteak, which isn't out of the world.. if you're ever in the Portland area, you must go to SHUT UP & EAT and have theirs. The line was nearly out the door, so it must be good :)The sandwiches are nice size, with lots of options for extras, different types of soda, chips.. I'd come back and try a different sandwichSome general seating would be a nice add, but I guess.. if it ain't broke, don't fix it !
The customer service in this place is pathetic; they act like they're doing you a favor. Only one surly guy was at the register, and there was only 1 person ahead of us. But he took his sweet time about it, wasn't friendly at all, and after we'd waited for nearly 15 minutes without even our order being taken, we left. Really guys? Bad customer service, and lousy attitude is a long-term death of any business as soon as the economy dies down...as it always has.
Be prepared to wait, and the online ordering service through yelp is a bit frustrating. That being said, I will keep going back time and time again for the Secret Kitty.
Never order delivery. It took 3 hours. Not worth it.
Holy Name Panthers, how I still crave you. I can't get you out of my mind. I think I'm in love with you and without you, life will never be the same!P.S. I seriously need to move to San Francisco!
Best vegan sandwich place in town! I love the vegan pilgrim and have a goal to try all of the vegan sandwiches! Make sure they give you the vegan lollipop with your sandwich. Sometimes they mess that up. :(
I use to think Ike's was the best gluten free sandwich around... the SF branch because their GF bread was better than the other Ike's which seem to use bread similar to the frozen stuff at the grocery stores. Now the SF branch is using the GF bread the other Ike's are using which is crappy. I am sincerely disappointed. It definitely decreases the quality of the sandwich.
Damn good sandwich in such a small place. We went at night so everything was dark, and the place seemed really old. I started off disappointed, until I got my sandwich. It brightened up my day. I was so amazed.
Got the mnage a trois per yelper recommendations but it tasted like a regular sandwich to me. Good but not great. Not worth the hype in my opinion.
I honestly don't get the huge hype with this place. I don't remember what sandwich I had but it had roast beef and artichoke hearts. I've definitely had better sandwiches and at almost $10, this place is so not worth it. The staff was really nice and was more than happy to answer any questions about the sauces on the menu, and I like how they gave free lollipops at the end. Ike's doesn't have a lot of seating, nor do they offer water cups, so I would make sure to get it to go and eat at Dolores Park, and bring a water bottle, unless you want to pay for a bottle. I probably wouldn't come back again, and I'll gladly stick to Montague's in Berkeley.
I HAVE A REALLY COOL STORY BOUT THIS PLACE.I was visiting from out of town with some good friends and we had spent our sunny afternoon in Dolores Park. On our way back through the Castro we decided to stop by, noting very positive reviews on Yelp. My friend got a vegetarian sandwich and two bags of chips for me and another friend because we were broke as heck. Waited in line for about 15 to 20 minutes and struck up conversations with some of the friendly customers. The wait itself was inconsequential and my friend received his sandwich and enjoyed it greatly. This is where the cool part of the story comes in. So my friend finishes his sandwich and we're munching on chips. A fellow who works at Ikes approaches us and asks us how we enjoyed our food. My friend replied saying its great sandwich and would come again. Me and my other friend who did not buy a sandwich said we enjoyed the atmosphere and chips were darn good. He asked us why we didn't buy sandwich. we responded that we had no money with us, to which he replied, & I quote: "that's no reason not to eat!" He bustled off and before we knew it, he returned, first with a caramel apple lollipop, and then with a whole roast beef and smoked gouda sandwich, gratis! We thanked him profusely and enjoyed a lovely conversation about our trip in San Francisco before he headed back into work. I've never experienced a level of such casual compassion in a restaurant. We were flabbergasted by his care of his customers and non customers. The sandwich itself was excellent. The "dirty" sauce is their secret to success. As my starving friend and I polished up the sandwich, we observed the paper bag it came in. We noticed that the cartoon figure on the bag bore an uncanny resemblance to the gentleman that hooked it up with the delicious sandwich.... so we put two and two together and realized that it was the radiant hero of legend, IKE himself who had helped us! The owner himself had gone so far out of his way just to offer some hungry kids delicious food; clearly Ike cares about the folks that come into his establishment and has a very deep passion for his craft. I will never forget this experience.I'd give this place 20 stars if I could.
Messy & delicious unique sandwiches. First time in this past weekend, I had the Mnage a trios. Excellent, order it and walk down to Dolores Park to eat with a 6-pk of beer. The best San Francisco experience one can have! Plenty of "independent merchants" there at the park are happy to sell you a rather"cosmic desert" that only makes the experience that much more memorable. I still can't figure out what that smell in the air was... ;-D
"They're just sandwiches," says my friend as we're waiting in line."But ARE THEY???" I question.I tried this place with my friends for the first time. I mean if there's over 5000 reviews for it on Yelp, you just gotta try it, right? There was a long-ass line out the door onto the street (not that I expected any less). I think we waited about 20 minutes just to get inside the restaurant and then about 10 minutes to get our food. But it was ENTIRELY worth it. I am a big lover of sandwiches. I believe sandwiches exist to make our lives easier and more joyful. The selection of sandwiches here is INSANE! Not only is there the menu on the wall, but there are also secret little items posted throughout the store and on their website as well. I got a little anxious trying to decide what to get because they all sounded pretty good to me! This place is amazing because they have they seem to have an extensive vegetarian/vegan menu as well, so there is probably something for everyone to enjoy. I ended up choosing the "Zivity", which was one of the items posted on a separate piece of paper on another wall. It had a lot of stuff that I don't completely remember, but it definitely had halal chicken, salami, pesto, and Swiss cheese, I believe. Holy crap. Probably one of the best sandwich experiences of my life. The sandwich is pretty big and it's loaded with flavor. It saucy and meaty and just tasted SO good. I got it on their famous "Dutch Crunch" bread and that was really great. I only managed to finish about 60% of the sandwich on the first go, but that was alright because it meant more for later!The sandwich also came with a bag of chips. They have an awesome selection of unique kinds of chips as well. I went with the Voodoo chips and they were kinda spicy and really good! Ike's has a bunch of different sodas as well, but I didn't get one.I am so satisfied with my experience here and I believe my friends are as well. This is the kind of sandwich I have dreams about, but there are still so many more to try!
Beyond my expectations of a sandwich! Just fell in love with the first bite. Thanks Ike!
Holy frijoles! What great sandwiches!!Proving yet again that I'm slow on the uptake, just stopped by Ike's for the 1st time, to FINALLY try their veggie sandwich fareThe menu is extensive, to the point it's hard to narrow down choices - we veggies are not used to this! We usually get 1 or 2 items to fit our needs but here, the choices are endless.......and should point out that the online menu is MUCH more comprehensive than what you see on their sandwich board - so if it's not up there on the board, don't be bashful - you can still order it!!So after much debate & discussion, the Mr & I shared the following ( on Dutch Crunch of course! )Love Triangle - BBQ, Cheddar, Honey Mustard, Pepper Jack, Real Honey, Swiss, Vegan Breaded Chicken. Loved the tang of the sauce & all the different cheesesWario - Marinara, Mozzarella Sticks, Vegan Meatballs. Yeah, you read right, there were CHEESE STICKS on the sandwich & they were heavenly!!! I also super-appreciated how they sliced the meatballs in half so the flat part was against the bread & didn't slide all over the sandwich / out of the bread. Why didn't I ever think of this??Can't really say which was the best of the bunch b/c they were both incredibly tasty! At first bite of the Wario, I thought the other sandwich isn't going to be as good as this.... but it was!Also loving the fact they had the Voodoo Chips - those things rock!Where the heck have I been all this time?? It hasn't been in the famous Ike's lines & all the worse for me.....we'll be fixing this error & often! Like, maybe, today!
I was impressed when I tried Ike's for the first time couple years ago and I was back in SF recently so we definitely had to go back!No other sandwich place compares to this one...The wait wasn't as long as the first time and I was ordering at the counter in about 15 minutes! I went with the Menage a Troi on crunch dutch bread.Every sandwich there is excellent, it really just depends on your mood that day.There also have a great selection of unique chips to choose from.I always get a Leninade from the drink fridge too!There are a few chairs to sit on while waiting for your order.A woman will bring them out in brown bags and call your name.There aren't any tables to eat it so you can park it on the curb or just take it to-go!The sandwich is HUGE! It's around $12 each but super worth it!
I love love LOVE ike's!!! I made it a habit to always visit ike's whenever i'm in my hometown during school breaks (I attend college in socal) because I love ike's sandwiches that much. I haven't really found a place in socal with such unique sandwiches and I guess that's why I miss ike's so much--the great combinations!!Usually I opt for the spiffy tiffy, name of the girl i'm dating, jim rome, or the menage a trios on dutch crunch! All in all, you can't go wrong with any sandwich from here. Only bad thing is that the dutch crunch is so crunchy that the roof of my mouth gets a little cut up (I can hang though... especially for an ike's sandwich).The service is also really great. One time I wanted to save a sandwich for later so I wanted to leave out the avocado, so I ordered a sandwich (don't remember which one) and the cashier actually tried to find the cheapest alternative for my sandwich because she knew avocado costed more! I thought that was really considerate of her.The orders all come with a bag of chips and a caramel apple lollipop! My favorite bag of chips is the voodoo! The caramel apple lollipop is great too, very reminiscent of childhood haha. :)Overall a really great sandwich spot in SF!
Be sure to get the Godfather sauce on any of the sammies you purchase. It makes ALL the difference. Trust.
What the hell happened to this place? I don't know but they have really gone downhill in the past couple of years. First off, update your damn yelp page. Don't believe any of the prices- my sandwich, the spiffy tiffy, says it's $10 here. NOPE. $12. Only found out when j went to pay. When I get there, it's nothing but attitude. Hey man, I get it. We've all been there. But don't dump your shitty attitude on me. I guess the icing on the cake was the lack of lollipop, specifically after the guy on the phone went out of his way to tell me about the lollipops. I've been a pretty loyal customer but this experience was . There's too many other sandwich spots to get treated like that.
In Ike's we trust. Matt Cain with Dutch Crunch all day.
This is not your typical sandwich. It's *THE* sandwich! The place is small and cozy (not really much of an eating area). You line up to make your order and you have the choice of ordering your sandwich with wheat, Ike's famous Dutch Crunch bread, etc. I highly recommend the Dutch Crunch!!We ordered...Spiffy Tiffy: halal chicken breast, pesto, avocado, mushroom, provolone and pepper jack cheese. DELICIOUS! Let me just warn you that this sandwich is HUGE! Very filling and the combination of all the ingredients made the trip worthwhile. Highly recommend! (5/5)Hot Mama Huda: halal chicken, buffalo wing sauce, ranch and provolone. This is an underrated selection. The sandwich is warm and absolutely yummy as compared to the Spiffy Tiffy, which is a more "colder" sandwich. Very good and filling. (5/5)Any sandwich order comes with some chips on the side! Some of their popular specialty ones include the Voodoo chips. It's pretty good! It's a mix of BBQ and Cajun! YUM YUM!TIP: **There's free parking on Church street (we came here on a Sunday), which is literally a walk away from Ike's. Other than that, you may need to find meter parking. I don't think there's any parking garages nearby.
I ALWAYS get the menage a trois at the Ike's at SFSU. This time I decided to get it here. I asked them to remake the sandwhich because it was lacking ANY sauce. Even after remaking it, the sandwhich came out without any sauce. Absolutely ridiculous to pay $15 and no have a decent sandwhich the way it is supposed to be come out
Heard about this place on the Food Network, thought I'd give it a try! If you're indecisive like me, look on their website first to narrow down your sandwich choices because they have a pretty extensive list. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff, and truly amazing sandwiches. Worth the price!
Doesn't get better than these sandwiches. Try the Menage A Trois!Also Ike is da man, super friendly & awesome!
You've never had a real sandwich until you've tried Ike's. My usual routine was to grab Ike's and stop by Dolores Park to relax and enjoy my sandwich.I've always gone with a group of friends and for some reason, each time we all decided to order a sandwich and share. Ike's was nice enough to cut them into 3's for us. I always ordered the Menage A Trois, Spiffy Tiffy, and Paul Reubens. All were amazing with lots of flavor and textures that complimented each other. It can get a bit messy luckily they give you napkins. You honestly can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches. They also come with a bag of chips and my fave, a caramel apple pop (reminds me of childhood)The line is always long every time I've been there. But it's definitely worth the wait. I will definitely return, my goal is to try all their sandwiches.
I'm going to keep it short and sweet. I just ate the best sandwich of my life: the mnage a trois on dutch crutch. This sandwich is nothing short of perfect. Even though I felt ill from eating the entire humongous sandwich I was still so sad when I finished it.Note: eat the mnage immediately after buying it or else all of the sauces will weigh it down and the sandwich will get soggy
I wish I lived in San Francisco so that I could go to Ike's everyday. It was one of my must haves during my short mini vacation to sf. I was not disappointed. I had the mason bumgarner and it was aaaaaaaamazing. I'm salivating just thinking about it right now. Makes me want to hop on a plane and buy another one. I must go back. I must try all the sandwiches. I think I'm in love.
Amazing sandwiches hands down! Lots of different variety and very filling. A clear favorite for many people as the lines are almost always long and if you order ahead you have to wait a good 35 minutes before heading over. With that being said the service is surprisingly very slow. You see lots of employees in the back working, none rushing around and seem to take their time making sandwiches. The front registers staff are inconsistent with who helps who. Sometimes one person works both the pick up order register and the walk in register both with long lines in them. I end up waiting far shorter for food if I went to a sit down restaurant. The establishment itself is dumpy looking which is odd seeing how there so successful and multiple locations but aren't investing more love into trying to make their place look better.Like I said, food is really good, but that's the only best part
If you eat here - keep your receipt and monitor your credit card company closely!!! I'm not complaining about the money ($2) but we ordered one sandwich to-go (not like there's space to eat here anyhow) - I did not tip. Checked my statement a few days later, it turns out the cashier (bald guy) decided to add a few extra dollars onto the tab!!! That is so illegal and unethical for business practices. At first I thought I misread the amount but when I found the receipt, sure enough he added something extra that he was not entitled to. Such a shady business!!!!! Will consider reporting them.
Delicious! The mnage-a-trois on Dutch crunch bread is amazing. Mmmmmmm......We stopped here while visiting San Francisco, and decided we HAD to stop in again before our flight out. It' THAT good. I'm back in Dallas and I miss Ike's terribly....
We live next to Ike's and have been suffering from it's irresponsible business conduct for years. For as long as the business has been in our neighborhood we have not tried its sandwiches. The place looks unsanitary and it allows its customers to eat their sandwiches on our front porch. On a daily basis we come home with sauces and crump from Ike's sandwiches. Occasionally, when we asked Ike's customers to move away from our porch, we were confronted by angry people who called us faggots, refused to leave our property, and threatened us physically.We have never once seen Ike's clean the sidewalk in front of their store, unlike other food operations in our neighborhood. It is dirty, filthy, and smelly, and all of our neighbor's steps are soiled with Ike's "delicious dirty" sauce. Ike's cares about its profit margin, but not so much when it comes to the well being of its neighbor.We have made multiple requests to Ike's to improve the increasingly hostile and unbearable situations. But all have fallen on deaf ears. There are also quite a few drunk patrons, who, when confronted, spouted homophobic slurs and acted in a physically violent way.We hope Ike's would act responsibly to coexist with its neighbor. Though it's unlikely given they never rectified the situations and acted in a proactive way.We should not have to deal with our property being vandalized or trespassed, nor should we fear for our safety in our own homes. Being called faggots by Ike's patrons in the heart of the Castro is a surreal experience. The fear is that one day a hate crime would happen, and then it will be too late.
Great service, great sandwiches, also quite an interesting selection of bottled sodas to choose from. The sandwiches are reasonably priced and the variety is huge considering there are many more sandwiches available to order that are listed on their website. Also I am a huge fan of mozzarella sticks on the sandwiches. Over all great place with great sandwiches, would definitely come here again.
One of the places you MUST have to go when you are in San Francisco.Ike's Place is NO JOKE.Best Sandwich with over 50 selections.I usually get their Spiffy Tiffy ($ 10.00) What's Inside?Avocado, Halal Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepper Jack, Pesto, ProvoloneBut must warn you... Once you take the first bite.. You'll never Want to go to any sandwich place. The Pesto sauce dripping into your fingers that makes you want to lick it!.I wish he was in NY.....
Ordered over the phone at 2pm and was told it would be ready by 3:10pm. I got there at 3:20pm and had to wait till 4pm till my sandwich was ready. It was cold and soggy by the time I got to eat it. Will NEVER come to this location. The one in Oakland is much better.
You will literally wait 30 minutes to an hour. 30 minutes is only if there is nobody in line. The food may taste good, but that's probably because you're starving by the time you get it!
One of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life. I've been to this place a couple times now and I always come here when I'm up in the Bay Area.The Matt Kane is my sandwich of choice and it never disappoints. I add avocado to it. Everything is great except the line. You can easily wait 30-45 minutes at lunch time but it's all about where you eat your sandwich. I like going to Dolores park and eating with a view.
Called in a phone order at 11:35 am (time on receipt) for pick-up at 12:15 pm. I wasn't given any warning that they were backed up and behind on sandwiches at all. When I got there at 12:30 pm expecting my sammies to be waiting I was surprised that only 3/4 were done. I waited an extra 20 minutes (left there at 12:50 pm) for that ONE SANDWICH! The wait isn't what killed me though, it was the girl standing there who was supposed to be helping everyone with phone/online orders and couldn't answer simple questions. Multiple people were asking for the manager and requesting refunds but her reply was that she 'doesn't know how to handle the situation' or 'isn't sure'. Someone should have saved her because she was a sinking ship. Her lack of information and lack of initiative to find someone with answers was just as bad as the wait time. When I asked her how long until my sandwich would be done and her response was, "I don't know how to tell how long it will take, I'm not sure what to do," I was beyond annoyed, along with the rest of the patrons. The least she could have done was ask the kitchen or at least pretend to!Word to the wise: The worst response you can give your customers is an 'I don't know' followed up with a dazed look. If you don't know - you better ask.
Hands down the best sandwiches in San Francisco, maybe in the country! I have never actually been to the Ike's Place location in the Castro but I get the sandwiches delivered through Caviar delivery. Have tried the Backstabber, Blind Date, Jim Rome, Matt Cain and Heath Ledger sandwiches. Probably my favorite is Matt Cain which has a few different types of meat. All are delicious, and usually get them on Dutch Crunch which is their best bread! I like that they do have vegan options and vegetarian options as well so pretty much everyone can find something they like here! The sandwiches are pretty big so might be good for two meals, or one meal if you are really hungry :)If you are addicted to their sandwiches but don't want to take the time to go there, recommend ordering through Caviar, or ordering ahead of time and then picking up since it can take some time!
Usual is not the norm here. Get that Subway melody out of your head and think: $11, $11 foot long!!" Actually, it's probably less than a foot long but you get a bag of chips!Obviously this is a local favorite where you can make a pit stop to order a satisfying sandwich. My choice:Menage a trois - BBQ, Cheddar, Halal Chicken, Honey Mustard, Pepper Jack, Swiss on a dutch rollEXCELLENT!!Catchy name? You should see the other names they had. If I were to come back, I'd order: Elvis Kieth, We're Just Friends or the Nacho Girl. Heck this mega sandwich was a gutt buster! If you're a light eater, you can easily make this into two meals but why?!?Advice .... Do not eat and drive at the same time. From experience, I was consuming it while driving and the sauce was dripping all on my lap which I fortunately had covered with napkins.Definitely call in your order at least an hour before you're ready to pick it up. Parking, yes it's very difficult but come on your taste buds will thank you.
We finally got to try the Ike's Place. We were lucky to skip any waiting time, since we went post lunch on a Friday evening. Cashier was very friendly, and encouraged all the people in queue (around 10) to take their time and ask questions on menu. It was great to see that level of service in a busy restaurant. We ordered 1 Spiffy Tiffy, which is not on menu. Must say it was delicious and portion was huge almost like 2 fat burgers. Best thing is the proximity to Dolores Park, calls for a perfect picnic pick !
A must-try, one-of-a-kind sandwich place in San Fran! The place is located close by Mission Dolores Park. It is recommended if you go by public transport, since parking is limited in the area. We went around 1pm on a weekend, so we weren't surprised that there was a long line when we got there. But the wait was very short (~10 min) and the order was quick. If you pay by cash, you can get a drink (water/can of soda) for free. You also get a lollipop for free. We waited about 10 minutes for the sandwiches to get ready. There is no place to sit in the restaurant, so if you are planning to dine-in...you should probably check out another place. But if you don't mind walking a little, you can walk to Mission Dolores Park (10 min walk) or find outside dining table to sit down if you are lucky. The park is very relaxing and is the perfect place for a picnic. Make sure to bring a blanket if you do decide to go! The sandwich was DELICIOUS! I got the Hot Momma Huda for ~$10, which had buffalo wing sauce, Halal chicken, provolone, ranch. The portion was HUGE (definitely enough for 2 meals)! The meat was shredded and marinated perfectly, and the bread (which you can pick when you order) was very soft. Make sure to get a lot of tissue because they are very generous on the sauce!
Why have I not written a review for this place yet? This place is amazing! I love myself a good sandwich and here at Ike's they make a damn good one. They have a huge menu, they probably make over 100 different variety of sandwiches and you can also customize them to your liking. I think their prices are fair considering the size of the sandwiches, they are pretty big. I usually only eat half and save the other half for later.Whichever sandwich you do decide to get, I would recommend you eat it on their freshly baked Dutch crunch bread. It's soft inside and crunchy outside, delicious! It seems like I've had quite a few of their sandwiches, but in reality it's only about ten percent of their whole menu. Some of my favorites include the Spiffy Tiffy & Lincecum sandwiches. My only gripe is their lines... Which I hate to wait in when I'm hungry. They do move fairly quickly, but even then you end up waiting for at least half an hour to get through the line, order and get your sandwich. But you can avoid the lines of you just call your order in before you head over there and just go in and pick it up.
I this this place is a really good deal for the price! The sandwiches are HUGE and will keep you full for the whole day if you can eat it all in one sitting. A lot of the girl friends we went to just ate half.Spiffy Tiffy = WOW, so good *o* I love their pesto sauce. Definitely try it out! dutch crunch roll = a mustMy friends say that the cranberry + turkey one is really good too. I don't like cranberries or turkeys, but if you're fan of thanksgiving, you should definitely try it out :) You also get a free bag of chips with your sandwich.For a guaranteed fun time, buy your sandwiches and go to dolores park to hang out! It's really close walking distance and a great place to eat your great lunch on a great sunny day :D4 stars because... although this place is really good... and is truly above average for sandwich places........... I do think it is a little overhyped, and this isn't the BEST one I've been to. (If you're in the SD area, you should check out Board & Brew. THOSE are the best sandwiches!!)
I never had an amazing experience here. Am I missing something? Maybe I keep getting the wrong sandwich? Maybe I am the crazy one? Beats me. I guess I just do not see the hype of this place. You pay over $12 for a sandwich, you wait a long time, and the end result is mediocre.It was Sunday, and I was craving a sandwich to eat at Dolores Park. I have tried Ike's in the past, but was never too crazy about it . But hey, that was a few years ago, maybe my taste buds changed? I thought, today will be the day I fall and love. Not. I got the Bear Hug sandwich. It was thinly sliced rib eye steak with a couple of sauces. The meat content was on cheap side, real cheap. The dutch crutch consumed the majority of my sandwich and the taste profile, was really just OK. I had the Reuben in the past, and it was significantly better then this sandwich. So in the event of a toss between the two, go for the Reuben. Besides tasting better, you will get the nod of approval from your Hebrew friends. Maybe me and Ike's were not meant to be friends? For a good sandwich, go to Roxie's or Molinari's. Those two joints never seem to fail me while in the mood for a good sandwich.
Long lines are deserved! Great food that necessitates a second visit. plan on taking your sandwich to Dolores Park a few blocks away as it's worth the people watching
The nacho girl, sf giants and Hollywood's sf cheese steak.All 3 were great. Tip: add mozzarella sticks to everything lolTheir root beer was delicious and perfect after a great sandwich. Anyone that can put salmon (nacho girl) in a sandwich with avocado makes a pretty dang good thing!Look up the menu before hand to pick which creation you want to try, although you may have more than enough time waiting in the line up. Ask for hot peppers on the side to spice things up. You can also order sandwiches ahead of time for pick up.Their kettle chips were just okay.
The best!! I love this spot the fat bastard is soooo good. It has bacon, ham, American, and I got all the free fixins and added avocado
Love Ike's!! I don't really like sandwiches that much but with so many reviews and 4.5 stars, I had to try it. I was blown away. The second time I was there I ordered another sandwich and it didn't dot my taste so I decided to stick with what I loved in the beginning.
This place is a definite must try when visiting in San Francisco! I was recommended this place by my cousin and wanted to see what all the hype was about. There was a line coming out of the door and along the wall outside but the wait passed by pretty fast. It's faster if you called in so you don't have to wait! I shall remember that for next time. I asked one of the girl workers for the best choice for a person who doesn't eat beef. She recommended the "Spiffy Tiffy " and "Menouge se Trois". I went with the first one and it was absolutely mouthwatering! the halal chicken is to die for. You will not be disappointed. Also comes with a bag of chips! I am definitely coming back for more during my next visit!I would recommend buying the sandwich and then walking to Dolores Park which is a few blocks away. Perfect people watching and lunch area.
I came here Saturday for lunch to see what 6000+ reviews on yelp tasted like and if it could really live up to the hype and boy did this place deliver. I waited for around 45 minutes to get my food but only because of how long the line was and not because they were slow. The wait was well worth it and by the time I got my sandwich I was starving, which made the sandwich that much better. I ordered the mnage a trois on sourdough (although I realized afterwards that their Dutch crunch bread is all the rage) and the sandwich wasn't small but it also wasn't completely filling. The ingredients in the sandwich were amazing though, the chicken inside was juicy and flavorful and the fresh veggies gave the sandwich a nice crunch, what made the sandwich even better was their sauces, the bbq and the hint of honey made the sandwich really amazing.This place has a lot of original sandwich combinations with a large assortment of meats, sauces, and breads for you to choose from so whatever you feel like getting you should be able to find here. I plan on coming back for sure and trying their other sandwiches!
I love this place so much. Both the food and customer service is fantastic. I came to this location for the first time for a late lunch (2:00) on a Wednesday and the line was still out the door. After waiting about half an hour I placed my order and it was ready in about 15 minutes. When I was there they gave free water/soda and chips with every sandwich, which was awesome. There are two Ike's Places in San Francisco, the other being in the dungeon at San Francisco State University.I didn't have much interaction with the staff aside from ordering and receiving my food but every worker in the shop was friendly and had a smile on their face. The restaurant is pretty small so when it's busy (most of the time) the line goes out the door. There's no seating inside or outside, so don't expect to eat there. Like other reviewers, I recommend ordering online to avoid the line.The sandwiches here are amazing, the Dutch Crunch bread is a must. I would recommend the Matt Cain which comes with roast beef, pastrami, and turkey. It's flavorful and a perfect combination in my opinion. You really can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches, but the Matt Cain is my favorite. May seem a bit pricey for a sandwich $12 w/ tax but I think it's worth it. The SFSU location is cheaper by a couple dollars but it's even busier there.
One of the best sandwiches I've ever had! Maybe I'm overexaggerating or not? But I really love their sandwiches. No wonder there was a line out the door...the lines sure speak for itself. There's a wide selection to choose from whether you're in the mood for turkey, roast beef, halal chicken, pastrami, vegetarian, etc. Spiffy Tiffy is my favorite thus far. The halal chicken was tender, soft, and definitely not dry. Even though it's not on the menu you can still order it! I highly recommend. The pesto and avocado & the whole flavor just meshes well together. I bought a sandwich aka the Menage a Trois to-go for my sister and she loved it. The cashier told me that it was a good choice. A lot of people must love it! Dutch bread by far is the best bread choice. It's soft and fluffy with a soft crisp to it. I'm more of a wheat bread person though. Overall I say Ike's is pretty up there. If you're a sandwich lover then you should def. check this place out. I'm sure you would not regret it. You can even split a sandwich with a friend because it's pretty big and fulfilling. You can also download the Kash App to get $5 off your purchase!
I had been to a lot of locations, but this was my 1st one I visited in the City. I had a 2 reasons to stop by. 1) obviously to grab a Sammie 2) to grab an Anchorman Ike's T-shirt. I decided to get a new sandwich this time which was the Halal Chicken, Pepper jack cheese, Avocado, and Orange Zesty sauce. (Were Just Friends) The Sammie was very tasty on their trademark Dutch Crunch and the service was top notch. The Sandwich Gods were with me that day because I even grabbed an upfront parking place. Shirt is awesome and I will be sporting it while I'm on Vacation.
Really great sandwiches! Innovative! Fun! But, omg huge lines. Is it worth the line? Not sure.
If you have an hour to kill and don't mind waiting in line with sweaty 20 something's then this is the place you go to. They have 2 queues - one for paying for the sandwich and the other to find out how much longer it's going to take. It's beyond ridiculous. I live a block away and have been here twice. Both times were a disaster.
I'm giving this 3 stars because I like some of the friendly people who work there. I want to love this place, I really really do. The names of the sandwiches alone make me want to give another half a star, and the fact that each sandwich has its vegetarian sister sandwich is pretty neat. However, the sandwiches are just OK. And really not the healthiest choice. I don't mind this place for what it is, a sandwich shop close to the park with amazing dutch crunch, but the line you have to stand in to get your order in? Just not worth it for me. Maybe the line is part of the social experience for the young hipsteritos. But, ain't nobody got time for that.Updated:Ok, I'm gonna add an extra star because they do give you a free birthday sandwich. That makes 4 stars. Thank you Ike's for the birthday sandys.
Yea, IKEs is good.Some people are saying they waited to eat it, don't. Gotta be fresh!Ive tried the kryptonite, it was good, but i'm a Hella Fat Bastard myself.. I go turkey instead of ham, and get the B#### extra Dirty!! Yup, thats how we do!.These sandwiches are big, and full of everything they say on the menu. You won't get an avacado slice, you'll get a full avacado. That goes for everything in them.Don't know what exactly the dirty sauce is, but get extra of that!So for about 10 bucks, you can't go wrong
I've heard from several people that i had to try IKE's when I am in San Francisco.Never been to dolores park so decided to pick up Ike's on the way so we could sit down and munch!The line wasn't as long as I expected.. We ordered the kryptonite and menage a trios with avocados. I honestly think Ike's is alright.. not what i expected. I've tried Lou's before and think that Lou's is better than Ike's. The hype is not REAL (in my point of view)Maybe because we didn't eat it right away and took us awhile to get to Dolores. Made some pit stops eheheI rate it 3.5 stars, but give it 4 because of the sour apple lollipops they gave us,which was a pleasant surprise :)
The sandwiches here taste even better when you don't have to wait in a 15 to 30 minute line.Had it for my first time a little while ago and yes it was yummy. At the end of the day though I doubt any of their sandwiches are worth those long lines. Here's a hint: arrive an hour before closing and you won't regret it. Can't wait to try their 999+ other varieties.
Very intricate sandwiches but all very flavorful! Their sandwiches with halal chicken are right on point! They also offer these chips on the wall, they are sooooo good! Their dutch bread for sandwiches is amazingggg!
I wanted to enjoy this place....they are very friendly but.....sandwich was dry, tasteless and well boring. I had the bacon; pastrami and cheese. Dried out and yucky. Would i eat here again? No way. Pass.
my boyfriend and I came here for the first time and it was so good! I got #18 and he got #5. I didn't really like #5 only because it had mushrooms in it. but defiantly try #18! the reason why it got a four star and not a five is because it doesn't have any seats inside to eat so you have to take it togo..
I had a Menage A Trois.But before you judge me, let me explain: I had a Menage A Trois at Ike's Place. To clarify, the Menage A Trois is one of the many sandwiches that Ike's Place, a very popular sandwich shop at the intersection of Mission and Castro, has to offer.If you haven't stopped by Ike's Place before, you might be a little surprised by the appearance at first. It's a little divey and a little small. The different sandwiches are listed on the wall, with names like "Lincecum," "Pee Wee" and "Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian" (yes, really). The bathroom is awkwardly placed right where the line is, so that if there's a line (and yes, there usually is a line), you'll need to squirm through people to get in and out.But no matter. It's all about the sandwiches at this place. With no chairs or tables, there isn't a place to actually sit here. Like most people that come here, we decided to order our sandwiches to go and eat them at Dolores Park. After a quick walk over, we finally got to sit down and unwrap the sandwiches that were smelling oh-so fine.The Menage A Trois was described as having "BBQ, Cheddar, Honey Mustard, Pepper Jack and Halal." To quote my friend who was sharing the sandwich, "I don't know what halal is, but I like it!"Essentially, we were eating a barbecue chicken sandwich. Why it's called Menage A Trois still escapes me, but it was quite delicious. The bread was soft, the halal chicken was tender and savory... and that dirty dirty sauce they give you... goodness. It's very good.As we sat there on the hill, nibbling on our sandwiches, I felt very happy... and I think it was because my stomach was very happy too. Thanks Ike!
"Ike's Place" is hands down, the best sandwich shop in San Francisco! They offer so many different sandwich options, and great add on toppings to make your sandwich the best! They offer many vegetarian options as well! Order up anything on the menu with "Halal Chicken" for the best shredded chicken on a sandwich. Many sauces and breads to choose from, but personally love the "Dirty Sauce", and their "Dutch Crunch" bread is absolutely delicious. A must try in San Francisco!
Oh my god. A sandwich is one of those foods that make me think, "Hm... how good can a sandwich be... do I even want to pay for one?" Ike's made me take that thought, throw it out the window and make me want to throw my wallet at the cashier. I ordered the Spiffy Tiffy which sounds pretty basic with some Avocado, Halal Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepper Jack, Pesto, Provolone. It was seriously such an orgasmic experience of my mouth. The sandwiches are also huge that you probably don't even need the complimentary bag of chips (the spicy Louisiana ones are the best btw). I also stole a bite of the Menage A Trois (BBQ, Cheddar, Halal Chicken, Honey Mustard, Pepper Jack, Real Honey, Swiss) and while it was still really good, it was super sweet which is not how I like my sandwiches. I just wish there was more seating but there is a bench and some chairs (which is probably more for people waiting for their orders) and Dolores Park nearby so you can take your meal there. I can't wait to be back.
Truly the best sandwich I ever had. I can't tell you what made the sandwich so awesome, but it was, from the first bite to the last. None of that 'I ate all the meat, the last bite is just lettuce and bread' because Ike's takes care to carefully place the sandwich fillings. Sandwich is huge, for me it almost became two meals!(+) Spiffy Tiffy- Avocado, Halal Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepper Jack, Pesto, Provolone. You can really taste every component. Dirty sauce is snuck in each sandwich, which is the only thing can't describe right, except it must have made the sandwich more awesome. Chicken is shredded, making the texture tender and almost fluffy, so it's not just a hunk of chicken in your sandwich, but mingles with the other ingredients. Pesto and and creamy nuttiness is how I would describe the overall flavor. Loved it.Other Things:- A line reached the door on a Saturday night, but it moved along well, and gives you time to look at the immense menu- Don't forget to ask for the additional toppings on the menu if you want!- Almost no seating indoors, except for a few chairs, so you should have a plan to get it to go.
Bruh. Seriously one place you have to stop by if you are visiting San Francisco. Prices for sandwiches are somewhere between $7 and $13. #worth
I consider myself a fan of Ike's, but sadly today I had a negative experience. My Super Mario sandwich came absolutely dry and burned. How come???? Ike's is known for its juicy sandwiches so I'd never have expected something like this to happen, in my three years eating here it only takes once to be strongly disappointed. There was no marinara in the sandwich and that's the only dressing it was supposed to be added. Low point for that!
This is the best sandwich shop I have ever experienced. The meats are a little dry but that's fine as the sauces compliment it perfectly. The breads are always crunchy but soft and give the sandwiches a perfect ending.I recommend to order online as the line is stupid long and some of the customers don't understand the concept of waiting in line. The workers are always funny and professional and they seem to enjoy working.
My god, the Lex Luthor was HUGE! It costs $26, so i don't know if it's worth the price but it was a solid sandwich with really good bread (Dutch Crunch), tasty sauce and a ton of toppings - Breaded chicken, steak, mozzarella sticks, lettuce and tomato. We have a place like this in LA that's about $8-10 cheaper depending on what you order, and the ingredients taste fresher and of higher quality (Fat Sals) , but overall this place was still really good.
As most of these reviews say, these sandwiches are delicious and huge. I usually order the menage a trois, but I can only ever finish half of it. Sandwiches come with a free bag of chips and a candy!
Love Ike's. Delicious sandwiches. I highly recommend you get the Mnage-A-Trois. Check it out.
You know it's a 5 star sandwich when your friend asks for a bite and in your head, you're thinking "Nooooo, Do I really have to share with you?" And then you say "Fine..." Only because you feel good about yourself because "Sharing is Caring". Here are some of the sandwiches we got:Menage A Trois (11.11)BBQ, Cheddar, Halal Chicken, Honey Mustard, Pepper Jack, Real Honey, SwissThe most famous sandwich here, so of course I had to get it. That first bite though. My mouth exploded with flavor. You got the tenderness of the chicken, not dry at all and the sweetness of the honey mustard. The combination of everything together is amazing!yelp.com/biz_photos/ikesThe Damon Bruce (13.31)Beer Battered Onion Rings, Provolone, Steak Sauce, thinly sliced rib eye.Dammnnn. It was good, but I still liked mine better.yelp.com/biz_photos/ikesHot Momma Huda (8.98)Buffalo Wing Sauce, Halal Chicken, Provolone, RanchI don't really like buffalo sauce. So this was okay.( no picture :( ) Matt Cain (9.99)Godfather Sauce, Provolone, Roast Beef, Salami, Turkey My second favorite sandwich and also one of the more popular ones. This is meat on meat on meat. But the main star is that godfather sauce. Like a way better version of a flavored mayo. Godfather sauce, you definitely live up to it's name. ( no picture :( )Also, we got the siracha on the side. And holy smokes, their siracha is spicier than usual. I like siracha, but when I tried this I was like ":OOOOOO, get me water!!" I don't handle spicy well. We also got the cream soda, Yummy. First time trying cream soda and I would choose this over normal soda anyday. yelp.com/biz_photos/ikesVoodoo Chips: Whattttttttttt theeeee helll. I was so confused by the flavor of these. You get that sweetness but then you also get the salty vinegar flavor. So the best way to describe it is a sweet salt & vinegar chip. But somehow it works and it's damn addicting.yelp.com/biz_photos/ikesEvery sandwich comes with a spread of dirty sauce, so you don't need to ask for their secret sauce added to your sandwich. And their famous dutch crunch bread is amazing. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Perfect. The sandwiches may be a little pricy compared to other normal sandwiches. But for the portions given, it's worth it. I ate about half of the sandwich and I was about full. It also comes with chips of your choice and a caramel lollipop! That's what I call a done deal. I can't wait for it to open in LA. My body is so ready for you to come to SoCal, Ike's.
Reading some of the reviews, we were expecting a massive line at 1130 on a Sunday morning as we were walking through the Castro. But we figured we might as well drop by to see how crazy it was. Turns out, Kitchen Story next door was packed, but Ike's was basically empty. It only took us two minutes to order, and we were in and out in under ten. Got the Menage a Trois, which has chicken breast and BBQ sauce, among other things. The chicken was pulled or shredded instead of full slabs of meat, which was a pleasant surprise, and the dutch crunch roll was the perfect balance of crunchy and soft. Overall, the flavors worked well, and it was a very good sandwich. I'd declare a tie between here and Rhea's.
There's not much to say about Ike's... My sandwich was great! They also have somehow found a way to make gluten-free bread taste good. Good job, Ike!I'll definitely be back when I'm in San Fran again.
Finally tried this place after my boyfriend mentioned it way too many times. It is inexpensive, with great combinations. Their names are a lil promiscuous like Mnage-a-trois but still delicious nonetheless. Mnage-a-trois: halal chicken, real honey, honey mustard, bbq sauce, pepper jack, swiss, cheddarHere for the great food combo, not the names of the food lol. Definitely had my mouth watering when reading what was in the sandiwches.All sandwiches contained dirty secret sauce, your choice of lettuce, tomato.Free upon requests: red onions, pickles, banana peppers, jalapenos, & mustardother topping costs more. look at pictures to look at them costs.
One word: Amazing. I was here while visiting with my best friend and hubby and thought we would give this place a try after my co worker recommended we should. I'm so glad I did, probably the best sandwich I've ever had in my entire life.I wish they branched out more and bring it to SOCAL. We NEED this.Sandwich was pretty big and juicy. I ordered #111 mnage a trois I believe? It was bomb! It wasn't too busy when we came but they didn't have a place to sit and eat so my friends and I just ate it in the car..the only downside. But the food was so good I didn't let it bother me too much. Would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting NorCal.
Ikes is as good as it gets! I always get the MILF! The chips and dreams they offer are all great as well. Don't forget to check out their secret menu! Don't expect to eat there because is a really small shop, just walk a few blocks down to Delores park and after you're done with you're Ikes go to Bi-Rite and get a scoop of ice-cream. At least thats what I always do.
Ordered the hella sandwich and a #22. Excellent bread (sf sourdough), toppings were on point. Took about 15 minutes to make with the long line, but definitely worth the wait!
Dear Ike,Thank you for answeing my prayers. Even though it took over 5 years. We visited the Westwood location today. YUMMYThanks Ms P
I'm so sad. So sad.When my friends recommended this place to me, they didn't mention the dutch crunch!!! (but there is also my fault for not researching it on yelp... i guess i assumed the dutch crunch was a type of sandwich and not a bread)ANYWAYS...The wait wasn't too bad. after about 25 minutes waiting in line, i was able to get my sandwich. The cashier was very nice and helpful. I got the menage a trois with all the veggies you can put on it. But i got it on sour dough bread... BUT IT WAS STILL DELICIOUS!Really great sandwich. the sauces keeps the insides from being too dry but also gives it really good flavor. The halal chicken was great too! very tender and well seasoned.I recommend getting the voodoo chips on the side. They are a little too salty/vinegary on its own, but with the slightly sweet and savory flavor of the sandwich, it's perfect!explosions of flavor.I also recommend that you take your sandwich up to corona heights park nearby. you can eat your delicious sandwich while enjoying and AMAZING view. However, the sandwich obviously won't be as "fresh" as right when you get it. So it's up to you. Next time I visit, I shall try it on the dutch crunch and eat it right away... perhaps i'll give it a 5.5 stars.
We visited in September of 2013. I am still thinking about that sandwich.This place is super busy and we had to eat in the street- not sure if that has changed. I would probably eat in the street weekly for this place if I lived locally though. I ordered the "Name of the Girl I'm Dating" but just about every sandwich on their menu looks fantastic. Super fresh ingredients, so good. There is something for everyone here, and the ability to select your own chips is nice. Doing it again I would probably place a to go order in advance.
I love this place the Spiffy Tiffy is the best. The wait is a little long sometimes but its definitely worth the wait. You cant go wrong here best sandwich place around no joke.
Their sandwiches are delicious! I had a tuna melt - best I've ever had. Daughter had hot ham and cheese and she devoured it. Would definitely return..Service is good..Keep it up
Gross. I had the Barry Bond delivered today. I could not believe people give you the ratings that they do. Question: Why must you slather your sandwiches with so much damn sauce?!?! The bread was so soggy I had to throw it out. Why? Why? Why? Why? Holy Christ do you know what it feels like to unwrap the sandwich and feel soggy bread all over your fingers? Try it, you wasteful idiots!Unbelievable. What is that? Is it because you see it in movies you feel that's how you're supposed to do it? Just slop that sauce onto the bread like that? Did you see that in some movie taking place in Brooklyn or whatever and saw the deli chef just drop dollops of sauce onto the bread and you went "ey! I can do that!"The bread was soaking in the sauce! Absolutely disgusting!Never again!!
Stop reading this and go....NOWThis was my 5th time eating here and today God himself, IKE, handed me my sandwiches. That Mnage A Trois and Lincecum never tasted so geewwwd!!
They take their time, if you are in a hurry do not plan on eating here. PRO TIP: call in your order  as you can't really eat in there.
The sandwiches here are amazing! Gotta try for yourself. Very busy. Sandwiches are pretty big. My boyfriend and I shared one and it was very filling. Found this place on one of the food channels. Will be back for sure!
Best sandwich ever! My friend recommended I check this place out when I visit SF and I had no expectations, but I would have to say this is one of the best things I ate in SF. I got the Menage a trois on dutch crunch bread. It was AMAZING. The halal chicken was very savory and the bread was on point and fresh. The sauce was very good. It has the perfect amount of sweetness. You get lots of meat. When we got here there was only like 3 people ahead of us. After we ordered, the line was outside the door! Crazy! We got here around 6PM. If you get stuck in that line, it is definitely worth it. The sandwich also comes with a bag of chips. They charge you I think 25 cents for a brown bag. There are no tables to eat so we walked over to Dolores Park and ate there. We will be back!
We made our way here when we visited San Fran and was not disappointed in our choices. The menu seemed bigger online and I'm wondering if it's by location. It's much smaller than I thought and I wish there were seats to eat at, but the sandwiches made it all worth it.
We made this stop because of Man vs Food when we were visiting from the East Coast. It was sooooo delicious! I am sad that I won't be able to have more until we visit again someday! The Spiffy Tiffy was fantastic and we were shocked that there was no wait!!
This place rocks, literally rocks. The sandwiches are huge and pack a lot of punch! My boyfriend and I were unsure on what to order so we asked what was most popular and both got the mnage a trois. It's extremely flavorful and I highly recommend it! We were also there between 3-6 (not sure if it's everyday, or just weekdays, we were there on a Monday) and we got free chips and a drink with the sandwich as part of the "happy hour" they offer. Great spot to grab some lunch and head out to the park!
This is the best sandwich shop, so amazing, I am for sure come back.
***My 300th review*** goes to....... the best freakin' sandwich place... ever!So many to choose from; such a great variety! I love how they can make so much out of simple ingredients.  What they have on their board isn't even all of their sandwiches and the rest can be viewed on their online menu. Luckily when we went, there was no line. Since they have their menu online I would definitely recommend calling in your order ahead of time. If I lived in SF I would go down their list and try a different sandwich each time. Seriously.
I don't understand the hype. Thousands of people seem to have had better experiences here though so take this with a grain of salt and perhaps a drop of the famous "dirty sauce."For the sandwich size, the prices (~$10 - ~$12) aren't bad. The sandwiches are made with fresh bread and quality ingredients. It is much better than any sort of pre-packaged option but it's not a religious experience. Seating is very limited so hope it's a nice day where taking it to nearby Dolores Park is an option if not the primary point of the outing.Service is comically rude even when the line is near non-existent. Maybe there's an implicit dress code and they're only nice to you if you look sufficiently young and hipster or it's just supposed to be part of the charm? I'm too old for this.Ike's isn't bad. It's OK. I'd probably be kinder in the absence of the reputation and if it wasn't located near a myriad of taquerias on Mission which are better options but since those exist I'd say come to Ike's and deal with the downsides of popularity only if you're hellbent on a sandwich.
HEAVEN IN A SANDWICHAnd when I say "heaven", I mean when you eat Ike's you will find yourself wondering how one food could taste so damn good. If you are to follow one food hype/rave FOLLOW THIS ONE. You will not regret it. I don't know what took me so long to get myself to try Ike's, but when I took my first bite, I almost cried. I am a huge foodie, and this is probably as good as it gets. I had the Lincecum though, so some other sandwiches might not be the same. It gave me so much feels. All the flavors blended in so well. Let me just say, these sandwich makers have got talent. Side note: when a place has so many 5-star reviews yet people still scurry to give it more 5-star raves despite the fact that it probably won't make a difference in the rating, you know it's that good.This is one of those places that if a friend of mine were merely visiting California, I would tell them to drive up to Ike's to try their sandwiches. If a friend of mine were visiting from elsewhere, I would take them here first. Yeup. It's that good.
My original experience of Ike's is the Oakland location which typically involves some freewheeling employees, cool decor, and the best vegetarian sandwiches around. A great place.I work in the city so sometimes I make it out to this location and my impression isn't the same. It has all the features of a place burdened by the new tech wave. Dozens of awkward young people standing wall to wall looking at their phones while the only people who ever seem to pick up a sandwich are the minimum wage app delivery people who pick up tons of sandwiches off the assembly line so more tech workers in an office somewhere can enjoy their free lunch. I planned this lunch all week since I thought I'd be nearby. I came, I waited, I left. Got in my car and the order was messed up. I thought about giving up going here, but I walked back and they totally helped me out and helped me out fast (I think it was Ike who helped me). So it restored my faith in this establishment at least, even thought it is still way too busy. I appreciated the attention they gave to me even though they were epically busy.
So so bomb! Came here for the first time today. Thank god for yelp because their full menu wasnt on the wall. I already decided ahead of time that I wanted to get the Tom Brady which comes with their special sauce, vegan breaded chicken, cheese, mushrooms, avocado, lettuce and tomatoes . I actually asked for no tomatoes and they put it in my sandwich anyways. But it was so flavorful I didn't care. It was love at first Bite. That Dutch crunch soaking up all the saucy goodness and the meatiness from the chicken was just unbeatable. I'll definitely be coming be coming back for more!
A lot of sandwiches with cool names. My girlfriend and I had the krytonite. That sandwich lived up to its name and brought me to my knees. Never have I had a sandwich that big. Only ate half of it and it took me two sittings to finish it. Will try another sandwich next time. Their happy hour special rocks too!
Great sandwiches with lots of original options to choose from and the Dutch crunch bread was great as well. Sandwiches take a while to come out after you order so consider ordering in advance.
I wish this place was open for dinner. Sooooo many veggie options. It's delicious.
I would say this is my second favorite sandwich shop after Little Lucca's in San Bruno. But I do love that there is a gluten free option and it is actually quite delicious. If you are a native San Franciscan I expect that you have been to this place at least once. There are quite a few locations now throughout the bay area and I would definitely say that it is still worth trying. My only suggestion is...toasting the bread. Sometimes I can't finish this whole sandwich by myself so I save it for a little later but what I have noticed is that the bread gets soggy within five minutes so you're on a timeline when you order this sandwich. Either you split it with someone or shove it in your face immediately.
Great sandwiches as usual... The line on the other hand...was terrible. We waited about an hour long around 5pm on a Saturday and finally got our sandwiches in our hands by 6pm. I couldn't figure out why the order line took so long... The line wasn't long in quantity but it never seemed to move. We did realize IN line that they have an online ordering system but I suggest you should request it at least an hour+ in advanced as they have pick up time slots you have to select. For us, it was too late. I'm not sure it's ever worth 1 hour to wait for sandwiches so that's why I drop to 3 stars, but the quality of the sandwich was great. Always go for the Dutch roll. Yum!
Ike's place is by far my favorite sandwich place. My favorite is the Matt Cain. I have a gluten allergy and it is great that they have gluten free bread. Their gluten free bread actually tastes great unlike most gluten free bread. Some of other favorites include the mnage a trois and the doomsday. We order from here at least twice a month.
Honestly, it was too overhyped for me after hearing everyone rave about it for so many years. I give it a solid 4 stars. Delicious, hearty, satisfying sandwiches! But not so amazing that it blew my mind. I still like Mendocino Farms in LA better. :)My husband and I shared the Menage a Trois (one of their most popular sandwiches which has BBQ, cheddar, halal chicken, honey mustard, pepperjack, real honey, and swiss cheese) and their Going Home for Thanksgiving (turkey, cranberry, havarti, sriracha). I absolutely loveee turkey/cranberry combination sandwiches and this one even had sriracha in it (my fave!) so I HAD to try it. It was deliciousss and I actually liked it better than the Menage a Trois which was also tasty but a little too messy and heavy for my personal liking. I love how the sandwiches all come with their "dirty sauce." I think it's some type of garlic aioli. Whatever it is, mmmm! So good! However, I was so disappointed because they had run out of their Dutch Crunch bread for the day, so I got our sandwiches on their regular french bread which wasn't really anything special.I love how their sandwiches come with chips AND a lollipop. So cute! We got caramel apple pops. As for chips, I recommend the voodoo chips or the voodoo heat which is a little spicier! So good! They also have a lot of unique sodas in glass bottles. I tried Ike's Chocolate Cola and it was.... interesting, but not something I'd try again. We called our order in an hour ahead of time and I'm SO glad we did because there was a HUGE line out the door when we got there. I definitely recommend calling in to order if you can!There's not much seating at Ike's, so you can take your sandwiches to Dolores Park (nearby, walking distance) and enjoy them there.
Soooo yummy! Very good quality sandwiches and I especially like their version of vegan chicken; if you are a vegetarian and normally have purpose to grimace at the pallid tofu options available at sandwich places, you will be nicely surprised! Very hearty. I had some kind of artichoke heart and vegan chicken sandwich and it was mouthwateringly lovely :P
I love this place. It's kind of out of the way for me since I don't live in the city and parking can be a nightmare.But after going tanning at Tan Bella around the corner, I always make a stop here.I love pesto and always get the Spiffy Tiffy. Dutch crunch bread is always a MUST. I'ved tried a few of the other sandwiches and they are all really good! Big portions, comes with a bag of chips and a lollipop. Can't go wrong. This place is perfection.I'm so excited they are opening a new location closer to me in San Mateo!
Ike's place has redefined the term 'sandwich' in my eyes. I'm used to the boring combinations of deli meats, veggies, mayo, and mustard all shoved into a small slice of bread. Ike's place has gone above and beyond by creating hundreds of new sandwiches that have yet to disappoint- in taste or size. My favorite is the spiffy tiffy- but trust me, they are all delicious. Luckily, each sandwich comes with a bag of chips (try the voodoo flavor if you want a bit of spice). I recommend you call in your order prior to arrival, because a large line out the door and around the corner is highly likely. But trust me, it's worth the wait.
I'd heard all the hype, and man, did Ike's deliver. I had the Damon Bruce on Dutch Crunch, and would highly highly recommend it. The menu is crazy long and apparently changes often, so I'm looking forward to coming back and trying new things to find my favorites.Grab a sandwich and head on over to Dolores Park for an awesome lunch break. It can get pretty busy at Ike's during lunch hours, but in my opinion the wait is well worth it.
How hard is it to get a sandwich? Apparently very at Ike's Place. After being placed on hold for 7 minutes they hung up on me and now the line is busy so I can't get through. The pricey (but usually tasty, sometimes cold and soggy) sandwiches and the sh*t show to get the sandwich result in an overall unpleasant experience. Pass.
Yes, the sandwiches are great with a good variety of meat and veggie. The bread is fresh and consistently good. I recently had a chance to check out the new location in San Mateo which has already gotten popular so the lunch lines are getting longer.Thanks Ike for coming to San Mateo!
Didn't know we can order for pick-up so between waiting in line to order and getting our food, it took us 1 hour. It was all worth it. I eat a lot and half a Damon Bruce plus fries was enough. Have to agree with the reviews, must try!
The sandwich gods smiled upon me as I arrived at Ike's one recent Sunday at around 11:30am--the line was about 5 minutes long.I happily ordered a Nacho Boy (avocado, mushrooms, roast beef, and Swiss, plus I added lettuce and tomato) and selected BBQ-flavored chips to go with it. The guy behind the register was pretty chipper, though when I asked if they took AmEx, he looked at me like I had two heads (they do, by the way). The kids that work there seem pretty baked, but hey, they can sure make a good sandwich.When I left Ike's with my brown bag in hand, the line snaked around the block. I got jealous glares on my way out and basked in the glory of knowing lunchtime was upon me. I ate every last bite of the huge, sloppy, delicious sandwich on a nearby park bench.If I'm ready for lunch early enough next time I'm in town, I'll definitely consider Ike's again. But not if I have to wait in line for more than 15 minutes.
This place is an easy review...best sandwiches in the world! I gauge all sandwich experience's to the level that Ike's brings. When visiting San Francisco this is the first place I stop and actually is one of the main reasons I visit. Great vegetarian and vegan options. Always friendly. The menu is a bit exstenive, so if you're overwhelmed just go with the Pee Wee. Also, they deliver...So if on tour...They will deliver to the venue you're playing!
This place has lived up to the hype. They have around 500 sandwich so I can't say that everything here is amazing, but the every sandwich comes with their amazing bread and sauce. My brother got the Mario which was great and I got the 3 way. I would recommend taking some time deciding and taking plenty of recommendations to choose the right one. Make sure you order online and pick a good time slot, the line was pretty crazy out the shop
Yum yum yum. The best sandwiches around, their dirty sauce is to die for. I'm in love with the Jim Rome. Their dutch crunch is amazing. Their red pesto is amazing. Just go (and don't forget to call your order in or use their app so you don't have to wait!)
Screw this place. Not worth the wait. 20 min in mine and then he tells me 40 min wait. Bro, i woulda called it in. Don't believe the hype.
I've lived in SF for going on three years without making it to Ike's, figuring that "eh, it's a deli-style sandwich, how good can it possibly be?" Really f*ing good. I don't know what it is about the sandwich, but it's just really tasty.Pro-tip #1: I always order online through their facebook ordering system, since that's way less time-consuming than standing at the counter going "uhhhhh...." for minutes on end. My usual go-to is the Sanchez on dutch crunch, no tomato, add honey mustard (and I don't even like mustard). It basically ends up being a dumbed-down version of the Menage a Trois, which I like, but has too much stuff on it for my taste.Pro-tip #2: don't put the mozzarella sticks or onion rings or anything that's supposed to be crispy on your sandwich. Unless you like soggy mozz sticks. Also, make sure to check out some of the old-school sodas they've got on offer.
Consistently slow service. The music in there reverberates around the concrete room making it so you can barely hear people speak, which makes ordering awkward. Showed up around 1:15 and waited 35 minutes for a sandwich. I'd say only about 5 sandwiches came out during that time. One of the workers was carrying out 3 sandwiches to give to customers and dropped one on the ground, then picked it up wrong so it went ALL over the ground. She also walked like she was paid to walk extra slow. This place could be so awesome, but it's not.
This place did not disappoint - I had the sandwich with french name (cant remember) with dutch crunch. They actually had a lot choices and I wanted to try more but only had one stomach. Lots of meat and honey mustardy sauce was slightly sweet. It was bit pricy (~$10) but considering solid meat quantity, was ok. The bread was hard and crucnhy and tasted like real bun unlike subway air bun. Lots of calaory for sure but great quality subway.
Ok Ike. You sold me. I'm obsessed.At first, everyone kept telling me that you MUST have Ike's when you're in SF. I thought to myself, they're just sandwiches. How good can they really be?Turns out, they're good. Really good. Ok ridiculously awesomely good!We ended up in the Castro and quickly got turned off by seeing the line spewing out the door. Reluctantly, the bf and decided to just wait it out and just try the damn place!! The line goes down pretty quickly but we still waited almost a freaking hour to order and get our food.Since we actually waited, we decided to go for gold and get the Doomsday and Kryptonite. Since Im rarely here, might as well go for broke. The sandwiches ended up costing $19.99 each totaling up to $40 for lunch. At first, I thought it was pretty pricey until I heard my name be called and they handed me my bag of sandwiches.Turns out, one sandwich of a Doomsday and Kryptonite equals 4 regular ones!! I thought they got my order wrong at first but then I noticed that one sandwich equals two whole sandwiches!!! Our mistake was order both because we could have easily been full off of one.When we tore open the wrapper, wow those flavors combined was out of this world!! I didnt think the hodge podge of all sorts of ingredients were actually going to taste so good! It looks overwhelming, but it's sooo good!!I still have "half" a sandwich left. Can't wait to eat it once I'm full. Those sandwiches are to die for.The only downside I have to say about this place is that they don't have any seating. We had to eat at the park. It would have been nice if we could just eat then and there. How can people wait to eat sandwiches somewhere else?!Word of advice: order in by PHONE or ONLINE!! You'll save so much more time!!
These sandwiches are so good, I don't mind waiting 30+ mins to get a sandwich. My favorite sandwich is the Bella but all sandwiches are good! Dutch Crunch bread is a must! If you're in SF for a day, this is where you get lunch
Writing this review just reminded me that I left half of my Ike's sandwich from 3 days ago in my friend's fridge and now I am sad that I didn't get a chance to finish it because it was freaking delish. The dutch crunch bread is fantastic. I ended up getting the spiffy tiffy sandwich, but will definitely be back soe day to try the Menage a Trois. Really friendly staff, parking wasn't hard to find, sandwich can get messy but they give you lots of napkins. Yums.
I finally came to the original Ike's and I was surprised to find that it was a pretty small location. I am confused with all the Ike's places and lairs but in the end, it is the same chain and the same sandwiches. I came here on a Sunday around 1pm and the line was not bad at all. Score for that!I already had the Menage a Trois so I wanted to try the Matt Cain with godfather sauce, provolone, roast beef, salami, turkey. The sandwich was alright but the dutch crunch bread made it even more delicious. I had it to go and the sauce was dripping and making the bread soggy. I would eat it asap if I were you. That day there was a baseball game and Matt Cain was pitching, so I got a free drink for ordering that sandwich! This location gives you the classic caramel apple lollipop AND a bag of chips. The Cupertino location only gave me a pop so that was nice. I much rather get the Menage a Trois than Matt Cain.**TIPS**1) Check and see who is pitching if there is a Giants game. If you order the sandwich of the dude pitching, you get a free drink!2) Enjoy!
I think sandwiches are the world's plainest food but Ike's changed everything for me. Great location, quality ingredients, reasonable prices.I got the "Vegan Tom Brady" and was blown away. The sandwich is delicious and enormous that it served as both my lunch and dinner. Tangy, "meaty", savory, sweet. Oh man. Go try one for yourself and you will be converted.When you order for pick-up they throw lollipops in your bag and even the sassy hipster worker who asked me "not to sue him if the lollipop wasn't vegan" didn't bother me enough to remove a star, the sandwich was THAT good :)
ikes is still one of my fav sandwich places. pay a premium for a sandwich but its worth it. always leave so full and satisfied. i love the names of their sandwiches too. mmm that dirty sauce all over your mouth. cant help it. before i would share a sandwich but now i just gotta eat it all because its so good. or we buy two diff ones so we can swap and try different ones every time. now that ikes is everywhere, the lines arent as bad. good to call in before and pick up. it goes by faster. its about 12 bucks a sandwich. way more than the 5 dollar foot longs. but quality of life goes so far. delicious lunch!
I love my Ike sandwich. I've had it many times. A long piece of hair inside my sandwich and it melted along with cheese(I ordered Changes). This NEVER happened before. Mr Ike, please tell whoever who has brunette hair working in the kitchen to wear the hair net. I do not want to experience this. I was already having a bad day and this made it worst. By the way, we picked up the sandwiches on Saturday the 10th of May. Lunch shift. Agh.
Crazy how Ike's business has grown so much since having my first ever Ike's sandwich in 2008 when it was located in a little crowded house-looking venue (also remembering it was around an hour or 2 wait time (still waited though ;]).. Not to mention the bag of chips which were included with the sandwich purchase but not anymore, what a bummer). Anyways now in 2015, my go-to's are still Spiffy Tiffy and the Menage A Trios (on Dutch Crunch bread) but recently just tried We're Just Friends. An Ike's sandwich never fails! The wait was only about 15-20 minutes this time around (on a sunny Saturday late afternoon), which was awesome because I was starving at 3pm. I'm pretty sure I just inhaled the first half of the sandwich, which is the standard way of me eating my food. Pretty great that it can be 2 servings as well because I ate the other half in like an hour.. late lunch & early dinner? :PThough a little pricey for sandwiches, it's worth to have one once in a while. In my opinion, I think this original Ike's location is probably the best at making their sandwiches. Other locations like San Jose and Daly City, for some reason, just don't compare to Castro's "OG" location.. But it's okay. So with that being said, grab an Ike's sandwich and enjoy!:-)
Finally made my way back to Ike's, nearly 4 years later. They'd moved locations (and actually opened one in my hometown) and the wait is much more manageable now, maybe 10-15 mins during peak lunchtime. There's space to line up and wait inside.Overwhelmed with the menu, I finally settled on the pastrami and boy, was it good. Half was good for lunch, the other half made for a good work lunch another day. Sandwich also comes with a bag of chips (more choices!) and a caramel apple lollipop of my childhood. Basically a complete meal. PS can't go wrong with Dutch crunch.
Food was amazing ! Little sad that they don't have tables or seating there but it's a sandwich so it can be eatin on the go very good lunch spot
Worst customer service ever. There's always 10 people in the back, the one or two up front are always laughing amongst themselves and there's always a huge line of people waiting with orders piling up on the shelf. Always 20 mins plus for an online pickup order after you arrive. The sandwiches are great
After my first bit. Felt like sandwich heaven. Had a frankenstein of a sandwich, KYRPTONITE is a mans sandwich. 4lbs of food almost 2 foot sandwich. Must go again can't wait.
One of the best sandwich places I've ever been to. Take out only. So many sandwiches to choose from it's ridiculous. Will return again and again just to try something new.
Like Joey from Friends, I love me some sandwiches...and Ike's Place might be the greatest sandwich shop I've ever been to.Have you SEEN the menu? The menu is so big that half of it is secret, or you can just make up your own sandwich with the massive plethora of ingredients they have. All this for a really affordable price for a massive sandwich. I got the Menage-a-trois and added onion rings and avocado.It was goddamn delicious.Man I want to come back....so bad
My experience was good but not great. I came here on a beautiful Fall Sunday afternoon to grab a sandwich and walk over to the park. First time here and I had heard the hype but tried to temper my expectations. I forgot the name of my sandwich but it was essentially turkey and avocado. Overall, it was good but not great. The bread was probably the biggest disappointment, though the sandwich itself was a little bland. I ordered the dutch crunch roll and it seem like it was a day or two old - it certainly wasn't fresh. The turkey and avo were plentiful but for the price, I wouldn't have expected less. I know Ike's is famous for their secret sauce, but I could barely taste it. Overall, I hate to be a downer, but given the wait in line to order and then the corresponding wait for my food post-order I was disappointed. I'm tempted to give Ike's 3 stars but I have a feeling that I'll be back soon and the next sandwich will be better (I was able to try a similar but different sandwich with honey and it was much more flavorful - though the bread was still stale.)
Ermagerd this place is literally heaven!!!! It took such a long time to get here from North Beach where I was staying but it was so worth it. Super easy to miss!!! My BF was dying to try it and wanted the kryptonite, so we went and ordered one (no poppers or dirty sauce, I'm picky) and oh my goodness it was so good.... Go look up this sandwich. The pesto alone was amazing. The mozzarella sticks and onion rings on it just added to the amazingness. One sandwich (at $30) kept us full from like 3 pm until 8 pm. Do yourself a favor and go to Ike's and get a kryptonite ASAP!!! They have a location in LA too!!

The line is worth the wait. Very, very good sandwiches. I thought the mnage a trois was just too sweet for my preference and I'm surprised it's their top seller but it's good if you like sweet sandwiches. I liked the tilly. You can't go wrong with anything you choose. Super big and super tasty! Don't wait too long to eat it or it the Dutch Crunch will get soggy!
I've been eating at Ike's for a few years now, but my last few visits have been negative experiences. We place our orders online for weekend lunchtime pickup because we know the queues are crazy. We usually place orders about 1.5 hours in advance, but now when we turn up to get them, we're told to wait for another 15 minutes.Why bother giving us a pickup time if it's always going to be 15 minutes late? Just tell us to order for 15 minutes earlier or something.The sandwiches are still decent, but with the service the way it is these days I'd rather just go to Deli Board.
VEGAN review: WHAT IS THIS PLACE?! Damn good sandwiches. Line wait was like half an hour but it was delightfully worth it - I got the vegan Meatless Mike and traded half of it to my friend for their vegan Pilgrim Completely different sandwiches with their own merit. Meatless Mike has nice meatballs that taste like the real thing - moist and filling, while the Pilgrim was creamy and light (but just as filling), and probably way more flavorful than the Meatless Mike. Give them all a try. I'm totally coming back!
The sandwiches are full of flavor and are combinations that I would never think of by myself! They're also huge - 1/2 of one was enough for me! The only downside is that they are quite pricey - I paid over $13 for a sub.
Ummm didnt get 5 stars because the seating is kinda weird, BUT (notice the caps lock) OMFG. Let's start with the basics: STAFF was super super nice, now "let's talk about food ba by" Jesus christ almoghty lord...... Sandwiches were foodgasmic. Gooey cheese, flavorful meats, just great. Order your sandwich with the DUTCH CRUNCH bread. Tried the Matt Cain, changes the salami for the halal chicken. It was AWESOME. Great pre hangout food. See it, try it, enjoy- G
Absolutely delicious! I've introduced all of my friends to this place and everyone has loved it! I can't recommend just one sandwich because all of the sandwiches I've had so far were unbelievable!Awesome customer service and creative menu, two thumbs up for sure!
WOW WOW WOW!!If you are vegetarian/ vegan you must go there!They have all vegan food!!The food is unbelievably amazing and soooo good!Even if you are not vegan/vegetarian you should check this place out!!!
BOMB sandwiches. I got the nacho boy on dutch crunch with extra dirty sauce and it was amazing! It is a little messy though as you eat so be prepared with lots of napkins because sauce will be dripping!! Friendly service and you get a bag of chips and lollipop with your sandwich.We came early so the line wasn't that long although it was pretty crowded inside. This is definitely more of a grab your sandwiches and go kind of place. A few hours later, we walked by again and the line was way longer going outside near the restaurant next door. I don't know if I'd actually wait that long for this sandwich even though it sure is tasty. Price is also a little hefty for a sandwich and a little bag of chips but it's okay I don't regret it. :)
We came here at 4 and there was still a short line. I think it took 45 mins standing in line to order and wait for our sandwich to come out. We got the Menage A Trois and I was a bit underwhelmed. The dutch crunch was crunchy and good but the sandwich overall just tasted very sweet. I couldn't really taste the dirty sauce. It was a good sandwich but I am not sure it was worth the wait.
Love the sandwiches here, was even recommended the mnage a trois today which was amazing. On the downside it took over 30 minutes from ordering until it was in my hands (while the team laughed and frolicked out the back) fortunately I'm on vacation, but still....
Ike's Place is one of the top sandwiches spot in the city. The sandwiches are packed with flavor! I love the Matt Cain (godfather sauce, provolone, roast beef, salami, turkey).
You MUST go here when in SF. It is unreal.I had the vegan "turkey" one on the dutch crunch bread, added avocado. Got to sneak bites from my friend's orders too....all were delicious. Messy, but delicious.The bread is crazy good. And you know how crucial of an element that bread is for a sandwich! The sandwiches are pretty big, but I devoured mine pretty quickly. I don't think I stopped for much air, I inhaled that thing. I love a good sandwich, and to-date Ike's is definitely one of the better ones I've had. I asked if they had fries, since I had seen photos posted...but sadly, the girl informed me that they stopped selling those a few years ago. But you will get a free bag of chips with every sandwich! They had these dill pickle flavored ones that I chose that were good! We got there at a good time, but the time we started eating our sandwiches, the line was pretty long. People popped in to pick up take-out orders, that's the trick that the locals must use to beat the crowds. Overall, I will be back to this place to get my sandwich fix every single time I am in SF from now on! Winner!
So good and lots of vegetarian options (because we all have a few of those friends). My suggestion is to take the sandwich and walk to Dolores park and enjoy it there! This place is definitely worth the wait and shows San Francesco's quirkiness in all of their sandwich names! Don't forget to order the Dutch crunch bread!
Variety of delicious sandwiches! Kryptonite is a must try and a very generous size! Long line ups.
I love sandwiches!!! After trying Ikes, I can finally say that I have found the best sandwich place. Its too bad they are located in SF, which is 1.5 hours too far. However, I know where I am going when I am in SF. My boyfriend and I ordered our sandwich to-go 2 weeks ago while we were in SF. I didn't think much of it, since I have yet to have the perfect sandwich. After my first bite, I wished I had ordered another one. The French roll was soft and they pack in so much meat for you!!! The avocado was great as well. It made the sandwich taste creamy and fresh. The sandwich actually tasted healthy. There wasn't grease dripping down or on your fingers. Too bad we only ordered one sandwich. We are definitely coming back the next we are in SF. Not only are the sandwiches delicious, but the place is also nicely decorated with painted art.
Great sandwiches! Delicious, fast service and a must try!
Ordered delivery through Postmates at 1:30 on a Monday, arrived at 2:30 in Rincon Hill. This time I tried the SF Giants sandwich just to go with the theme of HOLY CRAP THE GIANTS WON FOR THE 3RD TIME IN 5 YEARS. Sandwich was still lukewarm and oh so so delicious. Thank you again, Ike's, for remaining a staple in my San Francisco diet and thank you delivery man for bringing it to me in all of its saucy glory.
Definitely not one to bash businesses but omg this place has the worst customer service ever! And the only reason why this deserves the one star that I HAVE to give is because of their sandwhiches.I've ordered my sandwiches either through their app or on the phone --just to avoid long lines and the wait. And both times they've completely fucked it up.First time ordering on the ap, made specific notes on what wanted to be added/ what we didn't want. Couldn't get that right. You would think that having it written down for them to read they would.Second time ordering on the phone, I ordered 4 diff sandwhiches; harbocalpyse, jeries', spiffy tiffy and stupid eggplant. We got the harbocalpyse and jeries, but also ended up with TWO sometimes I'm a vegetarian sandwhiches!I mean if they were going to fuck up then atleast fuck up with TWO stupid eggplant sandwhiches. Not only did I have to pay 3-4 dollars more for the sandwhich, but I had to pay for a sandwhich I didn't order/ want!I've been trying to call back for the past 30 minutes to let them know but now one is picking up. And I know for damn sure they have caller ID and are not picking up on purpose because they know my number and know they fucked up. Ridiculous!
Yeah, they do it big here. They have those crazy San Francisco lines outside of Ike's, but for this place it is well deserved. There's nothing I hate more than waiting in line, but for this place the payoff is immense. At this point probably an SF staple. Protip: Lettuce and tomato. Don't be a fool.
Quick walk in & grab sandwich place. I have been to Ike's in Oakland but always wanted to try the original in SF (I think it's the original). It was just like the Oakland but a bit smaller and for some reason, just a little cooler. I ordered the Going Home For Thanksgiving sandwich. The mixture of sweet from the cranberries and hot from the sriracha sauce was perfect!! Let's say it was finger licking good. I made quit a mess from the sauce and sourdough bread crumbs. Didn't have time to take a picture cause I ate it all but take my word, it was AWESOME!! Happy Eating
This place never disappoints. I live in Orange county and I've been here twice and it is soooo good. I got the We're Just Friends sandwich with Dutch crunch. Definitely get the Dutch crunch. My boyfriend lives his cheese steak with rib eye. Try it out. It's on the expensive side for sandwiches but worth it.
Got the Tom Brady, worth every delicious vegetarian penny.Wish there was a menu I could look at in the store with just all the veggie options. The one I looked up online had me guessing if I made up the Daniel Glover.It's not a far walk from Dolores park, so a nice lunch date is in order :D
Literally one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. I recommend the Nacho Boy. The bread is perfect, the meat savory and tender, with shrooms and aioli. We also met a wonderful Australian couple who we spoke with for two hours. Surprising to create such great friendships in a place without tables. 5 stars!!!!
Pretty disappointed with my experience at Ike's today, Saturday, December 26, 2015. The wait for my order was an hour and 15 minutes for two sandwiches. I'm not sure what was happening with the shop today, but I had guests in town and that was so unacceptable. The sandwiches were good but not worth that wait. The cashier should have told folks what the wait time was prior to ordering - he told us after we had placed our order. Very disappointed.
Sandwich was great but quite a large price for it. The chip selection is unique and the bottle sodas are very interesting.
Holy Cow! If you want to know what heaven tastes like, sink your choppers into the mnage a trois or a spiffy tiffy. These are the two sammys we indulged in but I'd be willing to bet big bucks that everyone of their sandwiches prepared on their delicious Dutch crunch bread is as good as making a deal with the devil ( I'm talking grade A, slap ya momma good!) I'm a sucker for anything with mushrooms and pesto so naturally I ordered the spiffy tiffy which includes both along with povolone, pepper jack, avacado, and Halal chicken( now I've never heard of this but someone explained to me that it has to do with the way it's prepared- don't know if that's true?- but regardless this meat is moist and tasty!) The mnage was just beautiful! Bbq sauce, honey mustard,3 types of cheese, chicken and the kicker is the extra honey they drizzle in this bad boy-this will make you lick your lips for hours after you've devoured the sandwich in hopes to find a little remanence left on your face. It's good,real good! Plan a picnic at the park, pick up a sandwich from Ike's place today, I dare you not to eat half on your way over. It's just that good !
I am definitely a fan of the sandwiches! I have visited every time I am in the city and it's a tradition of ours. However, USUALLY the staff is right on. We ask for advice and they'll help us in a heartbeat but this last visit, that wasn't the case. The girl (young, blonde curly hair, just had been caught texting at the register) seemed irritated that I even dare ask what she suggested! I asked her what she thought was good to fill my sour / fresh craving, and she shrugged her shoulders and sighed loudly looking back at the sign like.. UGH.. so I said forget it and ordered what I wanted. Also, there were 2 people behind us, not like the usual 20 in line. So why she couldn't take one minute to help a customer out is beyond me. But if Ikes wants their reputation to withhold itself they should probably have her take a customer service class for sure. Luckily I am a yelper and I can figure out my own meal choice, however a suggestion would have been lovely. 5 Star - Food3 Star - Service
Definitely worth the wait!!! One of the best sandwiches i had in awhile. Now, im waiting to go back to San Francisco for some more.The brown bag and caramel apple lollipop really tops it off.
No other sandwich place holds a candle to Ike's, you guys. If you like big ass, flavorful sandwiches with fresh ingredients then you will definitely love any item from their broad menu. The reviews speak for itself. The only reason this place is shy of a perfect 5-star rating is because of the long lines and price. So call ahead and jump the line. The price point is pretty typical for an SF joint and well worth the occasional experience of enjoying the BEST SANDWICH EVER.
If anyone ever reads this review (#6401), just know that this place is super bomb! Kind of a bit of a wait, but it lives up to its hype. Grab a couple sammies, walk up the street and have a picnic at Dolores Park!
An SF landmark. Ike makes the best sandwiches in the city arguably the best I've ever had. Manage a Trois is my go to order on dutch crunch. What up Aleef? Go niners.
Wow! Talk about delicious!! I saw this place on Man vs Food a long time ago, and I've been wanting to try it since. Finally made my way there for a late lunch sandwich and I am in food heaven. I got the #1/2 Spiffy Tiffy, amazing! All the sandwiches have interesting names and not your ordinary fillings. If you are hungry for a sandwich and your in the area, this is it! I can't wait to come back and try something else.
Let's be real. I love Ike's and all but this last experience killed it all for me. I ordered Ike's through Postmates because my colleagues and I were craving and we're cross the city. We wait an hour and half for it - no big deal. There's always a wait for the sandwiches. Let's talk about the food. 5 sandwiches and they were all awful. Skimped on the meat. Breads dry. Not enough dirty sauce on it when we even requested extra dirty. I'll take my $15 elsewhere for another sandwich. Even with a skip the line pass, I'll have to wait 30 mins for a sandwich. No thanks.
Perhaps I didn't get the right one. I got the pastrami charmed life sandwich on Dutch Crunch and didn't edit anything to it so that I can see what Ike's is all about. It wasn't the best sandwich I've ever had to say the least. They don't do half orders and chips were not free with a sandwich. I got the sandwich, a bag of chips and a bottled strawberry lemonade for about $16. There's no place to eat inside so you'll have to take it somewhere else. It's a large sandwich but I like my pastrami hot/warm and this was more of a deli with no unique toppings. The bread had a nice crunch but I don't think it enhanced the sandwich at all. There was way too much sauce (from mayo, dirty sauce & coleslaw) that after half I was essentially done with it. It does get messy!
I've been waiting for over an hour for two sandwiches. When I asked if they would give me an ETA they said it would be longer now... Where the hell did service go?
First let me start off by saying this place is only getting more than one star because my boyfriend enjoyed his sandwich. This place is beyond overpriced for two sandwiches a drink and some jalapeo popper's was $31, not to mention it wasn't even that good. The jalapeo poppers where a hot whatsoever and had little to no taste. We were told that it would be a little bit longer of a wait for our sandwiches since the poppers take longer.... Except it took 20 minutes and it wasn't even that busy.The service was horrible the people are super unorganized my boyfriend went to go ask for napkins and the guy looked at him like he had no idea what he was talking about.. My boyfriend proceeded to find and get his own napkins. All in all this place sucked.
Mnage a Trois is a must. Mozzarella sticks were 6$ for 4 baby sized sticks. Not impressed. Have a good day.
Definitely Over rated. Got the mnage n we R just friends sandwiches. It Came out so saucy that the breads were all soaked. Tastes good but def not with the wet bread
The sandwiches are so worth the wait!!! The service is terrible though. They all have that "don't give an eff" attitude at the counter; however, my sandwich always comes out beautifully crafted!
What can you say about this place that thousands lready have not? To be critical, I would recommend that you visit any other than the the Sf location and you will not see the same long line. And they do have quite a few now.
The best sandwiches ever.  That's it. It's a must visit when you're in the city.The sandwiches are a little expensive, but I personally think you get your bang for your buck as the sandwiches are huge! The dutch crunch bread is to die for. Chips are one of a kind and great.The only downside is there is no seating to enjoy your food. There is just a line of chairs, while you wait for your food to come up. It's sweet to see the employees come out of the kitchen and call out your name, personally bringing you your bag of food. And every sandwich comes with a caramel apple lollypop. :)
Although the sandwiches served here are delicious, my overall customer service experience would have to be 2/5. This would be the third time calling the store for the passed 5 days for pick up since I work around the neighborhood. I was always put on hold for at least 15-20 minutes before receiver/cashier takes my order. I was then told that my order won't be ready for 20-25 minutes for pickup. I love their sandwiches here but the 40-45 minutes waiting time is ridiculous!!! Waiting time just takes too long and would rather go some where else who are more quick, efficient and just as good or even better. I would totally understand if this happens once in a while but 3 times within 5 days??!!! Unacceptable.
Had to wait almost 45 minutes for a sandwich and so did everyone else. The sandwiches were indeed tasty, though a bit heavy with that after effect. Not worth the wait though,my god, what a long wait for a sandwich and with me having to head back to work within a certain amount of time...
One Word: INCREDIBLE!Possibly the best sandwhich I've ever had!There are about a gazillion sandwhiches to choose from on the menu, the staff is super friendly, and it's just delicious! The line can be long but it's so worth the wait. I had the Bumgarner (?) sandwhich and it was amazing!
This was my first meal while visiting SF. We were starving and wondering the streets and I was so happy to stumble across it. The day we went in it was IKES BIRTHDAY - so we got free chips and a drink so it was all very serendipitous. We got the catros pride and everything tasted fresh and awesome. The staff was friendly and patient. Note: they recently quit accepting cards and only take cash.
Love their sandwiches! The best part is you can also customize any of the sandwiches with as many additional toppings as you want. The dirty sauce is slightly sweet, which I really like for my sandwich- but we warned if sweetness in sandwiches is not for you.I recently had the Ugly Owl with added pickles, and I loved it. The wasabi mayo was delicious and all of the flavors were just perfect- would definitely eat again! The only con was since I had my sandwich about an hour after I ordered and it was saucy, my sandwich got a bit soggy. The flavors were worth it though!
So many fantastic options! I ended up getting the sourdough for my let's be friends, but wish I got the Dutch crunch. I do love sourdough bread, so the sandwich was still amazing... but I feel like I should gotten the dutch crunch for the authentic experience. Delores Park is just a short walk away, so it is an excellent place to enjoy your sandwich!
Absolutely the best sandwiches ever, period! If you're visiting SF like me, those sandwiches will make you wanna feel like moving to SF! =)
Called in for a to go order, girl on phone asked if she could put me on hold for 2 minutes to handle the orders before me. I was left on hold for 11 minutes, during which time I had gotten in my car and driven to Ike's. I was just getting in line when a man picked up the phone and greeted me. I had heard him telling the girl not to leave people on hold indefinitely. Anyway, I waved and let him know I was in line now, so I would just order from the counter. Waited in line, got to counter and put in my order, where I was informed that they were out of Dutch Crunch bread. I told the girl that if she had not left me in hold for 11 minutes, she could have saved me a trip, and then I left. I was coming to this place twice a week. Anyone know a good sandwich place in the mission?
I love this place! They have the best sandwiches in the city. Its always best to call in advance so you don't have to stand in line and wait. My favorites are: hollywood cheesesteak and damon bruce. They also have a lot of veggie options.
They do have good sandwiches. However the price is kinda high; so four stars from me. It does come with a bag of chips. They do sell drinks there too. I do like my bread soggy so that is a plus for me. I've had the Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian which has grilled mushrooms, Marinated Artichoke Hearts, Pesto, Provolone. Also had the Stupid Eggplant Sandwich which has breaded eggplant, Marinara, Provolone cheese. I do want to try more sandwiches. I really liked the Stupid Eggplant Sandwich more. I got it cuz I felt sorry for the eggplant being called stupid even though I don't know the story behind it. I think this is one of those places where you just need to try it once, you never know, you may like it! And if not well, it's not the end of the world. :]
6000+ reviews 4.5 stars average rating makes me drink 40 miles to try their sandwiches. But I wish I didn't!I was actually excited to see the long line because it means the reviews weren't bs....problem it moves so fucking slow!Mnage a trios $11.99 - other than the Dutch crunch bread that the was pretty good other than that everything was just below average. all I tasted was the over sweeten bbq sauce over some tasteless chickenHollywood SF cheesesteaks 9.99 - beef is blah and mushroom were out and they replaced it with avocado didnt go well. Cashier knew they were out of mushroom but only told us after we placed the order, how nice.It's a to go place you order n eat out in the street For that price you expect more!Sandwich were just like subway with nicer bread.... Sorry yelpers you let me down on this one
My favorite place to grab a bite to eat when I'm in SF. The staff are super friendly, the sandwiches are HUGE, and its conveniently located near Dolores park to eat. They give caramel apple pops every order as well which is a plus!
definitely worth the line and the hype! creative and customizable sandwiches - they've got something everyone will like. whether you're gluten intolerant, vegan, or whatever else - they've got something for you. my favorites are the:spiffy tiffybellahot momma huda
Holy Mother of God! When you're the number one reviewed place on all of Yelp and have an average rating of 4.5 stars, you have to check it out. And now I'm telling you, you better. If not, I don't know what you're doing with your life.Top ten sandwich spots of all time. I don't think I can say which one is the best. There are too many amazing sandwiches I've consumed in my life, but Ike's is up there for sure.I heard so much about Ike's and couldn't wait. Though I had to, there's a line. However I hear it's much worse when compared to when I went. Waited for about ten to fifteen minutes at most. I got the Matt Cain (Godfather Sauce, Provolone, Roast Beef, Salami, Turkey) on the Dutch Crunch bread with Dirty Sauce. Took this bad boy over to Dolores Park and began my attack. My friend was admiring the park and looked back at me. They asked "Where did your sandwich go?" I explained I ate it. They wondered if I remembered to chew but I assured them, everything was chewed and consumed properly. I just may have done it extremely quick. Perfect balance of meats, cheese, bread and spread.Please, if you are ever in San Francisco. This is the number one place you have to go eat.I'm still thinking about that sandwich. It comes to me in my dreams and I begin to weep when I awake. Someone bring me one!
So dirty inside. So disorganized. Good sandwich but not worth the hassle!! I miss May's.....
Best. Sandwiches. Ever!I swear I would drive from SD or LA to SF for the sole purpose of eating these sandwiches. I didn't expect this place not to have any seating and luckily, I avoided the long lines by coming at odd hours (3:30 on a Wednesday). SCORE! I've had the Name of Girl I'm Dating (now called the Beauty) and the Barry B and both were phenomenal. I've also tried and liked my friend's Stephen Jenkins. Get the sandwiches on Their infamous Dutch Crunch bread because it'll make all the difference and don't forget the dirty sauce. Each sandwich order comes with a bag of chips and a caramel apple lollipop. Damn...I'm craving Ike's again.
Delicious sandwiches, great customer service! Ike is very friendly and takes pride in making sure every customer is satisfied and has everything they need. Thank you for a great experience!
Great sandwich, but don't come on Saturdays. Poor management. Cashier will take an order, switch roles to run back and forth in kitchen takes 5mins, then hops back on register, repeat. No wonder the line doesn't move!When you have a surge of customers, low staff at the register, they should be smarter than carry long conversations with customers.Total time from standing in line and getting a sandwich was over 1hr. Judge for yourself.
I love going to castro whenever I'm in SF, which I make an effort to visit at least once or twice a year. I always have to stop at Ike's Place for a mnage  trois on Dutch crunch bread. I've been pretty lucky each time with a short wait except for the last time I visited in spring 2014, which took about 20-30 minutes. Gosh, has it been that long? I'm due for a visit soon! There's a location in west LA, I think I'll definitely make a visit this weekend after writing this review! Grab a couple sandwiches, walk a few blocks southwest to tartine bakery for pastries (a bit of a wait as well) and have a picnic at Dolores park!
I have heard about Ike's for a long time. I lived in San Francisco for three years and never stopped by. Now I'm upset that I missed out. I came here a few weeks ago before a comedy show. My friend was goggling sandwich places and suggested Ike's Place. I convinced him that the line would be way too long and we'd never find parking. Of course, once those words left my mouth, we found a parking spot a block away from Ike's. And, we actually went at a time with no line or wait. It was meant to be. The food was delicious. They messed up my friend's order, but were quick to fix it without any issues. We drove over to Mission Dolores park and enjoyed some sunshine while reveling in our delicious, messy sandwiches. The produce was fresh and the sauce was ridiculously good. Make sure you get extra napkins!I would wait all day for a sandwich from Ike's. I'll definitely be back soon.
Awesome Veg options.. love the steve jobs!
Don't let the long wait deter you, Ike's is well worth it. The mnage a trois is amazing. You also can't go wrong with a Matt Cain. Get your sandwich on Dutch crunch bread and you're all set. Add freebies like jalapeos and pickles for some extra flavor (not that the sandwiches need it!). The chips and sodas are also damn tasty. A great overall meal - definitely come hungry! If you can, phone your order in for a shorter wait time.
This joint is the #1 yelped place in SF. While the sandwiches were tasty, I was expecting something mind-blowing awesome. Don't get me wrong, they were good, but I feel like I could've gotten an equivalent sandwich at a sit-down restaurant.Spiffy Tiffy - $10-Avocado, Halal Chicken, Mushroom, pepperjack, Pesto, Provolone - Was pretty tasty, 3.5/5. I think they put too much sauce on it tho.The Damon Bruce - $14-Beer battered onion rings, Provolone, steak sauce, rib-eye- Pretty good, 4/5. Again, I think they put too much sauce on it. It tasted more like a burger I could've gotten at a restaurant than a sandwich. Not worth the hefty $14 price tag.TIPS:-We showed up at 10AM and didn't have any wait. -The menu online has more stuff than the menu at the store-This is a "to-go" place. The inside doesn't have any dining or anywhere to sit.-All orders come w/ comp chips and a lollipop.
best damn sandwhichs in the city puts subway to shame
So while waiting to have lunch at kitchen story, I decided to try Ike's because the line was short and it was just right next door. i ordered the Menage A Trois. I came to realize that ike's sandwiches can fill you up for the whole day and you can divide one sandwich into two meals. overall the sandwich was delicious and the hype was real. Definitely need to try more on the menu and good thing the one in LA just opened up in westwood
I waited in line for an hour and it took another 20 minutes to get a sandwich. The sandwich was barely even warm when served, and a cold meatball sub is not really anything to write home about. The bread was very good, but the sandwich overall was nothing special and having it served to me cold after almost an hour and a half of waiting for it will not bring me back to Ike's in the future.
Hitting the City for work and came across this little sandwich shop! Definitely visit, but come hungry! Had the # 99 and all I can say is damn good!
Visited San Francisco for four days and my partner and I came here twice. I got the Barry B both times and he got the Dirty Ernie and mnage a trois. The place was busy both times, but i waited no longer than 10 minutes to place my order. On both visits we were greeted with friendly, patient, and helpful staff. Sandwich were large and warm. I saved half my sandwich for the next day and it still tasted fresh. The sandwiches are a little pricey, but they're also pretty big so I thought it was a good value. Overall above average sandwiches and great customer service.
Mnage a trois was what i ordered. I also had the voodoo chips. THAT WAS AWESOME. i thought the sandwich was really fresh. The honey drizzled with the chicken and avocado was definitely a really good and harmonious combo. I hope to come back again and have the sandwich. The line of the wait, on the other hand, is pretty disorganized. It would be nice if they could organize it a little better. Other than that, the food is great, service is great, and owner was awesome. Just make sure there's gonna be at least 30-45 minutes wait before getting to you during lunch hours.
Great subs! My boyfriend and I shared the Matt Cain and the Spiffy Tiffy, both on Dutch Crunch. They've got that overstuffed yet fresh feeling that you just don't get from sub shops of the Quizno's and Subway ilk. Fresh bread doesn't hurt either. There's limited seating in the store though I'm sure you could cop a seat if you were solo and in a rush. However, you're a five minute walk from Dolores Park so to me that's clearly the better option. Our ice cream sandwich still hadn't melted by the time we got over there and sat down on the lawn to eat. Props for carrying Coolhaus ice cream sandwiches by the way.Parking in the neighborhood is tough but there were several spots in front of the school on 16th, you just have to be careful to leave before 3 or be towed.5 stars for delicious subs in a great neighborhood walking distance from a chill spot to eat them - a San Francisco treat!
The superior lesbian is the best sandwich I have ever had in my life. It has vegan chickun, ranch, Tabasco sauce, and veggies. Plus they have amazing beverage options like Jolt cola: I didn't even know they still made that.
I'm by no means a traditional sandwich loving kind of gal. After eating pp&j's, bologna, and turkey since elementary school my appetite for the bread and meat combo has pretty much dwindled. So when I'm hungry a sandwich never crossed my mind and if that was all that was left, I would eat and not be satisfied. All hope seemed lost until... Ike came along.I was first brought here before the craze and hr long lines, 10-15min wait at the most. I first ordered [Name of the Girl I'm Dating] and it's been love at first bite :). I was skeptical at first because I thought it would be just another sandwich, but no... it was amazingness hugged by two delicious pieces of bread that gave my mouth such pleasure. The chicken meat is tender and the sauce brings the perfect blend of flavor and the french bread... mmm carbs. I love this place! I've also had the Elvis Keith which is good as well, but i still love "my girl." It's the best sort of messy (besides bbq) that no sandwich can compare. I'm just a little sad that the old shop closed and it's bittersweet that Ike's has blown up like it did... darn you MvF... darn you and your quest. Now I must call in an hr ahead for my food... I miss being able to be spontaneous and walk in when wandering around the neighborhood. Oh le sigh. But Ike's is still worth every second, every minute, every hr of wait and every savory bite. Nom.
If you don't like sandwiches, I am suspicious of your motives.If you don't like Ike's sandwiches, there is something wrong with you.
Workers there were super cool and the sandwiches were downright delicious. Please stop by this place if you're in the Castro area. You won't regret it!
3/5 stars. A place for bros who enjoy food. FUCK YEAH BRO MY REVIEW IS IN THE 6000s
This is my first time trying Ike's. I've only had the Elvis Keith but so far its pretty good. I wish I got chips with it because the wasabi mayo on the sandwich would make a great dip. Defiantly will try them again.
OK so just like everyone else I really loved the minage a trios when I first found this spot but if you like that sandwich let me introduce you to the sandwich which is hands down my favorite. The sandwich is called the Mark Appel it has Fried chicken, barbecue sauce, honey mustard, honey, pepper jack, cheddar, and Swiss. Those toppings alone make a delicious sandwich but since I really love bacon I decided to add bacon and i'm glad I did. I cannot describe to you how delicious this sandwich is all I can say is you have to go and try it. You will not be disappointed! The only downfall is that it is a little pricey the price was $19 with the chips.
Their sandwiches were some of the best I've had! I just wish all of their locations had the same menu. If it your first time yore limited to the ones listed them because there were a lot of sandwiches that weren't there but still offered.
I've deducted a star because not only have they raised the price by a big jump, they've also stopped giving out free chips with the sandwiches! Really? As if raising the prices wasn't enough? On the plus side, they'll throw in a free canned soda if you pay cash. I'm just a tad disappointed that's all, but the sandwiches will always be a must when I visit san francisco :D
I've finally made it to ike's and shockingly there was no line! I ordered the Barry B on dutch crunch, and holy smokes it was delicious! To make things even better it was "happy hour" so I got a free drink and chips! Friendly staff, humorous tip jar accepting phone numbers, and overall good sandwiches. GET YOU SOME!
Best sandwich shop EVER! I have tried a few sandwiches a d will be making many ventures back to try more!There's other locations now, too! Including Walnut Creek - right next to the movie theater.Do yourself a favor and order the Matt Cain!!!
I have a wonderful experience here in Ike's Place, I ordered Spiffy Tiffy Sandwich it was huge and couldn't resist the aroma. The texture was really catchy. I can see the glorious selections of filling. It was really a temptation, totally delicious.
The place is a straightforward no nonsense sandwich shop. It is designed as a pickup place because there isn't any tables to sit down and eat. Also, if you pay CASH, you can get a free drink per sandwich.One of the things that makes or breaks a great sandwich is the bread. And they pass with flying colors. The dutch crunch was crispy and chewy. If I'm in the neighborhood, I'm definitely going back.
Ikes has really gone down hill over the years. I used to come here with my family when I lived in SF, and I loved every bite of it back then. However, after going here for lunch, I am nothing but disappointed. The bread (dutch crunch) tasted old and was not crunchy at all. The no more free chips thing was all a disappointment, especially after our 3 sandwiches totaled over $50. (There should be a LOT more that two money signs up there, honestly.) Overall, I think that the quality has gone way way down compared to what it used to be. Ikes is no longer the best sandwich in SF. The shop is also a mess, staff are unprofessional and overworked. No seating and all the surfaces are covered in grime. Sorry, Ikes. Not coming back here anymore.
Food was great. Better than any other sandwich shop I have tried. The employee was very rude and chased us out of the shop to tell my cousin a sassy comment which was uncalled for.
I once paid $15 for ike's delivery. Aww yiss. I did it. Was so werf. I don't even know what to say. Ike's is awesome and delicious and I love the Matt Cain. Dutch crunch bread is the way to go and their sauceee. So good. I usually go to the one in SFSU and I've been to the original location several times. Lines, lines everywhere. It's not bad and it's not like it's not worth it, but I just hate lines. I try to go during the off/slow hours. Staff is friendly which is always a plus!
I got the Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian. It was so good and I didn't wait that long. The reason I'm giving this place 1 star is because I found TWO strands of hair in it. One was obviously a girl's hair and the other was a pube. Yes, a pube! One hair is already disgusting and shouldn't be happening, but two?! The employees in the kitchen need to wear hair nets or something. That's a big problem.
It's got to be my favourite sandwich place in San Francisco. These sandwiches are incredible and caters to everyone, be it vegans, vegetarians or meat eaters. The sandwiches are fresh and the portion size is just right. The dutch crunch is their signature, and is hands down the best in the city! The first time I went there i wanted to eat something vegetarian and ended up trying their "Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian" and since then have been hooked to it ever since. The waiting might be a bit of a pain, but it's completely worth it.
Such an overrated place. It attracts people who enjoy standing around in lines like flies.
Amazing sandwiches! I'm so happy that they serve halal chicken. This place is great for casual sandwiches to grab-and-go! Definitely worth trying
We got the Lincecum and it is the best sandwich ever. The Lincecum is much better than the Matt Cain and Al Davis. Avocado adds a creaminess to the sandwich and all the textures and flavors really work well.
Try the Menage A Trois on French bread. Saucy, meaty, and cheesy goodness.
Disappointing experience. I ordered a make-your-own sandwich today that was vegetarian. The woman who took my order asked me what kind of meat I wanted and I clearly said 'no meat, vegetarian sandwich please'. After taking my order she repeated my sandwich contents to me correctly. Then, the staff at Ike's just went ahead and made the sandwich they thought I should have, not the one I ordered. They put turkey in it which a complete waste of meat that I didn't ask for and they put avocado in my sandwich which I also did not ask for and a waste of more food. This is after I waited 20 minutes to order the sandwich and another 20 minutes for it to be ready. The sandwich tasted just okay and it was definitely not worth the overpriced $14 I paid for a sandwich I didn't order.Come on! All you do is make sandwiches, is it that hard to read the words on the order receipt? I won't be coming back to Ike's. Why when there are so many great sandwich places in SF -- Deli Board, Yellow Submarine, Molinari and Gambino's are all far superior to Ike's.
Another SF spot that serves up solid sandwiches....a real fine sandwich indeed. There is a decent amount of love that goes into these sangweeches.The line out the door is 50% hype and 50% demand......it's just what a business wants and it's just what customers want, mostly.Bottom-line, nobody wants to eat standing, in a car, or on a piss-stained curb....I get that I knew going into it that Ike was to cheap to throw some small tables inside and outside, I get it's just the way it is. But it doesn't have to be.....a little birdy told me that they are selling so many sangweeches that they are opening another location in San Jose, with tables, that's cool.The Dutch crunch is really good bread... And their meats where really well cooked and well played, solid build-out Ike, solid build out.All in all, a place with 5,000 plus reviews are stacked with 5 star review after 5 star review, which is fine.....if I were to rate the joint for sandwich alone, an easy 4 star, but it's quite pricey, yeah I get it; google employees eat these everyday and make 300K a year....just saying, it's a sandwich, a cola & and a bag of chips.All in all....decent meat between a solid selection of breads, and if you know me, you know I never follow the easy route, I'm a purist in every sense and I give credit where credit is do...it would have been easy to give the place 5 stars like every other skinny jeans that goes here....but I'm giving an honest review, because I'm an honest person.
call and order before you go! THE BEST tasty treats!
Had a Menage a Trois in SF! The sammie, that is. BBQ, cheddar, halal chicken, honey mustard, pepper jack, real honey, swiss.It was deliciously juicy and flavorful, and the chicken was quite tender!For some reason it didn't quite blow me away though. Perhaps it was because it was a little too wet and saucy, so the sandwich was a slightly soggy mess. Or perhaps I expected too much from all the hype. Nevertheless, it was still good!I also tried the pastrami and the spiffy tiffy (avocado, halal chicken, mushrooms, pepper jack, pesto, provolone). The pastrami was good, but the spiffy tiffy was dry and tasted a little dull in terms of flavor. We phoned in our order and picked it up so it was quick, but strangely, there was no line anyway! Each order comes with a lollipop and chips!
Sandwich was just above average for $13 and I've found a chicken bone in the sandwich.
Made my own sandwich and the price wasn't so bad :) it was the most delicious thing ever! I highly recommend this place if your looking for a large and great sandwhich!
This place is overrated and over-hyped. Long line and no comfortable tables and seatings besides some side wooden chairs. I do give credit to their creative names on their sandwiches. SANDWICHES WE ORDERED:Hollywood's SF Cheesesteak - rib eye, mushrooms, provoloneyelp.com/biz_photos/ikesMatt Cain - roast beef, turkey, salami, God Father sauce, provoloneyelp.com/biz_photos/ikesTheir Matt Cain stood out with the distinct sauce, but you can pass on Hollywood.Their sandwiches are good - not, oh my gosh, these are the best sandwiches I have ever eaten! It's simply mediocre. :XI do like the Dutch Crunch for one of their bread options. Pretty pricey for sandwiches that were alright. They have unique selections of chips to pick from, but it doesn't make it a wow moment for me with their sandwiches.Disappointed and unsatisfied with the dining and sandwich experience.Final say - I tried it and don't crave for more. Next!
My first meal after getting off SFO airport was Ike's. My friend took us here to try out their sandwich and my first impression was tiny, shady, expensive and weird. We got slightly lost looking for this place, and compared to NYC the street was pretty empty so i was just thinking what kind of shady place my friend is taking me. Once we found it, we notice a slightly small store with just a few seats for people waiting for their food. The menu had a bunch of weird named sandwich which ranged from $9-$20 (never had such expensive sandwich unless i'm at a diner). I ordered some sandwich that had wasabi in it thinking it would be interesting, my friend and sis ordered some weird name sandwich too. Hands down best sandwich i ever had. Expensive but worth every single penny, the sandwich is huge too. We were all full just eating half the sandwich. I think what makes their sandwich interesting were the combination of ingredients and sauce. They were weird and unlike any that i have taste but weirdly really really good.
Ordered the Damon Bruce...AMAZING. There's is a bit of wait but it's definitely worth it. The establishment itself is not that big and there's not many seats available, but there's a park close by where you can enjoy your super awesome sandwich. Warning:Your sandwich may attract dogs
Not surprised that there was a huge line for Ike's even when it's past lunch time. IT was my first time here and my friends who all moved up to the Bay were raving about this place. The employees are very nice. I told my cashier that I had never been, so he was helping me out (quickly but efficiently as there was a huge line). I also chatted with him that I saw one coming to Westwood (according to him, it's been the plan for quite a while but there's been some issues .. so opening date in LA is TBD). I got the Damon Bruce on the Dutch crunch bread (this is THE bread to get!). This sandwich was huge and delicious. My friend got a different sandwich, and we swapped halves.. we were gonna save the other half for drunk munchies but they were just so good, we ate them all at once in Dolores Park!The only reason I'd give this a 4 is that the prices are kinda high. Maybe I'm not too aware on gourmet sandwich prices, but it's a bit high for me. I can't see myself eating this too often in Westwood but it'd def be a treat!P.S. each sandwich comes with a bag of chips (get the one with lots of colors.. It's like a special BBQ flavor. So good!) and a little lollipop dessert!
The portion is huge! The sauce was amazing.There's a surprising comic effect when the person giving me the sandwich is the print on the sandwich bag. I like how he greets everyone with a warm handshake and a few comments about the sandwiches that we are getting.The girl at the cashier was kind of stupid though. We asked if there's any egg ingredient in the bread and she kept telling us that it's gluten free which has nothing to do with what we asked for. The place does look a little bit dirty but almost everyone grabbed sandwiches head to the park so no big deal.
The sign flashed open and there were customers at the register placing an order ahead of me. As soon as it was my turn up, the guy at the register disappeared without saying a word. A few seconds later another guy appeared telling me the place was closed. I pointed out that the sign was still on and there were other customer just in front of me. He shrugged his shoulders and said they were closed. I really like their sandwiches, but with shoddy customer service, I won't go back. I'm truly disappointed with the place and they should learn to treat their customers in a better manner.
Came to san fran had to check out this place and boy was it delicious! One of the best sandwiches ive ever had!!!
Really yummy but portions are wayyyyyyyy too huge! 2 people should share one. The queue is always pretty long but it moves fast. There's very limited seating area and there are always people waiting in the restaurant for the sandwiches.
Had the vegan pilgrim on dutch crunch bread. I'm a man of few words, I'll leave it to this: amazing.
All of my friends think I'm crazy when I come back from a trip to SF and I didn't go to Ike's, so I made it a point to grab a sub from there for lunch this past weekend! There is an overwhelming amount of sandwich options. My strategy was to know what kind of meat I wanted in my sandwich (roast beef) and ask the cashier what she recommended. Based off the cashier's recommendation, I chose "Nacho Boy!"Nacho Boy on Dutch Bread:-I am a strong believer that bread makes or breaks the sandwich, so with this bread being SO GOOD I already liked Nacho Boy from the beginning. The bread is crunchy, chewy, and not too flakey. YUM.-I was a little iffy about mushrooms with the cheese, roast beef, lettuce, avocado, and tomatoes, but it added the perfect amount of earthiness to the sandwich.-I am also a huge fan of complimentary flavor profiles which this sandwich completely accomplishes. The creaminess of the avocado with the earthy mushrooms and tangy tomato--oh man, I'm having major cravings now. Quick tips/notes: -Want to skip the ordering line? Call ahead and you can walk in and pay for your sandwich. This saves A LOT of time.-If you do end up waiting in line, stay to the right as much as possible. Apparently Ike's neighbors complain about so many people blocking the sidewalk. Too many complaints may cause Ike's to close, so please help them out.-free bag of chips and a caramel apple lollipop in the bag
Mange trois was nom nom verry yummy. On Sunday there was a line and I had to wait about 30 min to get my sandwich. It it's cool man if you're not in rich and visiting stop by and get one of their delicious sandwiches.
I ordered steak sandwich (No 135) on Dutch crunch, it was awesome... The best steak sandwich that I have ever tried. The meat was so soft and tasty.
I know that general Bay Area wisdom says that Ike's is the place to be, and I certainly do enjoy an opportunity to munch on one of their sandwiches.This 3-star review is being written from a vegan's perspective.The Ike's menu (secret and all) does a good job of covering all bases, but there just aren't enough vegan options that feel natural. Lots of meat substitutes. That seems to be their thing, and they do it VERY well if you're into it. Just not my cup o' tea.The service is always wonderful, and I certainly do enjoy the grub from time to time. It's just honestly never blown me away enough for a 5-star review.
We split the Matt Cain and hot mama hooda. Matt Cain was amazing. Delicious Dutch crunch bread. Took awhile to get our order even though we were there very early and not many people in front of us. The menu did not have all their sandwiches on it, so look online before you go. It would be nice if they had a little paper menu with all the sandwiches on it that you can read before ordering.
Not like Ike's needs another review, but why not. Line goes relatively quickly--make sure to know what you want when you get up to the cashier, otherwise prepare for some eye-rolling behind you.There is an extensive menu on line, but they only highlight a handful of their most popular sandwiches on their menu board.Once you get your sandwich, get out. Dolores is a decent walk away, or grab a curb.The good: good sandwiches whose prices are all palindromes. The bad: sandwiches take a while to come out.
Delicious food. The people that work there are very nice. The atmosphere is fun and clean. Can't wait to go back and try some more!
My Love introduced me to this place and i've never known. so happy to be put on because they have vegan and vegetarian sandwiches which are EVERYTHING
I shared the kryptonite and it was amazing. It had everything in it and it was HUGE. Got it on dutch crunch and it was perfect. The line is really long. No where to sit inside so you gotta eat in your car or find somewhere outside. I've been to other Ike's locations like oakland or redwood city and I did not like it there. I don't like any other location except this place. I'd give all the other places 2-3 stars. Plus this is the only place that has EVERYTHING on the menu where as the other places just has a few.
Being an SF native, I had high expectations for this place. I hear about it quite often. Well, 25 minutes later we finally received our sandwiches. Getting there when it opened , you don't expect to wait that long for a sandwich. But, that being said because we waited so long and the sandwich was cold, I can't comment too much on the flavor of a "hot" sandwich. We got a faux turkey and cranberry sandwich and a faux chicken sandwich with bbq sauce. Sandwiches were juicy , not overly flavorful, filling. The turkey sandwich lacked turkey, it had one thin slice. Their staff wasn't too friendly, but gave us caramel apple pops with our sandwiches. Not sure if I want to come back due to the wait. But glad I was able to try it.
Delicious!!!!! It is as good as the other reviews has raved. Ordered the Menage A Trois (5/5 stars) and Spiffy Tiffy (4/5stars). Each sandwich is spread with their special dirty sauce. Make sure you pick the dutch crunch bread. Sandwiches were $11-13 each but well worth it!
Unfortunately Ike's has gotten too crowded for its own good and they are no longer delivering the quality product that they once did. Additionally, with all of the to go orders that they do, the wait can sometimes be an hour after ordering which is not acceptable for a sub Sandwich. Also, if it's going to be an hour wait after ordering, they have an obligation to tell the customer, which they did not do.Their sandwiches are still good but don't have the love they once did and look more like ingredients thrown on a piece of bread than a hand crafted sandwich.
Hands down, BEST vegan sandwiches in the bay area!!!! My favorite is the vegan Pilgrim, tofurkey, cranberry sauce and sriracha mayo. OMG amazing! Ike, I am so happy you make sandwiches!!
It blows my mind that people consider this a 5-star sandwich place. You know what's a good sandwich? When someone spends days curing and/or braising meat for you, then puts it on a home-made bun with cheese on top, then broils it to make it nice, hot and crispy before you devour it.That is NOT what this is. This is a sandwich that you could very easily make for yourself by just going to the grocery store and then using ten times more mayo than any logical person would ever use. The result is a disgusting soggy mess. And the fact that you have to wait 20 minutes in line for the pleasure of a soggy sandwich is beyond words.It is so disappointing that California is OK with this. Someone should be able to make a decent sub sandwich around here. Now, there are some amazing Vietnamese sandwich places, but I'm hankering for a real American sandwich. Oh well... Hopefully some day.
One of the best sandwich places out there!!!My friend and I dropped in on this place while we were on our eating adventure on our 1 day SF trip.We ordered the Menage a Trois on Dutch Crunch Bread and.... #%$&%@^% why is it so freaking good??? I loved how moist the chicken was and the sweet sauce complimented the chicken so well. And the bread, the damn bread so was freaking good!!! Moist and crunchy on the outside.I will definitely revisit this place the next I'm in SF! nom nom ^^
Fantastic. I don't feel the need to write a review because everything has been said! Except I was shocked a sandwich that is 8 inches or so is $13 lol!
Ordered my fave (Paul Reuben) at 1pm to pick up at 4pm. I was running late and they called me at 4:05 pm to tell me they ran out of pastrami. Really?! They couldn't call me earlier or at least BEFORE my pick up time?! Super bummed I couldn't get my favorite sandwich before I went back to Socal after my weekend in sf :(
Hellllloooo Spiffy Tiffy! Avocado, Halal Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepper Jack, Pesto, Provolone. All of my favorite things in a sandwich, what could be better?Really glad that Ike's is expanding to the rest of the Bay Area!
Had to create an account on Yelp just to review this and share how wonderful it is to the world!I was just visiting San Francisco and had seen it on Man Vs Food and definetly wanted to try it out. But it's just a sandwich I thought, how good can it be? Well the best damn sandwich I've ever eaten and wins many burgers I've eaten as well! I had just finished having lunch while walking around Castro, but how I didn't want to go home without trying Ike's, I bought one for later. But such a waste to only eat it cold I kept thinking, and decided to have a few bites to try it fresh. Worst decision ever, it was like a drug. Until it was an appropriate dinner time all I wanted to do was attack the sandwich haha Like everyone says in the reviews, there are so many options! You need to step back and take a few minutes to decide which one you want. I had the Hollywood's SF Cheesesteak and defiantly would have it again but also would love to try many of the options. Also their bread is glorious, and I'm not a bread person. It was like garlic bread and it really made a diference. If you like food and traveling, while in San Francisco, Ike's place is a MUST. I have to go back one day...
Oh what would I do without Ike's! My office is right around the corner and am always in the mood for the Dutch Crunch!
Ike's Place is absolutely creative on the sandwich names. Some of these sandwiches are named after politicians, celebrities and athletes. I ordered "The Count of Monte Chase-o" with Ham, Strawberry Preserves, Swiss and Turkey plus Lettuce and Tomato. Their sandwiches are indeed delicious. They cut sandwiches in half so you can save the remainder for later or share it with someone. I'm craving for another sandwich as I write this review.Sure, there will be times when this place gets compared to other sandwich shops. A few of the other sandwich shops include Submarine Center and Subway. I can understand, there's almost no way in telling which sandwich shop makes the best sandwich without trying.Certainly, this maybe one of the busiest sandwich places. It does take some time for your food to be given to you. Sometimes the line will be long, but it does move quick. In a rush? Calling in your order ahead of time is definitely a very helpful solution.The menu is shortened, viewing the complete menu on their website with a smartphone is a very useful idea.I must admit that the sandwiches are a little pricey. But, delicious sandwiches are indeed worth the money spent and time waiting for it.Good food, good service, friendly staff members and efficient services. Overall, positive experiences at Ike's Place. Definitely one of my favorite go to spots for a sandwich when I'm nearby.Free Potato Chips and Caramel Apple Pops? Props for this part!
My boss has been raving about this place, so it was on my must try list when we visited San Fran. Decided on the vegan meatball sub, which didn't disappoint. However when I ordered the sides, the guy that took our order assured us they were vegan. When someone else gave us our food, he said " you know these aren't vegan, right?". A little bit concerning that all staff are not aware of what exactly on the menu is vegan friendly. All in all, great sub. Just emphasize the fact you're vegan if you are!
The hype is real.Got spiffy tiffy, matt cain, and manage a trois (all on dutch crunch) with everything on them. sandwiches were jam packed with meat, sauce, and toppings. It was tasty and flavorful but i can see why it can get too heavy/much. Parking is kinda bad. Price is okay. Line seems to always be there so be aware of that. Sandwiches come w a bag of chips.
Ike's Place is a legend in its own time. San Francisco is foodie heaven, and to become a renowned must-go place in such a short period of time says a lot about this food. It's so popular that the neighbors complained and forced Ike out of his original location. Pure San Francisco; can't have those greedy capitalist pigs, not in my back yard, make `em stay on Montgomery Street.Ike has been on my list of places to eat for a while, and I finally ate there, so here's my experience. As you can see, I gave it only three stars . . . as Stephanie M "[doesn't] see why anyone would give Ike's Place less than 5 stars", my experience was not quite food heaven.The problem wasn't actually going to Ike's. If you know that it's an investment of more than a few minutes, and you plan accordingly, it's fine. The flavor is "city hipster". Bare-bones interior with creative posters, no tables or chairs so it's practically takeout. I went at an off time, and most of the crowd was young City dweller. If you're a tourist looking for an authentic San Francisco feel, this is the place to be.Important: make sure you go online and pick out a few options before setting foot in Ike's. The line is long enough that you can select something when you get there. But they have many ingredients in the kitchen, and therefore have almost limitless options of sandwiches. As a result, the menu is huge. It's organized by their creative names, not by ingredients, which makes it difficult. Evenly divided by meats and vegetarian options. I even found several that my wife might be able to eat; due to intestinal issues, she's the opposite of a vegetarian, and I saw a few options for her (maybe Ike could load a sandwich down with meat `n cheese and call it "Everybody Must Get Crohned" :-p) But this is not NY's Soup Kitchen International, made infamous by "Seinfeld"; Ike Shehadeh is all about love, respect, and acceptance, and if you take too long at the register, he won't storm out of the kitchen like a Sandwich Nazi shouting "That's it! No sandwich for you!"I got the Pastrami-Charmed Life, and I'm sad to say that this brought the rating down. It was loaded with meat, but the pastrami's tangy taste was `noxiously neutered by the preposterous portion of cole slaw. The dirty sauce was good, but also served to smother the pastrami. Some of my mouthfuls tasted like meh. I'm someone who likes to save the best taste for last, and I noticed that I finished the sandwich before I finished the salt & vinegar potato chips. Uh oh.Now, this was my first time at Ike's, and there are a lot of combinations that are still waiting to be eaten. Or it could have been an off day for the kitchen staff, and they put too much cole slaw on by mistake. But I was quite underwhelmed by the food, and that was an incredible letdown. Ike, I love ya, Jesus loves ya too, but I had to settle on a 3-star rating. I do hope that some day I can raise that rating.
I really loved the sandwiches. The size is awesome! Big, tasty, flavorful, packed with your fav meats, veggies, and randoms. I really loved my sandwich and hope to return to try other ones! Yummy, filled up, neatly put together, and the sauce was on point. The menu is overwhelmingly large but there is a LONG LINE to give you time to decide. The long line to order isnt what kills me, its the wait for the sandwich after. I see a bunch of people working back there but it still takes 20 minutes to get out. There is no room to eat so we walked to some steps down the street to eat there. So I am caught in the middle as I felt this delicious sandwich was not worth the 15 minute line and 20 minute wait afterwards for the food....
This is my second time giving Ike's a try, and I got to say it's a good sandwich. That's debatable, though, depending on how you like your sandwiches. The sandwich I got (the Robin Williams) tasted great, but a majority of the flavor came from the large douse of sauce used in the sandwich. If you prefer your sandwiches delicious because of the non-sauce components of the sandwich, then you might not be too big of a fan of Ike's. It's also a bit pricey for a sandwich, but it's definitely two meals worth and a meal of decent quality.
Ordered a couple sandwiches to go and ate them after a couple minutes.First sandwich was the Matt Cain. The sandwich was incredibly soggy, way over slathered with "godfather sauce," and there was no consistency to the ratio of ingredients over the sandwich. The flavor was pretty good, but that sauce just completely dominated everything.I can't remember the name of the second sandwich, but it had ribeye, provolone, mushrooms, lettuce and tomato. It was the blandest sandwich I have ever tasted, and that beef was like a dog chew. No seasoning on the beef, no seasoning on the mushrooms, anemic tomatoes, a morsel of whatever their sauce is. These sandwiches aren't that cheap either. I'd give them a second chance down the road though, but I will never in a million years eat that discussing roast beef.
I am a sandwich lover and will eat almost ANY sandwich out there, but IKE's is BY FAR the best sandwich I have EVER had! It is definitely a grab-n-go place, but there are sandwich combinations all over the walls...almost so over-whelming that I wanted them to pick for me!
Ikes is the Panicle of fine sandwiches and bay area creativity. If I'm ever close to an Ike's location, I can think of a 72 reasons to spoil myself for the day and grab a menage a trois with avocado, and if I really want to ball out, Ill get it with fried chicken.
Alright so my friend was talking nonstop about how he wanted to try this sandwich place when we made our annual commute to SF for Opening Day baseball this year. I'm along for the ride, so sandwiches for lunch it is. I admit I was a little skeptical that this place wouldn't live up to the hype. But let me go ahead and verify it's legit hype with a 5 star Yelp! review! I almost docked a star because there's nowhere to sit and eat actually there, but I guess that's kind of an ongoing theme in the city and I can't fault Ike for it because I'm not reviewing the nonexistent seating, right? I'm reviewing the best sandwich I've EVER had. I had the Spiffy Tiffy with the pesto being the deciding factor amongst an overwhelming menu. The funny guy who took our orders said they were out of green pesto but that the red pesto was the best ever and he eats it like 5x/week. Red pesto? Never heard of such a thing but sign me up! Was it the amazing secret sauce?! Was it the red pesto?! Was it the traditional SF sourdough bread?! WHAT made this sandwich sooo delicious?! My friend ordered the Lincecum and we both inhaled our sandwiches last-meal-status like we were set to go to the electric chair. The best sandwich I've ever had and I don't even know why. Like so good that next time I'm in SF for Opening Day, my return flight will be in the afternoon so we can hit this place up for lunch before I waddle through airport security in black and orange Giants swag. Ike should open up one of these inside AT&T Park! Go, Giants!!
Great tasting sandwich... And that's the only good thing about Ike's. There was a long line and no where to sit once you get your food. The unisex bathroom door opens into the line of people waiting to order, so you get to dodge the door and smell human waste while deciding which sandwich you're hungry for. The bathroom is not regularly cleaned. At the register, there is a reminder to use protection to avoid getting AIDS and other STDs...???
Spiffy tiffy was delicious! Chicken with pesto and a bunch of other ingredients..Mnage a trois was good too, it was more on the sweet teriyaki tasting side so if you're in the mood for something sweet. I think eating it at Dolores park (about 10 min walking distance)in perfect weather made our sandwiches more enjoyable too. Overall it was a great experience.
i met Adam Richman and he told me to check out Ike's and order the Adam Richman.When you come into the shop, you will see a large blackboard filled with about 20 diff overwhelming sandwich combos. I asked what exactly was in the Adam Richman bc I wasnt quite ready to throw down an acid inducing meat fest for lunch that day. The cashier said something about a bunch of lunch meats, fried chicken, sauces...whatev, it sounded like a stomach ache. i got the reuben - briny pastrami, crunchy tangy purple slaw with 1000island/french dressing on dutch crunch bread. it was a good, but thick sammy. my bf got the menage a trois - halal chicken (which was shredded), bbq sauce, honey and i think cheese. it was a good too, more of a sweet flavor profile, like honey BBQ chicken. for every sammy, you get a bag of chips. there's not place to eat so it's grab n go. girls will probably eat half, boys can polish off the whole thing. each sandwich is about $10. street parking.
I've had the Matt Cain and Menage a Trois here. Both excellent and at the height of sandwich craft. Also, I can't think of a perfect way to pair a sandwich with than some Zapp's voodoo chips.We came in on an off hour during a Monday and it was surprisingly empty, but I suppose that's usually not the case. There was no seating as numerous reviews have indicated so we took everything to go and ate at home.I only wish that I could've tried the other 20 sandwiches they had... they also run out of the Dutch Crunch rolls, which was a bit disappointing. Anyways, it is a great sandwich place as the thousands of other reviews have also indicated.
Fast, friendly and affordable. I was actually surprised at their combinations. I was expecting it to be disgusting but it was the best sandy I've had all week.(and I'm a foodie)
Maybe it's because I came so late in the day, BUT I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED!! They ran out of LETTUCE! I mean really?!?! AND they ran out of AVOCADO!! so sad!! Then, I got my sandwich, and the bread was super soggy!! :( I was so sad. Regardless though, the flavors were amazing. I got the Menage-Trois which is sweet and delicious and amazing, while my friend got the Spiffy Tiffy which also looked super good. Overall, disappointing trip to Ike's, maybe I'll go to another location next time.
I am not a sandwich person. But this isn't just a fantastic sandwich, this is a sandwich worth a pilgrimage for- and I make it, every time I get a chance to be in the Bay area. The Menage a Trois is consistently just as good as you remember (which is to say, the best sandwich you've ever had). Management is also INCREDIBLY nice, though often busy since the line is out the door.This is one place worth the hype.
We came here because we got lost in San Francisco, apparently in the castro district (). So we went for a walk after finally finding a parking spot (holy mother of beer!) and after passing many delicious looking places. We ended up talking to a native who lived less than a block from ike's (right where we had parked) and she said "ike's is in all the papers, you should definitely try it!"So try we did! We didn't just try we INHALED a Matt Cain (or the 18) sandwich, with the happy hour chips, and happy hour huckleberry soda. Happy hour is mon-fri 3-6 (i think, don't quote me) and you get free chips, and a free canned soda or a dollar off a bottled beverage. They had lenninade, butterscotch beer, and a bevvy of other unusual sodas. I chose the huckleberry soda, and it was delicious. Very sweet, just what the doctor ordered. Oh, and ONE sandwich was enough for both me and my boyfriend. When starving! Though we could've eaten more. We're definitely stopping here next time for the godfather, of course. The sandwich, the staff, the soda, everything here but the parking was perfect.
If you don't know about Ike's Place, you're probably new to the area.Welcome to the area!Now get your butt to Ike's.Yes, there's a line. Yes, it's worth it. Make friends with the people standing with you. It'll be awesome.There are ways to avoid the lines, young padawan, but since you've just discovered Ike's just now, we'll leave those next-level Ike's maneuvers to the pros.If you're vegetarian, try the Blind Date or the Love Triangle. Extra dirty. You're welcome.(Hey, Ike's, y u no open later? Dinner! We eat it!)
I had the McCain and it was delicious. I navigated SF on the Muni, so it was convenient getting there, but it was certainly worth the trip! It was delicious!
Last time I gave them 3 star this time I don't even think they deserve a star. When I called for my order I ask them to put the onion rings on my sandwich, however when I got my sandwich my onion rings are not in my sandwich. I'm just angry that they charge me extra $$$$ for the onion rings and not give it to me. At least tell me you are out of onion rings and don't charge me for something you don't have. This is like the third time it has happened to me. I will not be back here anymore as I have lost my trust at this place. If I do return which I doubt I will return I will check my sandwich to make sure everything I add will be on it. I might not even go to the one in SF State or the one in San Mateo as I lost full trust to this place. Will I return: HELL NO
Ike's sandwich is like having sex.Let me explain:Your first time, after all the great things you've probably heard, and how it is heavenly and magical with unicorns caressing you, with fireworks and rainbows in the sky, is bound to be a huge disappointment. In the backdrop of such huge expectations, nothing in this world could realistically hope to appease your aspiration for the senses.But while it wasn't all that, you look back and realise how it was not that bad either. Not so bad that you don't want to go back and try it just one more time. Just to be sure, y'know?With expectations set straight, and no longer a virgin (in sandwich or sex --- take it whichever way you want), your second, third, and succeeding rounds just get better and better.And before you know it, you wonder how you ever lived without it.Such is life, sex, and sandwich from Ike's (ummm, only the sandwich is from Ike's).P.S.: Go ahead, you may light that cigar now.
Stop whatever you are doing and try this place out, there is a reason it has 6000+ reviews. I had the Friends with benefits with honey mustard and drooled over every bite, even when I was full I couldn't stop eating. Fun vibe, kid that was delivering food to people was hilariously. Dolores park is super close so go there to eat and enjoy!
Love these sammys. Definitely get 2 because they're even better later when you think you've had all you could possibly eat for one day.Everyone I know loves the chicken sandwiches there; personally, I love all of them except the chicken ones... just tastes too much like fresh chicken for my taste.
The kryptonike is good but i was told otherwise. Being from LA someone told me if i ever come to san fransisco to try ikes place that specific sandwitch its "huge" i was told it turned out to be 2 subs? Why....30 bucks?...i feel i went to the wrong ikes place ....the sandwich was good but not the best.
Name of the Girl You're Dating. Some Devine-Ass Halal Chicken. Xcuse my french. But I am so glad there is more than one location, especially the one in Oakland. But this is a gem. The staff is superb, the sandwiches gets hand delivered. You get a bag of chips along with your meal. I got the dutch crunch bread, but I hear that the french bread is pretty great too. I asked the staff which kind of bread he'd preferred, he said he has been working there for over a year, and although dutch crunch is amazing, the french bread is extremely soft and goes so well with the chicken. I will try that the next! But! back to NOTGYD sammy, the avocado and and creamy chicken together was HEAVEN. I am in love! Jalapeno Business kettle chips ftw!
TRY:The Pilgrim:-4.5/5Came here for the first time and I got the pilgrim on sourdough bread. I've got to say this has got to be the best sandwich I've had in a long time. Imagine thanksgiving but in sandwich form. It had vegan turkey, havarti cheese, sriracha, cranberry sauce, lettuce and tomatoes. Everything together was amazing. Foodgasm in my mouth! The only thing I did not taste was the sriracha or any hint of it at all. The sandwich is pretty huge and they include your choice of chips and a caramel apple pop to satisfy sweet tooth cravings!Total: $11 I am definitely coming back to try more sandwiches!
The gist: Super long lines had me wishing I was at the Oakland location. I love Ike's. But 1.25 hours waiting for a sammy ain't worth it for me. Don't come on a Sunday afternoon. They just kept running out of stuff (such as chicken) and having to have ppl choose substitutions. I do like that this location gives you free chips with your order. They have some awesome chips.I feel bad giving them 2 stars when really their sandwiches are fantastic, but I think it's fair to look at Ike's holistically. If you love waiting in lines like most people, then this'll be great. But save yourself the trouble and just head over to the 19th street location.
Ikes is good but in all honestly its not worth the wait and price. If you have alot of time on your hands and have money to spend on over priced sandwiches i would recommend Ikes
There sandwich's are really good.... I got the menage a tois and it was really tasty.... The only thing I got to complain about it is that they don't have any kid meal options, I had to order a regular sized sandwich for my daughter that cost over $10 bucks..... They don't have different sizes
The only thing I am sad about was that I couldn't check in when I was actually here. Boo data plan.Here's a tip: call-in to order your food. I heard line can get long and it's a small place so it can get crowded. They're proper so they won't confuse your order either. First and last name along with your number for pickup.What I got? Sometimes I'm a vegetarian. The order and a real statement. Included: lettuce, tomatoes, grilled artichoke, mushroom, pesto and provolone cheese. I think it's provolone cheese! YUMMMM. I swear it has some special sauce or something too, but I couldn't wrap my head around the idea that it's just those ingredients to make it so good. It's a good portion; I saved half for later. It is really good. Believe the hype, y'all. I never had artichokes in a sandwich before and hate eating foods that may break apart but man this was worth getting lost while taking the bus for! Sad part: I didn't get it on the Dutch crunch bread like other Yelpers suggested. Only because I was making a large order. Your order comes with a bag of chips of your choice. Select at the store. Service: the person who took my order on the phone was super nice. He was very patient too knowing I had a large order. When we got to the place everything was ready for pick up and he even allowed us go pay separately. No hassles! Already bagged and with a little sweet surprise for us. Pun intended.Thank you, Ike's for making bomb sandwiches and having an awesome staff. Got food lovers like me wanting to go back to SF for moooooooaaaaarrrrrr!!! (:
Ike's is a popular sandwich place (no duh) and that gave me very high expectations when I went with a friend. And it exceeded it!I got the Matt Cain with added bacon and it was the bomb dot com!! I loved the grandfather sauce and truth be told, the bacon was not needed (though it makes everything better) as the sandwich was already very meaty. My friend got the Nacho Boy and that wasn't bad either.The decor isn't that nice, there is not table to eat on, and the sandwiches are a little pricey but it's whatever.
soooooo... i haven't been on yelp in forever, but I feel that my experience today has brought me to a whole new level of IRRITATION. Thats enough to bring me back out of retirement and i'm now here to share how I wasted my lunch hour...Used to come pretty often, but after todays visit... I'm pretty sure I won't be back. Don't think my coworkers will be back either. Like the other review...just go to Roxie's!!!! it's also a local joint and a corner liquor store sandwich spot...no nonsense and delicious! anways...back to the review...We placed a phone order before 11:30am for a 12:15 pick-up and purposefully got there at 12:30 cause its normal for them to be backed up. We park, walk up and am instantly blown away by the madness that is IKE's...also find out that the girl in the front doesn't know WTF shes doing. It was total chaos inside (imagine the scene from "Mean Girls" where they're at the mall and Lindsay Lohan is comparing teenagers to the wild animals at the watering hole in Africa). I get it...its IKE's but... WHAT. THE. HELL. No one knew which line to be in, some people didn't even know where to go and were wandering around the tight space aimlessly asking other customers for help The line to order was out the door, and the "pick-up" line was all kinds of fekked up. It was hot as a gorillas ballsack in there and I wasn't about to sit around and wait for something to happen...meaning i'm not going to wait for a worker to actually do their job and calm down the madness...because 10minutes had passed already and no one was taking initiative to do s#it. I'm glad i'm more direct and don't sit around and wait, and I took it upon myself to check with the girl at the register. Asked her a few basic questions:"Hi. Is this where we pay and pick up for phone orders?""Are the sandwiches ready?""How long will the wait be since we ordered OVER AN HOUR AGO"she responded with:"I'm kinda new here. I don't know" ::insert head tilt/dumbass blank stare:: and no other response...phone rings and she sits there listening while i'm assuming...shes taking an order... my coworkers asks again...and she acts like she doesn't hear anything. She finally answer with " I don't know-i'm new here". By now...EVERYONE WAITING FOR A RESPONSE IS PISSED!after her neglect in trying to find an answer, a few more customers standing around started to chime in. Customers who had already placed phone orders, that had been standing around waiting for help and hadn't been acknowledged, and were wanting to 1) talk to the manager, 2) wanted refunds or 3) both. and still...NOTHING except the same response "I don't know-i'm new here". The thing that peeves me, is that she did not try to make any situation better, she didn't even try to find her manager...she just stood there while the other girl at the register took care of the line and the phone orders.I can go on and on and on and on about the bs customer service. but i won't.Check the stats: We phone order at 11:20am, we get there at 12:30 pm, we ask for assistance at 12:40pm, get a dumass response multiple times from 12:40-1:00), don't get any response until after 1pm (when we receive 3 of 4 sandwiches), and we don't get our last sandwich til 1:15pm. I'm sure the situation could have and SHOULD have been handled differently coming from the business side of things...if you know its a beautiful day in the front...1) Don't put a newbie up front , 2) Don't stand there like a dummy and NOT TRY TO HELP YOUR CUSTOMERS-DO SOMETHING AND FIGURE SHIT OUTi'm so irritated right now...i don't even care about spelling, grammar, and punctuation.ohhhhhhhh.... and.....our sandwiches were poorly wrapped and halfway hanging out of the paper...so our sandwiches were pretty gross looking too. Ike's is ikes. I love the sandwiches...but I also make decisions on where I will continue to go based on my experiences and customer service. This is place is no no and no go for me for future trips... and being truthfully honest...using MY TIPPING METER...i'd say that i'd never tip them based on this...and that they'd owe me a sandwich or 2 for the waste of time and the awful service we received. #IJS
Slammin'. Got the Robin Williams. My buddy got the Damin Bruce. Both of us agreed it was the best thing we'd had thus far. It's not really a sit down restaurant. You walk up to the register, order, and wait. Great food. You won't be disappointed.
This place doesn't need another review, so I'll offer a few limited tips:1) They seem to be very conscious of their neighbors and asked us to please not sit on any nearby stoops while we were waiting and eating. I thought this was awesome and very respectful. If the front of the store is full, I suggest eating in the park as opposed to the sidewalk!2) This place is great for vegetarians. It's really easy to turn any sandwich into a veg with all of their tofu styled options.3) Great service. Happy people make great food!4) Yes there's a line. Yes it's worth it.
A little longer wait for your sandwich. It's overprice and the chips are no longer free. The taste is good and it's because of the sauce. BUT bottom line it's a pricey above average sandwich.
We came down to the city for a little nosh and ended up at Ike's. It was one of the best sandwich places I have been at. I had the Backstabber which was chicken, artichoke hearts, lettuce, and tomatoes. The great part was the flavors and the bread, which I hear is baked in the resteraunt. The other people I was with, greatly liked their sandwiches as well. Meatless meatball and turkey and cranberry. All sandwiches come with chips and are well worth the price, all around $9.00. The flavor was just great and the service was good. This is a take out only place with no seating for eating, but we went up to the library to sit and eat in their little garden. The place was old so it looked a little dirty, but I understand that. I will return to try out their other concoctions, as everyone I was with said they enjoined experience and the food!
I've heard so many good things about Ike's Place but have only recently had the time to venture out to the Castro to try it out myself. I came here on a Saturday at 3:30pm and amazingly only had to wait about 30 minutes in line before I ordered and got my sandwich! You'll see that a lot of reviewers complain about how long the wait can be so my recommendation is just to go at "weird" times. Only downside to this is that Ike's apparently runs out of their famous dutch crunch rolls very quickly, so I didn't have a chance to try it :( I ordered the Change (bbq, beer battered onion rings, cheddar, thinly sliced rib eye) and my girlfriend ordered the Menage A Trois (bbq, cheddar, halal chicken, honey mustard, pepper jack, real honey, swiss) and both sandwiches were hands down the best sandwich(s) I've ever had in my life. With a menu as big as theirs (over 100 sandwiches), it's amazing how both of these tasted like perfected recipes. The sandwiches here are a bit on the saucy side so be prepared to get messy. Portions are also massive, so one sandwich will be good for probably two meals for most.
Definitely over hyped! The menage a trois on crunch dutch was tasty... You get that contrast of sweetness from their sauce and chicken and it works.. But... Then after eating the first half the sandwich just taste too sweet for me. Good thing i came here at 2pm.. I would not be lining up for this sandwich at lunch peak times. There is a bathroom hereThis is not a sitdown and eat place.. You get your sandwich and you eat it.. Outside standing or sitting down on edge of sidewalk or walking or in your car. Street parkingEasy place to get to from Muni and bartI will give this sandwich place another try.. Maybe their other options are better..?
I don't really care about sandwiches. Like seriously, what is the big deal? With that said, Ike's Place is the exception to my apathy. This place is awesome. There are a lot of options all with flavorful and unique combinations. I got a chicken sandwich with avocado and other stuff. Sorry, I am not more specific. The whole experience was a mind blur and I am having a hard time recalling the details. My mouth was too busy for my brain to keep up. I can say with complete confidence that it was the best sandwich I have ever had and I dream about going back. This is a no frill good food place. They don't even have tables, but you can eat on a bench packed next to strangers.
This is the ultimate sandwich place! I tried this place about 3 years ago, on my firs trip to San Francisco. The only thing on my agenda was Ike's place. At that time they were going trough a relocation so I was able to visit them @ The Lime. We were able to order ahead and have a drink and a place to sit. This time around it was a little different. We had our 15 month old in tow and I was kind of worried about the "seating" since I knew there wouldn't be any this time. We were meeting a friend there and were in no rush. We were able to have a through view of the menu and drooled at every ingredient. I first chose the Hot Mama Huda; hala chicken, franks red hot sauce, provolone, lettuce and tomato. Luckily the cashier suggested the M.I.L.F essentially the same sandwich minus the provolone and add a jalapeno popper! So there! She also informed me that it was cheaper! SCORE! I had it on Ike's famous Dutch Crunch bread and delicious dirty sauce. I quickly snapped a picture of it before scarfing it down. It was total food porn. Mmmm! I am sadden to live so far away but heard that there is talks of opening one near UCLA.
The line is quite long, but a great place to take visitors. Grab a sandwich and go to Dolores Park.
Ike's definitely makes the best sandwiches I've ever had. Whenever I'm here, my eyes float past the prices and straight to the sandwiches. This place is packed way out the door whenever I'm here, but I'm not surprised. The sandwiches are that damn good! I'm from SoCal, but I always make a trip here whenever I'm in San Jose/Francisco. Regardless of how busy my schedule is, I will always make time to get a sandwich here. I don't even know what my personal sandwich would be called... I just fill it with everything on the menu! Be aware: there are no tables here, so it's strictly to-go, unless you want to sit on their small bench inside. I would take this opportunity to explore San Francisco, sandwich in-hand. Bring some friends, some patience, and a huge appetite... it's worth it.
The best sandwich ever made. I honestly don't know what else to say. It's not cheap for sandwiches, but it's so worth it!
This place is amazing! Lots to choose from (and most are super good- I just didn't like the vegan chicken too much). Staff is very nice and they give you your sandwich with lots of napkins (this I appreciate very much) and a lollipop!
Great food and great service! Perfect take home (or park) sandwich that can easily be shared between 2 people.
Came in randomly for takeout sandwiches for lunch. Always love this place as their sandwiches are amazing and the staff is friendly. The only problem is parking in the area but that has nothing to do with the staff or the restaurant. This isn't the only store I have been to but they are all so good.
Love this place! It seems like the long lines is a usual thing so beware. I've tried the Paul Reuben and the Hollywood..something with their world famous ike's bread. They were both very good and I absolutely love their sandwiches. It is worth the price! If you pay with cash, they will give you a free soda so that's pretty cool. They also give you a bag of chips and a lollipop along with your order! It's a sandwich to-go kinda place. People usually sit in their limited seating area while they wait for their order and don't really sit there to eat. We actually ordered the sandwiches and then drove to the beach to eat. Eating in the car is also another idea if you're from out of town like us but it gets a bit messy.
I loved this place. I did. The sandwichesAre great. I don't know if it's the tech boom or what but their service has gone to shit. Not only was I hung up on 3 times while trying to make an order, it actually took me over an hour to make the order, but when I came back at their specified pickup time an hour later the damn sandwich wasn't even ready. What a bunch of crap.
What can be better than a nice, hearty sandwich after hiking up Twin Peaks on a sunny SF day? This is precisely what I did with friends over St. Paddy's Day weekend. We worked up an appetite and needed carbs, protein, and salt to refuel. FOOD- I took Yelpers' advice and got the GOING HOME FOR THANKSGIVING on Dutch Crunch bread. I couldn't resist the tempting description of cranberry sauce, havarti, Siracha, and turkey. But really, it was the Siracha that lured me in. - The sweet cranberry sauce and spicy Siracha made a great combo with the turkey and havarti. I wish they put a bit more Siracha to kick it up a notch. The Dutch Crunch bread was fluffy with a nice, crispy crust. I was surprised the it was more on the salty side, but it paired well with the sweet and savory sauce. - Sandwich did get soggy due to abundance of sauce--make sure you grab extra napkins! All sandwiches come w/ a complimentary bag of chips and a lollipop. Not a bad lunch combo!DRINKS- GINGER ALE: fresh ginger crushed up in this bottle made this a refreshing drink especially on a warm day. ATMOSPHERE- This location has a bit of "hole in the wall" feeling in regards to size. There are a few chairs to sit on as you wait for your sandwich, but do not expect tables to sit down at and eat. This is a grab and go situation. - Bathroom was roomy but the layout of the line to order blocks the door. Sometimes you don't know if the person in front of you is waiting in line for the bathroom or to place an order, which leads to awkward shoving and shuffling of people in a cramped area.Came here to grab sandwiches for a post-hike picnic in Dolores Park on a sunny weekend afternoon. I will definitely come here again because it looks like their menu options are endless.
I bought a sandwich @ Ike's recently, went down the street to eat it in peace under a nice tree and was chased away by an Ike's employee. They said the people in the neighbor complained that they didn't want Ike's customers in the neighborhood. I did comply and walked down a couple more blocks.Looking back, I should of told that Ike employee to go fuck themselves or give me a refund back. And fuck the people that live in those houses too. They don't own those streets, its a public place.
SUMMARY:Dutch crunch = always heavenly.Ginger soda = fresh, strong, tasty.Chips = go with the salt & pepper.Menage a Trois = always get on dutch crunch. A slightly sweeter sandwich from the honey mustard. Add avocado if you love the stuff like me. Stick with halal chicken if you like really tender meat, do fried if you like thick crunchy breading.Thanksgiving = a good shout-out to Thanksgiving leftovers. Turkey comes in slices. Cranberry sauce makes it even sweeter.Tried something new to an old fave based on a friend's rec: Menage a Trois with FRIED chicken (versus halal). While their fried chicken has a really thick crispy breading, I found I actually prefer the much more tender and moist meat of the halal! Plus the lighter breading just gives you better access to the meat.Also shared the Thanksgiving (turkey, cranberry sauce, probably some other Thanksgiving tastiness that I'm missing) with a friend - of course on dutch crunch as well. Tasty, on the sweet side b/c of the cranberry. Wished the turkey was cut they way it actually would be off of a whole roast turkey, in thick moist chunks. But I guess that would be logistically harder to eat than the slices they have in this sandwich.
THE KRYPTONITE. The substance that brings Superman to his knees has now arrived in sandwich form to affect all humans in the same way. While not on the menu, I ordered the Kryptonite at the register and the guy did not bat an eye and told me my total was $30 and some change for sandwich, chip and drinks. I about near fainted then, but handed over my credit card and gritted my teeth as I cursed my friends who had praised of its culinary genius and thought "this better be good". It wasn't long before a guy with a brown bag walked out and called my name as he grinned and said, "You ordered a BIG sandwich" and I said "yes I did" as I scuttled over to the bench to examine my purchase. I pick up half the sandwich, my friend picked up the other half and together we shared in what may be called a religious experience. The bread was amazingly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Honestly if you asked me what exactly was in the kryptonite I wouldn't be able to tell you, just that it was a beautiful mass of meats, cheese, avocado, bacon, onion rings, and other misc. items but I can tell you it was damn good and I wouldn't hesitate to spend $30 again on that glorious sandwich. "If I go crazy then will you stillCall me SupermanIf I'm alive and well,Will you be there a-holding my handI'll keep you by my sideWith my superhuman mightKryptonite"Thanks Ike for letting me have that song/sandwich stuck in my head all day.
Every sandwich is art! Everyone is always complaining about the line. Soooo fucking worth it! I've been making special trips out to San Fran because I get the craving for Ike's. Don't miss out because the line. You will be satisfied! Nom nom!
The reviews for this place speak for themselves! I heard about Ikes Place prior to taking a trip to San Fran several months ago and had to try it! I can honestly say it was the best decision made on our trip. Amazing sandwiches! Their dutch crunch bread is to die for and their secret dirty sauce is soooooo gooood....I totally regret just going their once in our stay in San Fransisco :( Ikes Place, I cant wait until we meet again...
Food 8.5/10Customer Service 8/10Comfort 7.5/10Price Value 8/10Overall 8/10Ike's sandwich is nice little restaurant joint(now expanding) and has a large variety of sandwiches. Usually sandwiches average around $10-$15 depending on what you get but... it is quite delicious. I still remember the first time when i went there and was just thinking it was just a hype.... but then i ordered the sandwich called "fat bastard" and that was a life changing experience. Didn't known sandwiches was capable of being that good tastin' finger lickin' good. Overall a recommended place for anyone that loves sandwiches and definetaly a place to try if you got the money for it. recommended for everyone.
First and foremost I have to thank yelp! for pointing me to this amazing sandwich shop!!!!Let me start of by saying I am in no way a Sandwich Fan, I will eat a sandwich if thats all that is available, but I will not go out of my way for one, ever, well until now that is.So we were wandering all over SF and got to searching through the yelp! App for somewhere new to eat, cause as anyone in SF knows trudging up and down the hills in this city makes you ravenous. So my buddy found Ikes in the list and I of course protested, ugh not sandwiches, but in the end I lost so we made our way to Ikes. And boy was i not disappointed!!!So we go inside and the line was wicked long but we decided to wait it out. So we get to the counter and my buddy has a dairy allergy, which can make things interesting, but the girl knew her stuff, and double checked with the manager just to be sure. There are so many choices, and apparently even more online, so I order the The Damon Bruce, Beer Battered Onion Rings, Provolone, Steak Sauce, thinly sliced rib eye, on the dutch crunch. So we wait and get our sandwiches and head out, although there was a pretty nice scene made by some crazy neighbor lady who thought the sidewalk was to dirty and would be absolutely disgusting in 4 days time, and thought it needed to be cleaned immediately, like drop everything you are doing and do it now.So we head down the street and find a curb pop a squat, and open the sandwiches. This thing was out of control, first bite and I was hooked. The bread was fresh and crisp. This thing could be considered a hot mess, the cheese was gooey and just falling apart, which added to it wonderfulness!!I will travel however for is necessary to gorge myself on the Ike's goodness!
Awesome place for sandwiches but horrible location as parking is impossible. But then again, we're talking about San Francisco, so parking will always be a challenge. After about 15 mins of circling around the neighborhood, I finally found parking on the Main Street. For some reason when I first drove by the spot, I was expecting a super long line out the door as it was lunch time I and I arrived there about 1230pm. I walk in and was expecting a full seating area but there were only a couple of seats along the wall and a bench. There were only a couple of people ahead of me to order the food. During my wait in line, the supplier Sysco was hauling in their meats and cheese. I noticed they use foster farm chicken which I'm very pleased as I know the meat I'm eating is quality grade.I end up ordering the Stiffy Tiffy and Menage A Trois. Both on Dutch crunch bread with all the fixings except for mustard.Stiffy Tiffy was super delicious and my jaw actually locked on me when I took my first bite because it was enormous (no homo). Check out my picture and you'll know what I mean. The sandwich had tons of avocado, great taste of the pesto shredded chicken and all the other fixings. My only disappointment was the bread as I'm used to a Crunchy bread. There's a reason why it's called Dutch crunch right? Menaga a trois was good, not as big as the Stiffy Tiffy though. This sandwich consisted of BBQ, real honey and of course the pesto chicken. I dunno if I would order this sandwich again as it was recommended by the cashier.Both sandwiches weighed a good 2lbs each and I wanna say if I wasn't supper starving, I would of been content with half of sandwich. Every order comes with a bag of chips. I decided to go with the mesquite BBQ and honey BBQ. I was expecting the chips to be kettle style but they were super thin like lays chips yet super salty. Wasn't a fan of this and end up throwing half of the chips away.Overall, I would make another trip out to this place and try the other sandwiches. Also, with the sandwiches being a little over $9 each, you definitely pay for what you get.
I can always count on this place after/during a long day at Dolores! If it was just a little cheaper.....
Looks like prices are going up here because the price of the mnage a trois went up to $12.27 and a bag of chips added $1.19 extra and they also ask if we want lollipops now (which I didn't care for anyway). Overall, this is still a great tasting sandwich and if you participate in United Airlines of American Airlines dining programs, you can get miles for dining here! This is great if you need to reset your mileage clocks so your miles don't expire!
Yum. We're just friends is delicious and super filling. Hundreds of sandwich options, fun people, and a love everything vibe. Best part was the free caramel apple lollipop! Take your sandwich for a walk to Dolores Park, you won't regret it.
On my short but delicious visit to san fran my girlfriend and i decided to stop by. We picked up one sammich and one to go. The first we split and made it dirty with onion rings and jalepno poppers. The second we ate after a night of drinking. Sweet jebus, probably the best decision of our lives! The bread is very good and the ingredients are great as well. -TipDon't overload the sandwiches with fillers
I've been a fan of these delicious sandwiches since stumbling upon one in Santa Clara. This one star review has to do with he utter chaos that is this SF store. 5 mins to get to the front of the line, pay for my order, and over 50 mins (still waiting!) for the two sandwiches. It is completely understandable that others may have called in their bulk orders, but it is insanity to not set expectations with walk-in customers who are trying to get lunch for the day. Folks are just walking out because they need to get back to work. Suggestion: put up a wait time or limit catering/bulk orders do that walk-ins do not suffer. I'm used to waiting for great food, especially in SF, but this is totally ridiculous Ike's!!!
I have a gripe...Five (or so) years ago at the original Ike's location, I fell in love with a sandwich called Stupid Eggplant. Breaded eggplant in marinara sauce, lettuce, tomatoes with their "Dirty Sauce" on Dutch Crunch, I've been adding on mozzarella sticks making it to be the most gluttonously delicious, caloric (albeit meatless) sandwich that is known to man (not really). I was immediately hooked and have been ordering this sandwich consistently ever since. Well, some time ago they started calling this combo the Yoshi but along with the name change the sandwich started having a different affect on me. Before it was consistently mouth wateringly fantastic and I've always finished with a mental "wow" and I've basked in the feeling of satisfaction after the sandwich had been devoured. But I was finding that I was no longer reacting that way.I couldn't quite figure out what it was. Was I just getting tired of this sandwich? All the ingredients are there but what exactly is different about it? I wasn't sure but the other day I ordered it and took a good look at it. Indeed, there was a difference and I'm sure it is dependent on who makes the sandwich but this is what I noticed:- more shredded lettuce appears to be filling up the sandwich - only hints of Marinara sauce (I don't need it dripping with it but sauce was hardly noticeable) - and the biggie... there are less or smaller mozzarella sticks. Perhaps it's because on the Yoshi it's included and no longer considered an "add on" (read: you aren't paying extra for it) but it was noticeably lessYeah, yeah I suppose the above is better for your health but come on, no one is going to Ike's Place and expecting to have a low calorie, healthy meal. In fact I have to calculate it to the day's caloric intake and try to have a good workout after (usually). It's definitely no longer the same sandwich I first fell in love with some years back so I no longer order it as often as I used to. I'm pretty sure this sandwich contains a surplus of 1000+ calories, so it's a good thing, really. I guess.
Creative sandwiches and delicious ingredients. The sandwich was so massive and filling, even in two sittings I couldn't finish it. The dutch crunch was so soft and soaked in sauces-- *heaven in my mouth*. I got the "Mrs. Robinson" - Fried chicken, Frank's Red Hot, ranch, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, red onion, and pickles, all on a delicious Dutch crunch roll.  Can't wait to go back and try something else!
Bomb.com!!!! My friends and I decided to see what the hype was all about. Well, it was definitely with the wait. I ordered the Mnage A Trous and mm mm mm - add the mozzarella sticks and jalapeo poppers for an extra kick!! Plus, we met Ike himself when he was giving us our order. Loved it. Thank you for the great service, food, and experience! Will be back the next time we're in SF!
Came here with my brother after we landed. I was so hungry! I got the pastrami and it was pretty good but I asked for jalapeos and they only gave me 2. My brother got the chicken with avocado and he said it was okay. I thought it needed more texture to it because it was a little mushy. I liked mine better. We paid $29 for two sandwiches, 2 bags of chips, and 3 drinks. Pretty pricey for a sandwich.
So dang delicious! Just eat here. Been here twice and their Menage A Trois (BBQ sauce, Cheddar, Halal Chicken, Honey Mustard, Pepper Jack, Real Honey, Swiss) is to die for. Every bite is a savory blend of sweet honey bbq sauce drenched over their tender chicken and cheese. Every sandwich is pretty large and I fill up with just half! Line is always a little long so plan to come early or wait 10-15 to get to the register.
Is it worth a four dollar a person round trip on the metro from Union Square just for a sandwich? YES. YES. YES.Again, I have to give credit where it is due and thank my foodie boyfriend from randomly coming at cross yelp reviews for this place while we were in SF. After reading reviews we knew we just had to go, or at least he really really wanted to go and I was willing to semi oblige despite complaining about it being completely out of the way. I'm so glad I decided to agree. This place knows how to make sandwiches!!!We went on a Friday afternoon around 3-4 and luckily there was no line. We got our sandwiches in about 10 minutes and even got lucky enough to grab a seat on the one and only bench area inside. I ordered the "hot mommy huda" because I love buffalo sauce and added onion rings inside. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. Everything, absolutely everything about the sandwich added to the perfection of the sandwich. The chicken was tender and moist, not deli processed chicken meat, the buffalo sauce was perfect and not overbearing, the ranch and provolone were both warm and melted into the perfect dutch crunch roll. It was worth every stretchmark. I would recommend getting the voodoo potato chips brand as well, it was great, although I tried my best to save stomach space for the sandwich from heaven. I also enjoyed the few bites of my boyfriend's sandwich as well concluding that you truly cannot go wrong here. So buy the metro pass, or walk fast and get yourself to Ike's, because you will NOT leave disappointed.
This place is a unique experience for sandwiches. The ingredients in the sandwiches were delicious! Even the drinks and chips were unique. I can't wait to go here again. My friend has the "ex-girlfriend" and I had a modified "menage  trois" (bacon instead of the cheeses, add lettuce)  Both were awesome!Definitely will return!
This is a place you go when you want to pick up a hearty sandwich and be on your way. I ordered the Spiffy Tiffy Pros: YUMMYBIG full sandwiches vegetarian friendlyquick pick upYou can call it in and pick it up, no need to wait in line. price is fair for what they offerCons:busy busy busy No parkingThe wait from a call-in order can take 1-2 hours depending on the day they are having.
10/10 would lick caramel apple lolipop after finishing my sandwich again.
TIP #1: Sign up for their emails because you get a free sandwich on your birthday!!! You also get coupons for BOGO and what not! Def worth it!TIP #2: Don't come if you're in a rush. Lines are usually long and food may take awhile to come out.Menage A Trois: The first sandwich I ever tried, and I fell in love.Matt Cain: Do you like roast beef and salami? Get this!Kryptonite: This is a sandwich to be shared. It costs $20! Avocado, bacon, beer battered onion rings, corned beef, EXTRA Pepper Jack, Ham, mozzarella sticks, pastrami, pesto, roast beef, salami, stuffed jalapeno poppers, and turkey. It is amazeballs.[Name of Girl I'm Dating]: Ike's got jokes! Got this one time. It was good, but not as amazing as the first three I listed.But honestly, I've never had a bad experience at Ike's. All their sandwiches are filled with an explosion of flavor. Half a sandwich fills me up pretty nicely, and I save the other half for 1-2 hours later ;)
I know this is redundant to say considering the volume of positive reviews, but Ike's has amazing sandwiches. Initially, I was looking for a restaurant that was part of the dining program I'm enrolled in, and then my partner mentioned Ike's Place's stellar reputation. After reading all the reviews on Yelp, I knew I'd have to try it. Ike's is known for having long lines, but I was there on Saturday around dinner time, and luckily the line was small.They have a huge list of sandwiches to choose from. Not all of them are listed on the board in the restaurant, so I suggest checking out their website for the full list. Prices run on the expensive side, but the sandwiches are big and dense, so they're good for 2 meals and definitely worth it. If you want cheap, bland sandwiches, you should stick to Subway.My partner and I had the Super Mario (meatballs and mozzarella sticks), Paul Reubens (pastrami), and Spiffy Tiffy (chicken pesto). All were delicious, and they also included a free lollipop with each sandwich. Also of note is that if you pay with cash, you also get a free water or soda. Oh, and their bread is also very good. You can't have a SF sandwich without trying Dutch Crunch bread. I look forward to going back and trying a new sandwich.
Getting an Ike's Place sandwich means that you're set for 2 meals out of the day. At least...that's how it was for me! The portion is HUGE! I was only able to eat half. So for the price (which I thought was pricey for a sandwich), I suppose it is justifiable :P. I got the "Zivity" sandwich on Dutch crunch - which was one of the random sandwich postings along the walls. There are lots of these, so watch out for them! I initially thought that the menu was just the ones listed above the cashiers', but oh NOOOO. They have hundreds... The Zivity has the halal chicken, salami, lettuce & tomato (you can opt out of this if you want)... I forget what else it has, but it was delicious! The only thing I wish it had more of was salami. I almost forget that my sandwich was supposed to have salami - that's how little of it there was :(. That made me sad, since I mainly ordered the Zivity because I love salami. But the overall sandwich was so good that I didn't miss the salami all that much anyways! Also, the Dutch crunch bread is so GOOD! I think I could eat a loaf of that on its own... The bread is just as important as what's inside a sandwich!
Good sandwiches, good prices for the size. Comes with great chip offerings! I really liked their dirty sauce, I think that's what made the sandwich itself. Also the Dutch Crunch bread was delicious! These sandwiches were definitely meant to be eaten right away because my leftovers were a cold soggy mess. Not a lot of space to sit on the inside and the bathrooms were out of order. Overall a good sandwich spot that lives up to expectations.
LOVE Ikes Place -totally worth getting fat over ha. order ahead and pick up so you don't wait in the long line. Although if you are in line sit tight it's worth the weight. ...see what I did there :) lol
Highly recommend the"Elvis Keith" one with the bread of Dutch crunch!
My cousin and I recently went to San Francisco for the weekend and the first place we went to was Ike's. She is kind of a picky eater so I trusted her decision. We go and it was kind of a hole in a wall which I don't mind at all cause I've came to the conclusion That places like this have the best food. So we proceed with our order and I loved the cool names they had. However, I'm kinda picky with my food and none of the sandwiches really seemed appetizing to me so I made my own sandwich. The worker didn't seem to happy to change my order but he did. After we got our food we had no where to sit but a bench (which I don't mind just a tip for you yelpers!)My sandwich was delicious and I would definitely come again.
I AM IN LOVE. I come here every time I'm in SF. Sandwiches are BIG, JUICY, and packed with flavor. Spiffy Tiffy: avocado, pesto, pepperjack, halal chicken, provolone. All the flavors stacked together is mouth watering. Name of the girl I'm Dating: similar to Spiffy Tiffy with avocado, chicken & etc. SO good too. You can ask for banana peppers and etc. to your sandwich at no additional cost. Just be sure to read the menu because it's listed there! I seriously dream about these sandwiches soo often. Whenever I want a tasty sandwich, I think about Ikes. Hands down the best sandwich I have ever eaten. Ikes is the one thing I am most jealous of people who live in Norcal have. BUT word on the street is Ike's is opening in LA ;)
How hard is it to make a sandwich? Break open a sandwich (which, if it's a good sandwich, it's already cut in half), and you see all the ingredients. It's not simple - lettuce, some cheese, mayonnaise, tomato, some meaty kind of thing, etc. But, it's not rocket science either.Ike's is pretty good. Some great options - I didn't go all dirty (like adding jalapeno poppers or mozza sticks), but it's great that you can. But, I've had some good sandwiches before. This is comparable, but is it all that? Okay, I had the vegan turkey, so maybe I don't know what the hell I'm talking about. But, from my experience, it was pretty good. Just not worth the hype. Kind of like everything else in San Francisco.It's a good sandwich place. I wasn't disappointed. But, I've had plenty of other sandwiches that compare favorably too.
I got to say that this place has the best sandwich in Northern California. Hands down the best sandwichI've had in San Francisco. The line to get a sandwich was pretty long though but considering the huge fan base this place has it is worth the wait. Ive had most of the sandwiches here and I loved every single one of them. I'm not usually a sandwich person but when I get a chance to come here I usually go!! a Must-stop if your visiting San Francisco.
more like 3.5/5 stars.hype killed it for me. Don't get me wrong. ike's is amazing... but after all ive heard about them... i though these sandwiches would taste awesome and cure cancer or something along those lines.i ended up getting the Matt Cain and boy, let me tell you. it was damn good, but kinda expensive. i believe it was around 12 bucks? but the thing is that, you can eat half and save the other half for dinner or a late night drunk munchie meal. at least it comes with chips.they also have their own bottle sodas! how neat is that. parking is hard to find. i ended up parking in front of a house, run to ike's (hoping i didn't get ticketed) and then running back. thank you parking fairies! :)
Ike's place gotta be one of the best sandwich places i've ever been. It's quick and most importantly, it delivers. You can never go wrong with menage a trois with dirty sauce. Always always always go for the dutch crunch rolls. The combination of the crispiness of the crunch, the juicy&tenderness of the chicken, the sweetness of the sauce and freshness of the lettuce are just spot on.
Finally, a place that lives up to their hype!I'm so sad that I won't be able to have another delicious sandwich until my next trip. I had the meatless meatball sub and the starving avo. Both were delicious! I definitely advise to always order your sandwiches on their famous crunch bread.
my gf loves this placeshe swears by it,for me though, i kinda prefer roxie's more but she definitely loves every saucy bit of your guise sandwiches.
This place is good to go once - to say you've tried it.  Boiled chicken meat is not what I prefer in my sandwich. The veggie options are better than most, but I'm sorry - the high price for an over-fancified sandwich doesn't cut it for me.  I really don't understand what all the hype is about.
Oh MY! best casual sandwich in SF. Yes. Be prepared to wait. Do not go if you are in a rush. Go with a friend you enjoy chatting or catching up with. You will have plenty of time in line!The menu is LARGE. Try anything that looks interesting! Menage a Trois is really good. My go to choice.Just walk or bus. Parking is hassle.
I have had many great experiences at Ike's. In fact, out of the dozen times I've eaten there, I've only recently had my first sandwich that was a let down. It was my go to, ugly owl. They changed the name to handsome owl, not sure why. This last time I ordered it, when I got home, I unwrapped it to find it was absolutely drenched, and soaked to the core in teriyaki sauce. Every bite resulted in a waterfall of teriyaki sauce to come pouring out the back. Again, this is the one and only time this has happened in an otherwise flawless record of good food.Pros: great food, quality ingredients, creative menu, lots of choices, friendly staff.Cons: expensive, always a long wait, tough to park
You have to be a legit place in SF if you have a long line of people waiting for a sandwich. It better be damn delicious. Ike's sandwiches is that good.
BEST SANDWICHES EVEEEEER. First timers should try the Menage a Trois : ) ooooor the Name of the Girl I'm Dating ooor the Spiffy Tiffy. : ) I recently tried the 'We're Just Friends', and that was also really yummy. With like thousands of combinations to be made, I can't help but get another combo each time I visit; I have yet to find one that WASN'T good. Definitely a no-frills place to eat - I mean, no tables!! BUT there's a park a nearby = picnic!
I'm sure there's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said, but Ike's is the best.Even with the ridiculous lines (unless you order ahead), they still get 5 stars from me. Fresh bread, fresh ingredients, diverse options, vegetarian menu that's just as good as the main menu, etc.Love Triangle on Sourdough is where it's at, in case anyone is wondering ;)
Fucking expensive!!I ordered 4 sandwiches for a total of $86. Fat bastard, kyrtonite, Mario and lex Luther. The meat was stacked up,so it was like one big patty..no flavor. 4 huge sandwiches, two bags of chips and four lollipops for $86 and they asked me if I wanted a bag to carry the food. $86.10 charged. What the FUCK!! I just spent $86 for bread. Well, the $16 tip just became $14. I charge $2 for taking the fucking bag. Next time, I'm going to subway and stack the 12 sandwiches together.
So delicious. Totally worth it. Best sub sandwiches in SF, definitely the best gluten free ones.Tip: on a busy day, call in your order so you don't have to wait in line.Gluten free notes: Yes, they can make you a sandwich on gluten free bread. They are incredibly gluten free conscious. They ask you if it is a medical issue and offer to switch to a clean cutting board and gloves. Their BBQ sauce is gluten free, too.
This is the golden standard for sandwich spots. I've actual been here a few times, but have just gotten around to reviewing it. The Dutch bread is incredible, the place is a short walk away from Dolores Park, and every single combination tastes good. You really can't mess up your order. Make a point to try the different sauces. That's their secret.
I've never been there but Yelp asks me for a review anyway. WTF?
PUMPKIN!!!- The vegetarian version of a Spiffy Tiffy. the mix of the secret sauce plus pesto and avocado will blow your mind!! Totally my new favorite sammie!
It is Ike's. I mean, c'mon. Must try at least once. Can get crowded at lunch. Can't go "sit and eat" but with the Dolores park nearby you can have a lovely picnic.
Oh yeah. This place is going to make me stop going to Subway forever.
I suffer from this first world problem of "too many choices". Ike's does not help with around 80 sandwiches on the menu.I managed to cull it down to the 20 mark by picking avocado as my key ingredient and eventually settled on "Name of Girl I'm Dating" consisting of avocado, honey mustard, pepper jack, halal chicken for the low low price of $9.99 excl. tax incl. packet of chips and lollipop.As a testament to how good the sandwich was, I was already half way through when I noticed my key ingredient was missing from the sandwich!!! It was still so amazing without the avocado that I will forgive them for stuffing up and reward them with a 5. Just please don't do it to me again because I'm sure it would taste out of this world with the avocado.
My wife and I ordered the Matt Cain to share because we weren't too hungry. Huge mistake. It was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had and was left wanting more. The next time I will not be sharing.
Best sandwich I've had in a while! The little mermaid combination was amazing. Orange zest and chicken- two thumbs up!
All hail the power of Yelp. Hail, I say. A Sydney Elite (shout out to Josh M!) heard I'd been to SF many times and asked me what my favourite Ike's sammich was. I made that 'wuh?' noise and pulled a slack mouth. After a moment's shocked silence he castigated me roundly and gave me instructions on what to do next time I was in the hood. And so I entered that dingy little store with all the slackers slacking off and shoving sambos all upside their face holes and said "Gimme the Kryptonite" and the girl smirked and high fived me and 15mins later (they were busy) handed me a heavy paper sack filled with 18 inches of nuclear fission. Bloody hell. Are this many toppings legal? Does Obama know what's happening here? How can I get this in my mouth? Such a sandwich. Beyond epic. I was starving and my 9 inches got gobbled up in no time flat oh god I just read that sentence back. Oh well. It's out there now. My one gripe? They only have their most popular items on the menu board. Meaning there's a ton of crazy sammiches that I don't know about hiding in obscura. I want to know those sammiches. I want to know them intimately. Yeah. You heard me.
Yum. I always come here for the vegan options because they're so damn flavorful. I just really love a great sandwich, and this place delivers that. This is usually my place to go with a friend before exploring the city.I will say, for what you get, it's a tad over priced. But can ya do?
I feel really bad for giving this place only 3 stars :/ I've tried the nacho girl, Tom Brady, ugly owl, and vegan Brutus. I usually went for the ugly owl though. I love that they have so many diff options for non vegetarians, vegetarians, and vegans. Just that alone wins a piece of my tiny heart. Unfortunately, I think due to the sauce, all the sandwiches I've tried tastes exactly the same. I've tried it with less sauce and trying to substitute it with other items but there's just something that masks all the other flavors in the sandwich. The people that work there are amazing though. They explain what your options are and help you narrow down some choices based on what you like since their menu is quite extensive. Def give it a try! Ill prob have to come back and try more items cause I really want to love this place
BEST sandwich place I have ever been to. I recall that my best sandwich experience was at "The Sandwich Shop", but that place comes nothing close something like Ike's Place.Luckily, the line started forming out the door for lunch after my friends and I arrived here. Pretty small shop, probably enough to hold a line and a couple of folks who want to sit by the window. Otherwise, you're better off going somewhere else to sit and eat. My friends and I decided to walk down a couple of blocks to eat at the beautiful and scenic park known as Mission Dolores Park.I ordered the "Menage a Trois" (approximately $11) and I don't even know how to begin explaining how good it was. Half of the sandwich was definitely enough to make me full for quite a while, so I saved the other half for later. There was a lot of sauce, definitely enough to make a mess, but that's the good part. The sandwich was jam-packed with flavor, and it stood out so much more than my friend's sandwich, which was the most expensive one but tasted like an ordinary sandwich in my opinion.Also, a bag of chips comes with your sandwich, and you can choose from a variety of flavors. Be warned, the sandwiches are definitely more pricey than your average sandwiches, but you get what you pay for. Quality always overpowers quantity in my eyes. Sadly, I wanted to buy a sandwich to bring one home for my sister to try (since I'm not from the SF area), but these sandwiches aren't really the best to be saved for a long period of time due to the overload of sauce.Definitely coming back here whenever I can. Never loved a sandwich as much as I did when I discovered this place for the very first time earlier today.
Yeah.  I haven't tried every sandwich. But there's basically something for everyone here. Do like I did. Start out with Home for Thanksgiving and branch out from there. WARNING there may be crack in these sandwiches as they are far too good to just that. The line might be long if you just walk up and I won't tell you its worth an hour wait but just call ahead and it's pretty painless. I usually dock for things of that nature but like I said they put crack in the sandwiches and "That sh** keeps calling me"
Fantastic sandwiches. Super fun names. Super fun owner. Simply Delicious.You can't go wrong with an Ike's Sandwich. They are jam packed with yummy goodness. Forget about being healthy for a moment though, and just savor the taste. There may be a line, but you can almost certainly be sure that the owner himself, Ike (get it?!), will be there to entertain you while you wait.
First off, the one in Danville is my center of gravity, but I've been to the one in Oakland and it's all good.I can't explain how good Ike's is or how they mix up things and it ends up being wonderful yummy goodness! This is a quarterly treat for me because they are big, on the pricey side, but well worth it. Plus, I can't eat an entire sandwich in one sitting, but you end up doing so because it's great to have it while it's hot and fresh.
Yelp brought us here with 6,000 reviews with a overall 4 1/2 stars rating. The sandwiches are very good, but the place it's self it very dirty looking and doesn't inspire a great overall experience. AND the fact you can't eat your sandwiches there brought their rating to three stars. We waited a good 20 minute to order with only four people in front of us. Most of the time the phone order guy not helping anyone. It took about 15 minutes to make our sandwiches. Total of 35 minutes. I would give a pass to a new business, but a well established business not so much. Plus side- chips and a sucker (Carmel apple) come with the sandwich which I thought was freaking awesome. Who does that!!??
I don't like people who give reviews on service alone, so this review is not just about the service. That being said, this place might (just might) be 3 or 4 stars if the service here was not absolutely atrocious.First of all, Ikes is known for this thing they call their "dirty sauce." It's some kind of butter, oil, garlic, herb sauce that they put on EVERY. SINGLE. SANDWICH. even if the dirty sauce doesn't compliment the sandwich you ordered at all.And god forbid you don't want the dirty sauce on your sandwich. I've been to Ikes at least 3 or 4 times and each time I ask for it with no dirty sauce. EVERY TIME the guy gives me a hard time, and straight up argues with me for several minutes, trying to convince me that "it's just not an Ikes sandwich without the dirty sauce." After all that fighting, 50% of the time they STILL PUT THE SAUCE ON and I have to go to the bathroom afterwords to throw up because it is so disgusting.Once, my friend ordered just grilled bread, and specifically asked for it without dirty sauce. They put it on anyways, but instead of complaining she simply started to wipe it off when she sat down. A waiter walked by and saw her and gave her lip. "Well if you didn't want the sauce, then you could have just said something." She did!Aside from the sauce being awful and the staff ranging from rude to straight up mean, the sandwiches are so mediocre that I'd rather just go to Safeway and order a sandwich from there for 3/4 of the price. I will not be going here ever again.
Literally every sandwich on the menu is delicious.Every.Single.One.Seriously, if you're having trouble deciding... just throw a dart at the menu and you'll be in good shape. Even the vegan ones.#best
If you're visiting SF, coming to Ike's Place is a must! Explosive flavors in your mouth. Sandwich size that will fill you for days (sorta..unless you're a fattie like me). Ever lasting memories that will bring a small single tear to your eyes. Is it worth it you say? Yes. Yes it is.
I actually first heard about Ike's from posts on FB. Been waiting a while to try this shop out. Believe the hype!It may be a little more than you'd expect to pay for a sandwich but this is all worth it, people! Plus you get a bag of tasty chips with every sammy--my fave is the Earthquake flavor. It is a very filling meal just eating half the sandwich and chips.Ordered We're Just Friends for moi and the Hollywood one for The Hubbs. That Halal chicken with the Dirty sauce is a divine combo. The Hubbs like his but said it could've used more meat. LOVE the Dutch Crunch.We were headed to Monterey on the way back home so you can bet I was stoked when I found out there was a location there....aaaaand already thinking about my plan of attack.
Knew Ike way back when his place in the Castro had tables INSIDE! I know! We always have to support our Aggies, but he makes it a bit easier with that dirty sauce. Make sure you don't eat breakfast before this monstrous sandwich, since it'll hold you over 'til the next day,Hipsters-galore! So bust out those AA disco pants and crop tops and head on over to Ike's Place.
I love this place! I live near here, so I come here quite often :)Though it's a bit pricey for a sandwich, it's real big & so effin' tasty.My go-to is the menage a trois because it's SWEET! And I love sweet stuff, but it's also savory and bomb. It's the sweet sauce that has me wanting to bite more.They have special sandwiches that range from like 15-20, but they're super buff and packed.*Free bag of chips & lollipop included. My fav is Voodoo which is sweet, a little spicy & has a hint of vinegar.
Once you've had an Ike's sandwich, you'll want to go there everyday in search of the high you felt from that first mouth-watering bite! The staff is super kick back and the place is very informal! No tables just window seats. There are trash, compost and recycle bins in the middle of the open area. They call your food order by your name and that's that. They have quirky sandwich names for your entertainment. Like my fave the "Mnage A Tois", the Spiffy Tiffy, or "The name of the girl I'm dating" there's tons more for any flavor cravings!BTW, They serve dirty chips with your sandwich order. "Jalapeo's my favorite choice" Nothing fancy here, just a great sandwich that I swear must be laced with some kind of drug, because I'm an addict !
Every time I visit CA we come to Ikes. Best subs anywhere. I either get We're Just Friends or Ex Girlfriend, both are great. We went at 10 thirty today..no line and very friendly people working there.
Ike's is the best sandwich shop ever. That's the only thing you really need to know. It's one of those rare places that's worth the hype. My favorites here are Hollywood's SF cheesesteak (Mushrooms, provolone, thinly sliced rib eye) and the Hot Mumma Huda (Buffalo wing sauce, halal chicken, provolone, ranch), but there are really a ton of others that are just phenomenal sandwich creations. They take great care in making the sandwiches, even as fast as they make them, and I've never been disappointed after multiple visits.Pro tip: Call ahead and avoid the line, just go directly up to the register.
Soooo good! My love had the super Mario which is a meatball sub with mozzarella sticks! Delicious! I had the mnage a trois, it was also delicious. If you want to call in to order, call about an hour in advance. The wait is slightly long but so worth it! Also, there's no place to sit. We walked to a park a couple blocks down. Overall, worth the wait and the walk! I recommend!
Hype-Infused Taste Explosion. But don't worry about the hype, just get your grub on.Hit up this spot probably after any lunch rush. Phone Orders were rolling out of here along with register orders like crazy, but the line wasn't too long.You may get lost in the list of sandwiches on the board if this is your first visit, and that's why pre-reading before your arrival is a smart choice. Of course, when you're pre-reading, you have to remember you're getting ONE sandwich if it's just you, and that means you will have to narrow down the seven choices of things that look impressively good.I ended up with the Menage a Trois on the Dutch Crunch plus avocado.It's a sweet sandwich. I mean it. There's honey in this thing, along with other sauces and a melding of flavors that makes for a sandwich that actually caused me to pick up a packet of salt & vin chips to go with it. I knew I'd need the balance.Toted this hefty lunch piece to the park and had myself a nice relaxing time on the grass with white boys playing white sports nearby and dogs frolicking about off-leash.Bring a friend. Bring an appetite. Take home a full belly.
The hype is REAL. And well deserved.Stop reading the thousands of raving reviews and head over to Ike's already. Try my absolute favorite, the kryptonite (though you can't go wrong with any of their offerings). Share it with a friend, or two, because that thing is a beast, but save the caramel apple lollipop for yourself because it's damn delicious and you're selfish like me. Grab a couple six packs of your favorite brewskis, head over to Dolores Park, and there you have the makings of an awesome day.You're welcome.
It's not necessary for me to write a second review update (three reviews total) for Ike's Place, but I feel the need to write another anyway. You don't need me to tell you how popular Ike's is. It must be one of the most reviewed (if not the top reviewed) business in San Francisco.Ike's Place has moved around the Castro district a couple times, around two years ago. They first started out in a tiny shop on 16th and Sanchez. When faced with an eviction notice, they sought temporary refuge at Lime restaurant on Market and 16th. Then finally, it seems Ike's Place has finally settled down in a larger shop on 16th and Sanchez, across the street from their old, original location. This new (and hopefully permanent) location still lacks seating, but at least it's larger than the original. There's a bench along the window and a few chairs along the wall, but no tables for patrons to comfortably enjoy their sandwiches. So, it's best to get your sandwiches to-go.I've never waited in line at Ike's because I'm an impatient person. Generally, I call my order in for pick-up and therefore bypass the line. They even keep a record of your name, contact phone number, and your past orders. And by mentioning that, I come to realize how many times I've eaten at Ike's. Oh dear.Sandwiches currently average $9 to $12 and include a bag of chips and a caramel apple lollipop. The exceptions are the three largest sandwiches (named "Kryptonite", "Lex Luther", and "Doomsday"), which are around $20 because they consist of two regular-sized sandwich orders, and they do not include chips, but still have the lollipops.Shamefully, I've tried all three of those just for kicks, but I wouldn't repurchase because they're too large with too many crazy ingredients that don't normally belong in a sandwich, such as mozzarella sticks, jalapeno poppers, or onion rings. I like my sandwiches to be a bit smaller, but still complex in flavor. All of Ike's sandwiches, whether meat or vegetarian/vegan based, are amazing! The ingredients are fresh, the bread is fresh, the sauces are flavorful. You have a plethora of flavors and textures, from salty meats and savory or sweet dressings to crispy bacon and crunchy dutch crunch bread (my favorite!). The menu is very extensive, so good luck trying to find the one sandwich you want to try for your first time. My only gripe is they advertise avocado but it looks more like mushy avocado, if not guacamole. It's a disgrace to confuse the two, especially if coming from California.Fun fact: The more commonly known name for Dutch crunch is "tiger bread".
This was literally the best sandwich I've ever had . The sauce was sooo incredibly tasty and delightful! I got the backstabber with a Dutch roll. Loved it! And totally worth the line wrapped around the building. I could barely finish half of it it was a good size :)
I'm going to say that I still love, love, love this place...but today was a sad day for me and Ike's. After going three weekends in a row in the summer, I decided to take a friend to Ike's while we were adventuring around Mission for good food. I was disappointed that their delicious chips are no longer included in the ~$9-13 sandwiches and that the walls were bare. Maybe some remodeling is about to be done around the store, but I'm just really sad about the chips ): And I'm officially knocking down a star from before because we specifically asked for dutch crunch for our Bella sandwich (which I thought was just the norm anyway), and when we got back to our hotel room to eat it, it wasn't dutch crunch at all - the sandwiches are truly great, but the dutch crunch just brings it over the top, so twas a sad day without that dutch crunch ):
Believe it or not - we dragged our luggages down 16th from the BART station on our last day in SF just to try Ike's.My boyfriend and I scanned their menu over and over and over before coming to make sure we had chosen the right sandwich. There are so many options! The place was packed, but the line was barely out the door. We ordered the sandwiches to-go, and as I sat outside with our luggages, I couldn't help but notice the constant flow of customers going in and out. He got the Nacho Boy, and I got the Menage-a-Trois. We split half-half, but goodness, I couldn't even finish my first half. I saved the rest right before boarding our plane, and it was still good! The mouth-watering flavor is undeniable, and their bread is crunchy on the outside and warm/soft on the inside. I wouldn't mind coming back next time to try their other sandwiches.Plus, you don't have to be a kid to enjoy the lollipop they give you with your order. Yum!
Best sandwich I have ever had!!!! We came to San Fran a few years ago and my friends dragged me to this place. I wasn't too happy at first seeing the line WAY outside the restaurant. I didn't want to wait over an hour for a sandwich, but I decided to be a trooper and stuck it through. BOY AM I GLAD I DID! First of all, the staff was incredible sweet and friendly. Even though they had people shouting at them they were sweet, calm, collected and helpful. The place is super small and you wouldn't think twice that it's such a popular place. We each got something different and we were all very happy with our choices. Can't wait to come here again on my next trip!
Yes I still love Ikes. Apparently, they are having one near UCLA soon. I am quite unhappy about this, but oh well. I had this for lunch today and got the SPIFFY TIFFY (pesto chicken with avocado and mushroom) = total about 10.87 with a bag of chips. I love the sandwiches here and I just called in and easily picked up my order. You got to get that DUTCH CRUNCH all day everyday. #addicted
ALL OF THE YES.Seriously everything is good, especially the sandos with pesto on them.
Amazeballs like everyone else has said. The bread is like crack to me. Too expensive but still five stars.
Definitely the best sandwiches in all of Northern California. They have a huge variety of tasty sandwiches. Love their secret sauce and Dutch crunch bread.
Simply amazing and worth the wait in line. We're from out of town and were looking for a place to grab a bite before heading back home. I'm so glad we chose Ike's. Got the Jim Rome and We're Just Friends - so delicious!
I came here with my best friends when we went to SF for a roadtrip. There was a line but it went by pretty fast. I think I ordered the Matt Cain, but no matter all the sandwiches I tasted were SO GOOD. I especially like the sauces they put in the sandwiches...they also give you a bag of yummyyy potato chips (your choice of flavor!)The sandwich is really big btw so prepare... theres also no where to sit and eat in the sandwich shop but no matter chuz we just took ours back to the hotel! (:
We saw all the reviews for this place and had to stop in. There is no place to sit down inside so my wife and I had are sandwiches in the car outside. One bite and I turned to her and said- "wow, this is amazing."About 7 minutes latter we realized that we had been sitting in complete silence just eating. Yes, Ike's is that good!This is one of the best sandwiches I have eaten in my life. BELIEVE THE HYPE!
LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!! We were in town visiting and we HAD to try it... must say BY far the BEST Sandwich I have had in a long time... tried the Menage A Trois very rich and filling..Go before noon to avoid long linesNo place to sit so you must take it to go or eat in your carget extra napkins you will need it!
First visit ever, went in about 5:15 PM.......seriously, why do so many food service places drop the ball on service when it isn't a rush time.....I watched the sandwich maker make the sammy ahead of mine, make mine, make the four others after mine, they all get theirs and leave, I'm seriously wanting to get vocal, but who would have given a shit? the overweight chick in the too tight too short dress who had to hold her dress down while she sat on the milk crate to stock sodas? she hasnt caught on yet that big bootays make a dress ride up in back, I guess, so the display...t'aint what I want to see in a food place...down time and the importance of STILL top service to customers probably over the top of her head, the sodas have all night to chill, you have one chance on a first visit to paint the picture someone remembers when thinking about where to go.....the guy who took my order? I WISH he HAD presented as stoned instead of just as a dipshit twit who kept flitting in and out of the back..oh, wait!! is that a SANDWICH FOR A CUSTOMER THERE???? Why on Earth would I notice that while I'm gossiping with other staff about anything else....because I can cut a stoner some slack if they're pleasant..which he was, but unaware of what was going on......THE sandwich was a dream..after the maker pointed out that it was there and I had been waiting...whole wheat bread the wasabi mayo the teriyakithe chicken.....the cheese...it was a very very tasty tasty treatThe IBC root beer was icy coldthe chips..ehhh, chipssandwich sold me, i'll go back there to try more choices because it was a very very good sandwichwish i could give 5, but owners/managers can be unaware of what happens when they aren't there...so telling them in a review is a way of doing that without putting an in person spotlight on it......I am actually going to go at lunch tomorrow, but early.....the in line experience here is not something I would subject myself to..
Tasty turkey sammich! Also my gf loved her pastrami sammich and the service will ensure we visit another Ike's closer to where we live!
As a vegetarian that does not eat soy I had one option: the portobello sandwich. That was enough to win me over. The mushrooms were thinly sliced, the sauce delicious, the bread thick and hearty. Plus they make a huge sandwich that left me feeling very full. Not sure why they don't have tables but somehow it makes sense.
This was my second time at Ike's place, since I'm from LA. Man, how I wish they had one in SoCal.. If you like chicken, try the mnage a trois! If you like roast beef, go with the Matt Cain!Ike's bottled cola tastes like those haribo gummy colas. And then take your sandwich to mission Dolores where you're bound to see some interesting things while eating your sandwich. (A woman decided to take a piss on the grass behind us..) This time, the cashier was a little rude, but that's fine, he must've had a bad day. :/
This review is catered to those who are waiting in line at Ike's and having a minor anxiety attack over too many delicious options and not knowing what to get as the line dwindles down and the attention is all on you. Here's to you, I know how you feel. Try the Matt Cain (A+ godfather sauce) or Menage A Trois for a sweeter, definitely stickier sandwich. Also seemingly popular is [Name of the Girl I'm Dating]. Choose the Dutch Crunch bread. I have a special place in my heart for Zapp's Voodoo chips and you should make way for it too. Grab a drink and walk it over to Dolores Park. Enjoy it on a bench but beware of hungry unterrified pigeons.
Ike's has some of the best sandwiches ever.My wife and I split the "Going Home For Thanksgiving" (Turkey, Cranberry Sauce, Sriracha, Havarti) and the "Super Mario" (Meatballs and Mozzarella Sticks (!)), both on Dutch Crunch. These are some of the most satisfying sandwiches I have ever had, yet I was still overjoyed to see that my wife could not finish either of her halves, and I was more than happy to help her out.Since I'm obsessed with food and had a lot of time on my hands, I was fortunate enough to know about the massive menu and the insane number of sandwiches they offer by doing some research ahead of time. They have a menu in the shop that only lists a tiny fraction of the sandwiches they have available. I'm glad I asked if they could accomodate items not on the menu, as the Super Mario was not on the menu that day, and sure enough they happily made it for me.Each sandwich comes with chips too - get the Zappo Voodoo Kettle Chips, they were delicious and a little different than most of the other ordinary options. People complain about the price, but it's worth it. When I went last week, it was pretty amusing watching an entire crew of Asians all sharing one Kryptonite sandwich (the one Adam Richman ate on Man vs. Food) (I'm not actually sure if they ever attempted eating it, but they sure did get a lot of pictures of it. I would guess though that the 5 of them couldn't make it through more than half of that sandwich though).Also there is not really any seating, so if you can bear waiting 5 minutes before ripping into your glorious sandwich, I would walk over to nearby Dolores park to enjoy it in a nice setting.My only regret is that I just ate at Tartine and was about to go to Bi-Rite for ice cream, and didn't have enough room to try the Kryptonite or Lex Luthor or at least one or two other sandwiches before leaving the city. I would love to go back just to try some more of their creative sandwich combinations.
Don't really do review. I only read Yelp sometimes to make decision. Had a horrible experience at this place on a Tuesday at 11am. Cashier spent 15 mins on the phone with someone before taking my order. No on was in line. Took 30 minutes to get my order ready and gave me the wrong order. What I'm really disgusted was the customer service. By this time I was just too upset to eat. I demanded my refund and left. I don't care how good your sandwiches are, but will never eat here again. This is my second time at Ike's.
Best sandwich. I wish I was back in sf so I can try them all! We visited for a wedding and everyone told us we had to come here. We got to the shop 15 min before closing and was relieved to find a short line. Everyone was warning us that the wait could be upwards to 45min. We got the avocado veggie sand and shared it. Holy hell. It was so efffing good. I felt a little bad at first cause I thought bf would want to get a meat something but he kept saying how it was the best sandwich he's ever had. The sauce was delicious. Everything was delicious. I wanna go back and try all of them. It's really that good. Whenever I visit sf I'll be stopping by here for sure.
Went to Ike's for the first time today and was pleased to discover one of the most flavorful, uniquely dressed sandwiches I've had. I really like the local feel from their expansive menu. The ingredients are delicious but can be messy soaker sure you are sitting down and not eating on the run. Two things keeping me from 5 stars: 1) the price- $12+ for a fast-casual sandwich is pretty steep. 2) the wait- even post lunch rush, calling in a sandwich for pick up is 20 minutes. Busy for a reason- delicious!
This is the only place that has induced sudden sandwich cravings, dreams of better sandwich days and a desire to move to SF (because the traffic is horrible and finding parking is rare like capturing a Mew 2) so yes 5 stars because I can't give 6.
First timer here! Had the spiffy tiffy. It was so good. I demolished it in a matter of seconds. Definitely be back when I'm in town
So I wrote my first review for Ike's back in 2013, and since then we have been making bi-weekly pilgrimages all the way across town (on the bus) for Ike's. Therefore I am making this review based on A LOT of experience with Ike's Place on 16th.Recently there have been some not-so-great changes:they have raised their prices (by a dollar or more per sandwich), gotten rid of the free chips, and will only give you candy treats if you ask for it. With the price increase, they changed their hours so that they are open past 4pm 4 days a week-only two of those days being weekdays.Not so convenient if you work 9-5 :( .Additionally, the sandwiches have become smaller, and the quality has become very inconsistent, especially over the last 4 months. The customer service has also become spotty. There is constant confusion over which line to stand in for "pick up". I have waited patiently for 10 minutes in the "pick up" line, only to be told to wait in the other "order" line, even after I had called in the order. And this is after watching a number of walk in and get served before me-from the "order" line.As others have pointed out, the wait can be crazy, even when pre-ordering. Ike's, we beg of you: don't let the fame go to your head! We miss those reasonably priced, consistently delicious sandwiches that we could grab any day of the week at 6pm!
Great spot to get a really great sandwich! Love the menu items and all the options they have.
Read the other reviews. They've sumed it up for me. VERY VERY MEMORABLE experience to say the least. Well worth the trek across San Fran to get our sandwich on!
Best sandwich place I've been to in a long time. So glad I found this place. The #1 is an explosion of flavor. Went back the next day to get the same sandwich!
Tastiest sandwiches ever. Though they did my order wrong (ordered their turkey avocado sandwich and it had bacon instead of avocado on it, but still...tasted amazing). Get the dutch crunch bread!
Sigh. How to begin this...I first had Ike's 2-3 years ago, and thought they were alright but not all that interesting, so I never went back.Fast forward to now - the other day I had a sandwich craving, and instead of going to Deli Board, I decided to give Ike's another shot. I got a Matt Cain on dutch crunch, with lettuce/tomato/onion/banana peppers. They had no tomatoes, but whatever, that's forgivable.It was just okay. I spent the entire time eating the sandwich ($12) thinking that I could've just gone to Deli Board and had a sandwich that was just _better in every way_ for $2 more.Do yourself a favor - if you want a truly excellent sandwich, go to Deli Board.
Hands down one of the best sandwiches I've ever had! I had heard so many good things about this place, my friend and I had to try this place out on our SF vacation. We waited about 35 minutes in line, which wasn't too bad b/c it gave us time to read the extensive yelp reviews and view the pics!After going back and forth between choices (b/c they all sounded great), we got:1) menage a trios -- halal chicken, honey, honey mustard, BBQ sauce, pepper jack, Swiss, and cheddar cheeses for $11.11.2) spiffy tiffy -- halal chicken breast, mushrooms, avocado, pesto, provolone, and pepper jack cheeses for $9.99.I personally enjoyed the spiffy tiffy more, probably b/c of the avocado and pesto, which are 2 of my most favorite things.Each sandwich comes with a bag of Voodoo chips and a caramel apple pop -- now that's a great way to end the meal :)Make sure to get your sandwich on the Dutch Crunch bread - delish! This will be a must-stop for me every time I come up to the beautiful city of SF! I wish there was an Ike's near the LA area :)
Holy crap, SF... I need to move here for all the delicious food you have. This was my first time trying the original Ikes -- cannot believe how many reviews and the high ratings. Actually, I CAN believe it.Ike's sandwiches are seriously like having a party in your mouth. I'm already in love with the RWC Ike's, but this Ike's TOPPED that even more. The service was great, though we had to wait a little longer because there was a British couple in front of us who needed some explaining of how Ike's worked, but that's alright. We got a kick out of seeing awesome/patient service. They also give you a bag of chips with your sandwich (try the voodoo chips, bomb). I usually get the Madison Bumgardner, but I thought I would try the Menage a Trois since they said it was one of their more popular sandwiches. Dutch crunch bread is THE way to go. Sandwich was so freaking delicious, I'm kind of drooling just thinking about it.There's no tables or anything, so you can sit at the chairs they have lined up on the wall or at the bench. Ain't a problem for phenomenal food. Surprisingly we didn't have to wait in line that much, but that's probably because we went on a Sunday morning (around 11?) so it was probably right before the lunch rush.DEFINITELY DEFINITELY DEFINITELY MUST GET IN SF. You'd be a fool for skipping out on Ike's.
It took me a shamefully long time to try Ike's, but I finally experienced the renowned San Francisco legend today. As a sandwich aficionado, my verdict is that Ike's is generally wonderful. With fresh bread, delicious "dirty sauce" (housemade aioli), and a unique twist on traditional flavor pairings, it makes the cut on my top 3 favorite delis in the city. I had the SF Giants--turkey, avocado, bacon, swiss, and mushrooms on dutch. My friends and I toted our toasty subs to nearby Dolores Park, curating the perfect picnic. But my favorite part of the Ike's experience was simply soaking up the exuberant energy bouncing off of the walls of the shop. The boxy store is essentially made up of people standing in line awaiting their glorious picks, but the buzzing, genuine excitement, huge smiles, and echoing laughter make you feel like a part of a San Francisco tradition every resident should treat themselves to.
Total Miss!! bread was very soggy and meat and mushrooms lacked flavor. There is also NO SEATING!
Sad to see that there is no seating area. As a first time visitor this made me sad. You will have to take your meal to go
Nothing compares to and Ike's sandwich. Each and every sandwich is handmade with love, and you can tell by the taste. I always try a new sandwich, and I am never disappointed. Best sandwich shop in SF!
There are not letters big enough to express the YUM I felt when I took the first bite of this sandwich! I ate the WHOLE big sandwich by myself because it was too good to stop part way through! I am so sad that there is not a location in las vegas! I had been told by someone to eat there and when we first walked by the location I was thinking to myself (because my husband gets so annoyed by my pickyness) "I don't want to eat here". But I did, because I had been the one who had originally suggested it, based on a friends referral. I was sure that I was not going to like the food. So I was shocked when I bit into the sandwich and it was heavenly! I had the spiffy tiffy and it was SOOOOOOOOOOOOO good! The place is so basic and there is really no where to sit to eat comfortably, but it was soooo good, who cares!
This place is crakkn! Friscos little gem that is slowly expanding. If you wanna get rid of your hunger this is the place to go! The variations of sandwiches are crazzy you can even add mozzarella sticks! Yes add mozzarella sticks in ur sandwich! My go to sandwich is the MILF lol gotta love these names though i think certain names dont stay on the menu but this one is amazing. Waiting in line is no fun so i tend to call in my order to avoid those lines
The hype over this place is definitely rightfully owned. Came here after a hike in the Presidio, drove all the way back to the east bay with the smell of my sandwich infusing my car. The post-hike hunger was making my inner godzilla stir for more once I finally took my first bite and couldn't hold in how amazingly good it all was. I cannot even describe how delicious Ike's is. You just gotta experience it all for yourself. -1 star for the terrible customer service I received when I asked for extra sauce and they said no. -1 more star for the fact that I was charged $3 for a calypso lemonade that I couldve gotten for $1.50 from a convenience market.
This place was a pain in the ass to get here from Union Square but it was well worth it for me.Line wasn't too bad. But man was this place tiny. I would hate to drive here and find parking. We got the works here with sandwiches, chips, and soda. We're in SanFran! Fatass time!Menage a Trio with mozzarella sticks and stuffed jalapenos: I can't believe my bf stuffed the crap out of this sandwich. It was too big to fit in my mouth but omg was it amazing on dutch crunch.[Name of the Girl I'm Dating] with onion rings: I loved it! Especially on dutch crunch.They have awesome chip flavors here and it totally completes the meal.I loved how they put the caramel apple pops in our bag! What a nice surprise!There is absolutely nowhere to sit and eat here! It drove us crazy! But I saw their sign saying to go to the given locations so I chose Dolores Park since I knew Bi-Rite was nearby. It was the perfect date: eating fatass sandwiches in the sun of a beautiful park. I love their sandwiches!
I have been here twice at the most (sadly) but both times I have had AMAZING sandwiches!!First time I came here was when it was just a small place with no seating with my friend. He ordered it on the phone an hour before we met up, so when we got there it was already hot and fresh and ready to eat! We got the matt caine and name of girl I'm dating on dutch crunch and oh boy.. it was like heaven in my mouth. I love their dirty sauce!! Probably what makes ikes sandwiches so good. And their bread is toasted just perfectly so that it is crunchy enough but not burnt to the bone.I recently went like two weeks ago with my sister and shared a pastrami charmed life and ooh, it was hard keeping a conversation with my sister with my mouth full. Called an hour early as usual and luckily when we got there we didn't have to wait in the long ordering line. We sat at dolores park devouring each half and after we were definitely satisfied.The prices are so-so. Ranging from $8ish-$20, you can get a pretty good damn sandwich that will fill you up. They have a really good selection of sandwiches so I'm sure you'll find one that suits you perfectly. They also give you "dirty" potato chips and a caramel apple pop which is kinda cute. Once I start working full-time.. I will have to make a point to splurge on a $20 sandwich. I'm excited to see what that is about ;)
Hall (Arabic: Hall, 'permissible') is any object or an action which is permissible to use or engage in, according to Islamic law. The term covers and designates not only food and drink as permissible according to Islamic law, but also all matters of daily life. (wikipedia)I've heard nothing but good things about this place and why its the best. You'll notice most of the items have Halal chicken in it and now you'll know what that is. I ordered a Matt Cain on dutch crunch, lettuce, tomatoes, + onion rings for a nice messy juicy sandwich that gives you an image of an infant with disaster all over his face and clothes from playing with his food. Fortunately for me my mess fell within my paper bag and I had barely enough napkins to wipe my hands and face clean of the sauce. You get a bag of chips with every sandwich too.Upon ordering you have cashiers with attitude. Good attitude that shows they know how to entertain themselves and you while working so everyone has a good time. Super friendly, kind, and helpful too. It is a bit pricey but overall its yummy in your tummy guarenteed.*if you are super hungry, I saw a $22 sandwich on the menu which includes fried chicken, chicken fried steak, bacon, and a bunch of other good stuff called the daym-namic*
Spiffy tiffy and the 3 way!!!!!yum yum yum!! They are the top 2 sandwiches they have!!
Menage a trois is heavenly! The vegan sandwiches are fantastic too. Do not miss the Dutch crunch bread! And they are super affordable.
Woot they renovated this place. Now it has some seating inside and is much more roomier. Not really a place to hang out since there aren't that many tables around. They hired more staff to crank out more sammies!  Deliciousssss.......Parking was difficult then again it's SF; parking sucks.When I came by to visit, the place was packed as usual. The clientele was more of student/hipster. Dirty chips and Manage a Trois for the win :) They have bottled soda too.
Tried 5 different sandwiches and loved all of them. #44, Robin Williams and Hot links were the best!!
Awesome place!! I would ignore the negative reviews and try it yourself!! We only waited 15 min and the sandwiches were amazing. The menu is huge so you need 10 min to figure out what you want.
Ok, so I have been to Ike's last year and thought it was amazing but didn't want to judge it one one visit. Fast forward one year later and it was so good that we came here 2 times on our lady SF vacation.lol.I was with family this time and ordered the Dam Matic challenge sandwich. It was two huge sandwiches in one! $22 for two if you actually share it is a good deal! No way I was going to finish 2 because I can barely finish even 1!What's in the Dam Matic..well fried chicken, chicken fried steak, meatballs, potato chips, BBQ sauce and I believe even tri tip. It was a lot of ingredients and I'm probably missing so,e but the taste was amazing. Best sandwich I've ever had...period!Lucky enough there was no line when we came so we got lucky. I'm going to make Ike's a tradition each year I come to visit the city!
Love Ike's sandwich. My favorite is the Mnage a Trois. All sandwiches come with chips n caramel apple pops. There is no place to eat inside, so we had to eat in the car. The line wasn't too bad when we were there around noon. Definitely get lots of napkins because things do get messy with their famous dirty secret sauce lol. Will definitely come back again whenever visiting SF in the future
I have been to multiple Ike's locations and this one is by far the worst. If you don't enjoy waiting 1+ hour for a sandwich this place isn't for you. There is no one at the cash register, no one apologizing for the delay or explaining to anyone what is happening. Employees are moving very slow and the customers around are extremely frustrated. It is unfortunate because these sandwiches are delicious. Whoever the manager is really needs to rethink employees and lack of organization.
This place is a no brainer. Just go and have the Menage A Trois BBQ, Cheddar, Halal Chicken, Honey Mustard, Pepper Jack, Real Honey, Swiss. Yes I copied that straight from their website. This sandwich is AMAZING! You can't pass it bye. Just make sure to eat it promptly as you can't sit anywhere at Ike's. If you wait too long the sandwich will get soggy. Just go and be amazed. That's all!
Came here around 2pm and there was no line at all thank god. Cashier was really friendly, we let her know it was our first time and she said no problem we can pick any sandwich we want and do any modifications as we please (THIS WAS MUSIC TO MY EARS!) That alone is 5 stars in my book for customer service. Not many places welcome modifications (trust me I would know 'cause I like to modify food like no other to make it healthy haha).I got the Spiffy Tiffy on dutch crunch and added roast beef. Added Ike's yellow bbq sauce as well and it was the shiz!!! First you pay and grab a bag of chips then wait. There isn't much seating in here, but there was a nice little bench by the window where we waited. Couple mins later one of the girls came out w/ my order in a cute brown bag. The sandwich was big enough for us to split, but after taking one bite I didn't want to share LOL. Normally I hate bread, but this bread was delicious. Nice crunch on the outside from being toasted, but soft inside (no it didn't scrape the top roof of my mouth). The sandwich was put together so perfectly and looked like they put a lot of love into making it. The halal chicken was tender and moist, surprised it wasn't dry. Roast beef was good as well and not overly salty as most deli meats usually are salty. Oh and how can I forget about the melty provolone goodness. There was also plenty of perfectly buttery smooth ripe avocado with each bite. All the flavors of the sandwich blended well and did I mention about how great the yellow bbq sauce was? Seriously you MUST try the sauce. My bf usually doesn't like bbq sauce or sweet stuff, but he really liked the yellow bbq sauce from ike's!Ike, your sandwiches are amazing please open a spot in OC!!! I seriously was about to stop by again to get a sandwich to-go before my flight back home, but we were running late :(
Menga a Trios is definitely a yum in my book - and for many others too.Comes with free bag of chips too! However, skip the jalapeno cuz over time it taste just hot instead of a yummy. Definitely a worth of $11? or $12? that I paid.Beware - sandwich is friggin huge so if it's your first time, definitely split it if possible. If you try to save the sandwich for later, it will get soggy and just become sickening.Oh super long line - prepare to wait haha
Jack White once said, "You don't know what love is, you just do what you're told." I'm pretty sure he was talking about me prior to going to Ike's. There I was looking for love in all the wrong places when Ike's was right there waiting for me. I would follow yelpers' advice and go to places with high rating and review descriptions that included, "zOMFG sooooo goooooddd!!" I guess it's the extra letters that really sells me to a place, I don't know. Most often than not I end up being greatly disappointed when I realize that it's over hyped. It was different with Ike's though, It was love at first bite. It lived up to the hype, and all the trouble of finding parking and waiting in line was worth a sandwich from Ike's. On my first visit, I got a Spiffy Tiffy which had a layer or avocado, tomato, turkey, and pesto sauce all on Dutch crunch bread. Only Guy Fieri sayings can do justice to Ike's sandwich, it's only befitting to say that an Ike's is equivalent to a "ticket to Flavortown." Boy, oh boy was it heavenly. If I was Guy, I would probably say, "Shut the Front door, this is dynamite." I tried recreating it at other sandwich establishments and at home but it lacks the magic that is Ike's. It was when I felt a longing in my taste buds to eat Ike's again, when I realized it was love. On my next visit, I got a Stephen Jenkins which had grilled tomatoes, turkey, provolone, and pesto. During this visit, My boyfriend got the Tom Brady which had avocado, mushrooms, vegan breaded chicken and special sauce. The sauce was money. Although great tasting, it was a bit of a mess to eat. We ended up with a soggy adventure. My boyfriend and I went #YOLO and got three sandwiches, because we liked it so much and wanted to extend our Ike's experience longer. We got a Spiffy Tiffy again, because it stayed intact aka not-so-soggy overnight unlike the other sandwiches. I recommend the Dutch Crunch. Both of the times I went, the sandwich came with a bag of chips and a caramel apple lollipop. The prices are very reasonable for the quality. The service was prompt. Although a line forms, one can expect the sandwiches to come out within 15 mins. If you look at the menu found on their website, it offers more selections than then one shown at the actual location. I recommend doing so in order to get a sandwich that would please your particular discerning palette. I'd gladly come again and again and go through the hassle of finding parking around the area just for Ike's. Go ahead reader, give it a try. See what all the fuzz is about. Perhaps it's not as great as reviewers like me rave about, but you're not going to know unless you try. Be warned, you might unexpectedly take a trip to Flavortown.
Yummmmmmmmyyyy sandwiches! Halal chicken? 'Nuff said. PSSpiffy Tiffy and Mnage Trois were so freaking good. So happy theres a location in Oakland cuz I cant wait for the next time.
OMG! why can't they have one of the these in Miami? yes you have to make a line....and no I'm not used to doing that....but for these sandwiches...it is totally worth it!!!! If you are in the San Fran area, please...do not leave without trying Ikes. I had the "sometimes I'm a vegetarian" and when I was done, I was seriously considering going back for another one. So many choices, so little time...
There. Are. Just. So. Many. Choices. I did it all wrong, I didn't carefully look over the menu before I went. And I didn't bring my glasses, so I wasn't ready to pull the trigger when I got up to the counter. Menage a Trois 5/5BBQ, Cheddar, Halal Chicken, Honey Mustard, Pepper Jack, Real Honey, Swiss. It was super duper rich. Not for the faint of heart. A rainy day sammie.Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian 4/5Grilled mushrooms, Marinated Artichoke Hearts, Pesto, Provolone. It was good, but I wanted more fresh veggies. I know, read the sandwich title... but hey...In the future I am looking forward to a Pilgrim with real turkey... An Al Bundy :)There isn't really anywhere to sit while you eat, except a bench or two, so be prepared to take you sammie somewhere.
Tried Ike's for the first time today and I was surprised by how good it was! I don't usually like sandwiches but got the Elvis Keith and inhaled it. The Dutch crunch bread was perfectly crunchy but soft at the same time. Lots of chicken (shredded) and veggies in it. The sauces are perfectly paired with the teriyaki chicken. Will be coming again soon!
Tried the spiffy tiffy sandwich, thought it was great! The combination of avocado and mushrooms was interesting, and the dill chips that come along with the sandwich were great. Make sure to try something from their bottles soda collection! They have everything from pecan pie to huckleberry to cherry flavored sodas.
With that many reviews and people waiting that long for a sandwich means it has to be amazing right?! Well it did not disappoint...probably the best sandwich I've had. We shared the mnage and spiffy tiffy and we loved both but hands down loved the mnage the best! Mmm just wish it wasn't such a long line every time!
After trying other Ike's locations, I have to say this is by far the best one. Is this the only location that gives free chips with your meal? The other 2 I went to don't include them :( Their chips are so good too!I got the Matt Cain, Lincecum, and something else.. I really can't explain which was which cause I ate half of each. But dude. Freakin' amazing. Like every single one! Seriously the best sandwich I've every eaten- they packed all of them with so much meat, and their sauce is helllllla good too! I was one of those ppl that thought Ike's was super overrated, but not this location! There's no tables or chairs for you to stay and eat, and honestly that's probably best. The line was out the door, and there's a ton of ppl waiting for their food. It took maybe ~30 minutes to order and get my food, which isn't that bad seeing how it was packed. These sandwiches are pretty messy.. Lol idk how ppl are walking to the park and eating there cause I'd probably have sauce dripping down my arm. Or I'll drop it and cry. But anyways definitely a spot to try out! You won't regret it!
Shortly after moving to Berkeley last year, I visited one of my friends who lives in SF. It was my first time in the city, and she said I had to go try Ike's. She said that she could always tell how long employees at Ike's had been working there. She said any employee who was skinny had just started, and that a month, she would come back and see that that person had gained like 10 pounds. I'm not sure as to the veracity of her claim, but given how amazing the sandwiches taste, I'm inclined to believe it. I would gain so much weight if I had access to these sandwiches every day. I can't remember exactly what I got. I just remember that it was named after a San Francisco Giants player, and it was not on the regular menu. It had fried chicken, honey mustard, ranch, and American cheese. I got it on Dutch Crunch. Wow! This was a damn good sandwich. That was the first time I had Dutch Crunch bread, and even though I've had it at several other places since then, this place's is still the best I've had. The chicken was really tasty, and all of the vegetables were nice and fresh. These sandwiches are definitely deserving of the hype.Also, they gave me a caramel-apple lollipop with the sandwich, so that was really awesome too. If you are anywhere remotely near Ike's, you should absolutely go.
This Ike's serves the same sandwiches (and more -- if you take a look at the multiple offerings posted on their walls in the form of drawings or posters) as the one in Palo Alto. Can't go wrong with dutch crunch bread -- no matter which sandwich you choose. No seating inside, and the wait is just as long as the one at Stanford (goes around the block!) during prime meal times. Every sandwich comes with the caramel apple pop. :) Would recommend if you want a filling, food coma-inducing sandwich -- perhaps best during off-peak hours to avoid the long wait.
Huge line for sandwiches, I've had plenty of good sandwiches, but SF foodies get alittle too hardcore over the "best sandwich" places to go.If it was a more chill place, no huge line, I'd probably say its cool, but standing outside in the hot sun, then having to walk a few blocks to eat it at the park, by the time I was done, I was kind of over the place.Probably nicer for SF residents vs. the people who drive from far away.

This is my guilty pleasure spot. It's delicious and I'm yet to have a bad sandwich. Sandwiches I've had and loved:-- Jim Harbaugh: Chicken, sweet chili sauce, avocado, pepper Jack-- Don't F w/ E.K.: Chicken, teriyaki, wasabi mayo, mushrooms, Swiss.-- Jose Conseco: Turkey, bacon, Caesar, Jack.-- Mark Appel: Fried chicken, BBQ, honey mustard, real honey, cheddar, Swiss, pepper Jack. Plus the suckers are always a pleasant surprise at the bottom of your bag!
I was having a wonderful Saturday morning until I came here. The guy that took my order was trying to juggle the phones and counter service at the same time. I had purchased the 4 Groupons and I found out that this location does not accept them. I read the whole Groupon small print, terms and conditions and it did not say anything about specific locations. I waited 15-20 mins for my sandwich and my name never got called. I stood at the counter waited another 5 mins trying to get someone's attention. My sandwich and fries were sitting with the phone orders. I bet the guy that took my order put it under as a phone order since he was trying to do way too many things at once. The fries were soggy and cold when I got them. The sandwich was pretty good. I asked to speak to the manager, because I noticed they had a Groupon sticker on the front of the window. I wanted to know why they are promoting a company when they don't even accept their deals. She said they do, but not these. The music was also annoyingly loud and there's no where to sit and eat your food. I'm def not coming back here. Overall a bad experience.
Ike's sandwiches are offbeat and overstuffed, just the way I like them.
So effing disappointed. Explicitly ordered a laffy taffy spiffy tiffy piffy whatever sandwich for the first time ever today. My first time here and probably last time since I'll be leaving in a week or so. Got to Dolores park to find out I got a Menage a Trois. Ugh. So sweet (this is coming from someone that has a sweet tooth). So sad inside. So disappointed. No really. If you can't get a $13 sandwich order correct, don't know what to say. So much for popping an Ike's cherry.
This is my fav sandwich place in sf. I always get the ' hot momma huda' which is kind of a buffalo chicken. Check out the ' feeling dirty' options like adding mozerella sticks. They also have cool novelty sodas (remember jolt?). Takes a while there, call ahead and they have it ready when u get there.Also, half off for emts and paramedics in uniform!
The food I most love is here.Super staff............Great service.Highly recommended them.Will try again :)
Though the menage trois was my first, it wasnt very memorable. I probably wouldnt be dying to have one again. The sandwich was great, but it was also pretty pricey ($12). It wasnt very busy when we went, but there was no tables, only a bench and a few chairs. That made it pretty inconvient to actually sit and eat.
I am definitely a fan of the Matt Cain! Also I really enjoy their selection of drinks (I got a chuckle out of my lenninADE) and their chips.
How have I not reviewed Ike's?! Seriously, this sandwich is divine. It's tasty, it's messy, it's MASSIVE. what more do you want?!okay so i've been to ike's a lottaa times and all i get is "name of the girl I'm dating" with cheddar on a dutch crunch. I need to try more of their 30958043 concoctions, but this one is so damn good! makes my list for one of the best sandwiches I've ever had!
Best sandwiches I've ever had. I can't wait until Ike comes to LA, which he's planning on doing soon. I heard about this place from Man Vs. Food, and my wife and I were excited to try this place out. It definitely lived up to the hype and the wait in line is totally worth it.Favorites:Spiffy TiffyDamon Bruce(I've had others but I forgot their names.. Just make sure you get their special bread and extra dirty sauce, just don't wait to eat it until you get to the airport, which I've done before).
If your in the mood for a sandwich with some jazz, check out Ike's. Great for vegetarians too.
Every time I'm in SF for a weekend I make sure I eat lunch here once, if not twice. My favorite is the Going Home for Thanksgiving with avocado on a dutch crunch roll and a bag of voodoo chips. Hands down my favorite sandwich shop! NOM NOM NOM
First time going to San Fran and I made my way down to Ike's in the Castro district. My sandwich was amazing! I got the Paul Rueban with pastrami lettuce tomato and added pickles and mustard. It's kind of hidden but definitely worth the drive down. The sandwiches are huge and service is quick! I will def come back! Plus, everyone always likes a free sucker. Pay in cash and you will get a free soda too!
So many great choices, and the sandwiches couldn't get any better. Bread is superb, and everything else is just as amazing!
Heard great things about Ike's, so decided to give it a try. I walk in, line is long but not that long. Takes about twenty minutes though until I get to the front of the line. The Ike's employees had stacked boxes so high in front of the menu so I didn't really know what I wanted, but just decided to go with something that was visible. When we get to the front, the woman working the register informs me that it's a 50 minute wait for a sandwich. 50 minutes. For a sandwich. I'm not a mission hipster and actually have better things to do with my life than wait 50 minutes for a sandwich. I end up buying a Diet Pepsi and having a Vietnamese sandwich next door at Dinosaurs, which I suspect was filled with Ike's rejects like myself.
The "Chipper's Fave" is a great tuna sandwich! All of Ike's concoctions are served on Dutch crunch bread, which is soft in the middle, crusty on the outside, with an awesomely unique flavor. My sandwich came with tuna, avocado, lettuce, tomato, onions, American cheese, and "dirty secret sauce."Even though it's a pretty long wait at lunchtime, it's well worth it. Pretty large sandwich... the first half might fill you up, but you'll have the second for a late night snack (or lunch tomorrow). There's going to be one in Westwood (LA) soon too. Awesome!Tip 1: Sandwiches also come with a bag of potato chips, but most of the chips are baked in peanut oil (check the ingredients).Tip 2: There are twice as many sandwiches listed online vs. in the store. Tip 3: Order by phone and you'll save a whole bunch of time.
OH. MY. GOSH! I loved this place! For sure in my top 3 of my SF trip. I've tried Earl's of Sandwich where people hyped the place to be an orgasmic sandwich place but when I ate there, at the end of the day, it was still just a sandwich. But Ike's Place is different. I don't know what it is but I was hooked and wanted to go back for more. Got the Hollywood sandwich and it came with your choice of bag chips. I also ordered the Shirley Temple to go with my sandwich and ate it at the dog park where the Full House is located in. You can ask them for pickles, peppers, and other condiments when you order. I had them on the side. My friends didn't know that so if you didn't either, now you do. There's not really any room for you to eat at Ike's so have a venue planned out to eat your delicious sandwich elsewhere. Sandwiches were around $10. Not bad. You'll absolutely see me here next time I'm in SF.
Mostly take out.. Best sandwich ever. I did not have time to try out all the sandwiches but really like those I tried. Check at the counter for the special or popular ones.The only drawback is that is closes at 7PM which is a big bummer for me. Hence the four stars otherwise nothing like this.
I'm old-fashioned, and therefore have a hard time paying $9-12 for what to me tastes like a regular ol' sandwich. In fact, unless you like tons of vegetables on your sandwich, it's actually a less-than-regular sandwich, since the meat and cheese aren't exactly piled high (unless you'd like one of their sandwiches which runs close to $20!!!!). And since I avoid GARLIC, my sandwich was actually incredibly bland. I know that to many people who practically subsist on garlic, this makes perfect sense; After all, how can one expect to have flavor without garlic?? But trust me, there are PLENTY of ways to infuse flavor into food without it. The number one way is to have quality ingredients that are less processed, better tasting, and fresher. I have no idea how officially fresh or fabulous the quality of the items here are, but I DO know that I have enjoyed sandwiches from Safeway more...and for far less money.I suppose in the current restaurant culture in this country, where everything is treated as far more precious and special than it used to be, some self-proclaimed foodies are willing to pay up to $20 (!!!!) for a take-away sandwich. But some of us resent the high prices for something that really doesn't taste that much different than the sandwiches we pay 1/2 the price for at other places (corner groceries out in the avenues, for example).I guess I'm just not into hipster sandwiches. I wish them well as a business, but I just can't see myself going back there again.
First off, hands down best sandwhich ever!!!Place: small, not for dining in, long lines!Food: you have to try the menage a trois!! Omg, the only thing I can say is it's a beautiful tasty mess. That dutch crunch bread is awesome. For this particular sandwhich, I would say don't wait too long before eating bc it can get soggy from all the sauce.
Pretty solid sandwhiches, but IMHO not worht the wait that can add up outside their shops. Its a great spot to grab a sandwhich early or after the rush and then head to the aprk. A HUGE menu, everything is served hot and they have a special sauce.THis place is famous in the bay area and a good place to stop by. but there are better deli's
The fuss just whizzed over my head. This seems like a place that people go just because other people go. Sandwiches run the gamut from OK to good, but I've yet to have my socks knocked off.  I found the halal chicken mush pretty loathsome, with an off-balance spice plan, and too much soupy sauce binding the stringy chicken breast bits.  Sandwiches are fairly pricey, and fairly big, but not that full of fill. I will say that the staff is nice, and they're fairly efficient at cranking out sandwiches to the hungry hordes, but as sandwiches go, these are fairly uninspired. Good bread, though. I remember when Ike's was causing a stir at their little shop on 17th, and that I really liked my sandwiches then, but things seem to have changed, and not for the better.
Great sandwiches, if you're into getting watched by Big Brother. We found a sunny area at the end of a dead-end street to share our sandwich - a public, secluded spot with no thoroughfare - and were approached by an Ike's staffer who told us that a neighbor had called to complain about Ike's patrons being in "their" street.I don't know the background, reasoning, logic and rights of the neighbors in this situation. And am not going to attempt to. We were not drunk, loitering or on private property, just enjoying public space. His visit was a little jarring! Additionally, the Ike's representative said in a patronizing way that "there are much better places to eat your sandwiches." Thanks, uh...we live here and know the area! We just wanted to take advantage of a patch of sun at the end of a street. We're feelin kinda gross about the whole thing. I know you are watching out for your neighbors but we too, are neighbors and community too and were enjoying public space.
The sandwiches here are really good, but we ordered food 40 minutes in advance, they lost our order, the food came out late and they didn't give us a discount! If we weren't in a hurry it wouldn't be a big deal, but that is the point of ordering ahead...
Definitely the BEST sandwiches in San Francisco, every time I come here I wonder why its taken me so long to come back. I highly recommend the going home for Thanksgiving-turkey, cranberry sauce and sriracha on dutch crunch you can't go wrong. I would give it more stars if I could!
I ordered about 15 sandwiches for a party. They were vegan and delicious! All of my friends loved them! My favorite is Meatless Mike
Amazing sandwich! One of those quaint shops that is like the city's secrets reserved for longtime residents. Luckily for me I came with a friend who had been here before, otherwise I'd have completely missed it.
The quality is too variable, I've found. Sometimes everything is perfect and so so so good (I always order the same thing - Handsome Owl) but other times one ingredient will have been poured on like crazy, like soy sauce (or whatever it is) is pooling in the paper and everything's a soggy mess. One time the stuff just didn't seem fresh, like maybe it was just about to go bad. Because of that, and because I've known how amazing the sandwiches can be, I've edited my review. Also the floor in the kitchen is really dirty. I just try not to think about it because SANDWICH.
I haven't reviewed Ike's Place yet?! I've been here so many times, and should give it some well-deserved credit.It's a small sandwich joint located in a quiet spot of Castro's suburbia, yet is super lively at times. Such a vibrant shop, filled with lots of eclectic goodies!My favorite, go-to sandwich is the Paul Reubens (French Dressing, HomeMade Poppy Seed Coleslaw, Pastrami, Swiss). But definitely don't be afraid to try a new sandwich upon every visit, as you can't go wrong!Another plus is the caramel apple lollipop they give you with every order! Such a nostalgic feeling eating one of these...brings me back to elementary school.Their soda collection is also pretty cool! With names like Leninade, let your mind's whimsy run free, and choose a bottle!I'll definitely come back the next time I'm in the area!
Oh man, what hasn't already been said in the thousands of reviews for this place?Nothing. So I'll just give it 5 more stars to help with their shiny yelp star average.
I know this place is greatly popular, but it's not my kind of sandwich. if you like lucca's in south san francisco or roxie deli, i think you will love ike's. I like my bread to be more prominent (good enough to enjoy on its own) and with a good baked, yeasty taste and texture. Ike's breads and rolls are often pale and a bit unrisen? The meats are standard and the sandwiches relies too much on fatty, garlic power sauces--perfect for the dude watching a game on TV. i do love their voodoo chips though (again, amped with sugar and flavoring). the lines are long, so unless we order in advance or on the app, we don't go, even though we live really close to the store.i will say ike's is a master of fun and marketing though. i never say no to his birthday coupons (buy one get one free) and i wish him the best success--he works hard and keeps his segment of customers happy. much respect to him. i see him at the store often, and he loves what he does.just in case you agreed with my review, i'll try to leave some ideas of places I think offer great sandwiches (at least for me). i go to deli board on folsom, hazel's kitchen, genova deli in the east bay.
If you're ever wondering of where to stuff your face with a good ol' sandwich, you'll definitely have to pop in at Ike's Place. Not only are the different sandwiches uniquely named, they're also uniquely flavor profiled. A wonderful experience indeed!Sandwiches I've personally ordered are the Love Triangle, Nacho girl, and the Al Bundy. For all you people out there who loved the tv show, Married with Children, I think you could appreciate the sentiment of having a sammie named after the 'No Ma'am enthusiast. I know I did. Ahhh... *tucks hand under pant waistband*All kidding aside, these sandwiches are pretty legit. You go to the counter and order whichever sandwich sounds appealing and they can either add chips or a drink to your meal. Simple. They have a wide range of sandwiches that are made to please any meat lover, vegetarian, or vegan palate alike. The huge variety is an A+ in my book. They can even individualize and customize your sandwich to your liking. This means that even the pickiest of eaters are welcome!So if you're interested in a fun place to enjoy a good sandwich, most definitely give 'em a try!
Hands down the best sandwich I've ever had! Ike's Place is absolutely amazing and their menu is impressive with a HUGE variety to choose from! I ordered the Going Home for Thanksgiving with mozzarella sticks and jalapeo poppers in it. Words cannot simply describe how delicious it was! Divine? Orgasmic? Believe me I don't get that worked up over a sandwich. Definitely a must try! I wish they an Ike's in Denver... :(
This is the best sandwich in all of San Francisco... No all of California. With hundreds of sandwiches to choose from it's hard to pick one! They also come with chips and a sucker in the end. Lines are gigantic
One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Seating is super limited but why not get it to go and find yourself a nice spot in the city to eat. I had the chicken pesto sandwich and wow. Only hate half for lunch and the second half over near the wharf after some trekking around the city. The sandwich was still delicious after a few hours in my bag.
Gigantic sandwiches! Great spot to swing by before going on hike through Muir Woods. Expect long lines, but they move fast. Would visit again next time I'm in town.
Couidn't have said it better than Stephanie S., when she said "Party in my mouth". Legit party. Like not parent's basement video game party. Like Vegas star-studded free swag red carpet party. Spiffy Tiffy: best sandwich I've ever had in my life. And I've had a lot of sandwiches throughout the course of my lifetime. Voodoo chips=A+. Lemonade=A+. I actually like that this place has just a bench and a few chairs for sitting. It doesn't accommodate for people who just want to sit and chat, so it can't get insanely crowded. Order, eat, leave. I agree with Stephanie S., although it IS nice that the guy took a long (LONG) time to explain to the British couple the endless possibilities of sandwiches, chips, and drinks, towards the 5-7 minute mark, I was getting a little impatient. I'm pretty sure British people know what a sandwich is and how to order one.
So delicious!I had the "sometimes i'm a vegetarian" and it was HEAVEN.Next time i'm in San Francisco I will be make sure I make it part of my trip
The first thing I saw when we drove past Ike's was the line out the door. Second sign that this was going to be great, the first being the 1000+ reviews on yelp. We went around 2pm, ended up waiting about 20 minutes from the back of the line to sandwich in hand.I ordered the Bella which has the halal chicken, avocado, pepperjack cheese, and mustard. I don't know what they put in their dirty sauce but that stuff is terrific. I love that you get chips along with your sandwich because if you're hungry when you walk in, and you can smell the deliciousness that's about to happen, you're going to want something to munch on while you wait.I wish they had a better place to eat your sandwich, but I also understand why they don't. Pack a blanket for a picnic or just bring it home to eat. Will definitely go again.
Although a change in location a block from where I remembered it used to be, it's still the same. awesome sandwiches that fill you up. for what it costs, they give you a lot of food. start with a bag of kettle style chips, enjoy a huge sandwich, then finish off with a caramel apple lollipop. lots of napkins to go with the sandwich too.dutch crutch is the way to go. dirty sauce is wicked. sandwiches are piled and generous. Ike's cool!
I first tried this place when I visited SF in March. My friend told me I had to try it. When I came to the city again in September, it was one of the first places I went to.The sandwiches are delicious, and they're also huge! I like the Spiffy Tiffy and We're Just Friends.There is a long wait, though. The line is usually to the door and once you order, you wait for the food in a small area with lots of people. If you have the time, it's worth the wait.
Without a doubt, the best sandwiches in San Francisco.Check out their menu on their site just to see how insane their selection is. They have so many unique sandwiches and while I haven't tried most of them yet, I'm sure they're all mindblowingly good. Since their sandwiches vary so much, they range in price too but I'm sure the ones of higher value deserve that cost difference.The first time I came here, I got the Matt Cain since I wanted to go for one of the under-$10 sandwiches, plus it was during the Giants playoff run so it seemed appropriate. Usually the sandwiches I get from other places are small enough that I can finish in one lunch break, but the sandwiches here are just so packed that I can't finish them despite how delicious they are. Some day I'll be brave enough to attempt the Kryptonite.The wait is (usually) understandably very long. A coworker suggested just calling in and picking up your sandwich later. But even if you show up and there's a 30 minute wait in front of you, the sandwich you get is worth it all.
Our office loves this place! The Lincecum is my favorite. Tons of selections though. Best sandwiches ever...
I have been a long time customer to ikes and I have watched the decline in service and quality to the point in which I do not intend to return. I have watched prices raise and the switch to cash only and meanwhile have only felt more and more abused as a patron. I have been left on hold with one call ahead for 30 minutes before I hung up. And today I ordered a sandwich that normally comes with siracha, when the employee asked if I wanted anything else I requested extra siracha and was told they do not have any, which I would not have been informed about if I had not said anything and would have been ultimately disappointed as that is the only reason I enjoy the otherwise bland sandwhich. It's frustrating to watch a place you once enjoyed deteriorate so much.
There is nothing but truth in the 4208 reviews (and now this one!) that state how amazingly delicious Ike's sandwiches are. At first I thought, "I don't get it! They can't be THAT good! *rolls eyes*" but once I finally had a chance to get over there and try one of their sandwiches, my doubts were silenced.I knew the lines would be long, so I made it a point to get to Ike's at an off time and luckily for me, at 3:30 on a Wednesday afternoon, there was hardly anyone there. I did some research ahead of time and had already decided on the "Barry Zito" ($8.98) - turkey, havarti, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and dirty sauce, on dutch crunch - and I couldn't have made a better choice (plus luckily for Barry Zito, he got a WIN that day). The boyfriend ordered the "King Koopa" ($12.21) which has meatballs, mozzarella sticks, stuffed jalapeno poppers and marinara sauce. He loved it and completely devoured it! My sandwich was absolutely delicious - it was everything I imagined and more. All the ingredients were extremely fresh and I loved the dirty sauce! Plus, the free bag of chips and lollipop were a nice touch.Service was awesome! The guy helping us out gave us great recommendations and was really nice. Service there comes with a smile, which I always appreciate! They know they make great sandwiches and want you to have a great dining experience.So, Ike's, I totally get it now. I completely understand and am so sorry that I doubted you! This was, without a doubt, the best sandwich I have E-V-E-R had.
First time going today. Had the menage a trois. It was definitely good. Too bad there is nowhere to sit. Im gonna try this place out a few more times and try some more things on the menu.
AMAZING! GO THERE NOW, DONT EVEN READ THIS REVIEW, DONT WAIT ANYMORE, GO!!!!! lolSo I've been here quite a few times, because it is well worth the travel and toll (I come from Sacramento/Vallejo, that side of the bay bridge). I first tried it when my sister and many friends would talk about it, in addition, it was on one of those food shows (man vs food, I think). It lives up to the hype completely, in my opinion at least, we all know how everyone doesn't have the same opinion, but I love this place.Parking may be the only problem with the review, but it's not enough to bring down a star. There is no dedicated parking lot, plenty of street parking on many surrounding streets, but hey, its San Francisco, so it's not surprising, better have some scouting skills to find yourself a spot.This particular location is pretty small though (the oakland one is too), but this one doesn't really have a place to eat your sandwich. There is only a little waiting area where you'd usually eat your chips while you wait. The wait has never been as bad as I hear it is, Hardly ever is a line to order, only a line to wait for your food. But after this so called "wait", totally worth it!After being here a few times, I have only found my self to order the Matt Cain, there are plenty of combos on the menu, but after trying it once, I'm hooked. Godfather Sauce, Provolone, Roast Beef, Salami, Turkey; makes such a good combination, that I can't pull myself to order a different sandwich. The sauce is what makes it for me, no idea what makes it up, but it's delicious , chipotle sauce level for me lol! Definitely try that if you need something to choose, whether your'e a first timer or need something new to try.Cool tip that I stumbled upon:Since SF is the home of the Giants, if they are playing, whoever is pitching that night, you get a free soda according to the sandwich named after them!I can't stress enough how much I love this establishment. If you've never had this, I don't know what your'e still doing reading my review, go there now, maybe if you pm me, I'll give you a ride, so I can grab me another Matt Cain! Just don't hurt me lol!
Came here for the first time today because everyone talks aboout it so much. It definitely lives up to the hype! I ordered the Say Hey which has bacon, pastrami and swiss on dutch crunch with lettuce and tomatoe and their secret sauce. Their dutch crunch was the perfect soft:crunch ratio. They gave a lot of pastrami! Overrall, the combination of all the ingredients were perfect. If it wasn't so far I'd come more often. The only downsides are that parking might be a hassle and there's no seating. So most people just get it and go somewhere else to eat. There are like a few chairs and a bench to sit on while you eat so I guess you could eat there but the place is pretty small so you're probably better off sitting in your car.Accepts card! And comes with a bag of zappos chips and caramel apple candy! I suggest going with the voodoo(?) Flavor! Its pretty tangy and is like a mix between BBQ and salt and vinegar!
My favorite is the Menage A Trois. The sandwich is huge enough that I can eat half and save the rest for another meal. Cashiers are also generally friendly.
Great sandwich place by Dolores Park that lives up to its hype. To start things off always expect a crazy line here no matter what time of day there's always tourist or people just waiting to get a sandwich. They have a really extensive secret menu which has about 1000 sandwiches in it on top of that they have about 25 sandwiches on their menu board daily. I usually get the Matt Cain with a couple other additions which is a great sandwich and has quality meat and quality ingredients. This place really is good but I think Lou's on Geary is better in the city due to the fact that they can take their time and make a great sandwich and don't ever have to be as rushed as Ike's, at times I have gotten a subpar sandwiches at ike's due to the fact that there is just way too many people waiting for their sandwiches and they have to rush the process. If you're in the city you'll have to check this place out but there is better.
The novelty of this place is the crazy stuff they are willing to put in your sandwich. The sandwich will not be the best you've ever had, but it will be fun, and that, my friends, is the allure of this place.Who doesn't know like three different kinds of meats and multiple fried appetizers in their sandwich every once in a while? That's the key to this place, its a once in a while thing. It shouldn't be your staple sandwich place, but it should definitely be in the fun food rotation.
This place is OVERHYPED! I went in expecting a top notch sandwich and left with literally a bad taste in my mouth. It wasn't crowded, but somehow the cashiers were still in a bad mood and being unfriendly, slow and quite frankly a bit sassy. I liked the variety of the menu, but found it a little odd that the menu on the website is totally different than what is in store. Especially when I tried to order the Elvis Keith and they said they were out of teriyaki (wtf) and left to ad lib something. I got the meatball sub, and asked for it plain. Somehow that mean it came with some kind of mayo-based sauce (wtf again). Both of the sandwiches we got (Michael Jordan and Menage a Trois) were pretty soggy, and the bread although soft was clearly not that fresh. The meatballs were not homemade, and again, they were covered in marinara and some kind of mayo. I think ALL sandwiches come with some kind of mayo sauce? So beware. Needless to say, I will not be coming back.
favorite place to get sandwiches in the city (other than Subs in West Portal). Look at the menu before hand because the sandwiches listed inside are just some features. They really have hundreds of choices.
All these sandwiches and only one lifetime to sample them ? :( extreme sadness + depression.Dutch crunch bread is deliciously crusty with a cheese like flavor and high glutton content to give it that chewiness.This is the second time i have had the stiffy tiffy but this time i added bacon in hope it would bring more flavor. Unfortunately i didn't get a stiffy or a happy ending i had hoped. Something about this sandwich is just to bland.THE MATT CAIN(roast beef, salami, turkey and provolone cheeese) THOUGH is that dirty opened deli meat you keep in the back of the fridge for a week but still eat it. Get it extra dirty with mustard, red onions, and yellow banana peppers.Free chips, sweet cashiers/ long line, dirty mustacheI'll be back
The food was 10 stars but the line and wait was a -5 stars so it evened out to 5! Seriously amazing sandwiches but u just have to be prepared to wait in a long line to order and then another 30-40 to get your food. If u are in the mood it's worth it though.
Always yummy place to stop and get sandwiches especially if heading to Dolores.
Great food. A must if visiting SF.Parking is tough to find but WORTH it.
best sandwiches ever! i always stop by here when Im in sf. Gotta get the menage trois on dutch crunch bread
Probably the BEST sandwich I have ever eaten. I ordered the Menage de Trois w/ red onions, jalapenos, and banana pepper. The total was like $12, which isn't too bad. I also got a bag of sea salt chips with the order. The wait wasn't too bad about 25 minutes in total between entering and receiving the sandwich. The Menage de Trois was pretty loaded with meat, cheese and veggies, which is also a plus. It was a pretty small shop so we walked to Delores park and ate the sandwich next to the train tracks. The sandwich had a lot of flavor and the combination of meat, sauce, and veggies was perfect. The sandwich definitely satisfied my hunger. The only negative about my experience was that the water cup i asked for was only half full, which I thought was a bit interesting hahah, but overall the sandwich was great and I would definitely come back. There's also Bi-Rite Creamery close by so you should stop by there after for dessert.Oh yea, my friend added in mozzarella cheese sticks into the sandwich; however, she said she did not taste it..
I tried Lincecum. It had several meats and avocado. It was very good portion.Grab your sandwiches and go to Dolores Park! It's perfect lunch.
As someone that likes to check out where the locals eat and hates big chains when on vacations, I was referred to this place by a friend that knows SF very well.I made the short trek out form 8th and Market via the MUNI, and got there with ease. Luckily for me, I did a bit of research online before heading out. I like to be one of those that knows how and what to order before stepping into a place so I don't look like a tourist than just ask "what's good".The online menu is robust to say the least. And it's a good thing I checked, because there are choices that the menu board inside the place does not post. I had narrowed my choices down to two. I ended up ordering the The Count Of Monte Chase-o (Ham, Strawberry Preserves, Swiss, Turkey).This sandwich is amazing. I loved the sweetness from the preserves, and since it's all made to order it was just fresh, delicious and BIG. I love a good sandwich, and this place was like a Mecca for me. I wish there was more time in the schedule to go back once or twice while we were there, but alas that was not to be.It seems to me like every sandwich is a home run. I understand the Menage A Trois is one of their biggest sellers. I'll be sure to try that next time. I did take one star away for the seating situation. There is none. And maybe your supposed to grab and go, but I wanted to sit and eat, but sadly if you manage to find a spot on the inside bench, you are elbow to elbow with other people and you have to consume your food in your lap. No tables. Luckily I got there towards end of business that day and there was no line. cashier was friendly and accomidating and the entire experience left me wanting to return to try other sandwiches. A sure sign of a good experience.
Worst experience I've had at an Ike's. I'll def not be returning to this location, and since they're not very convenient, probably won't be back altogether. The girl at the front who took my order was so rude and made it seem like my requests were so hard to type into her screen. Like I was making her job so much harder by having to press a few extra buttons smh.. I wish she would've said her name! Then they made my sandwiches all wrong! $60 for four wrongly made sandwiches is just too much, and they don't even include chips anymore! Since when? I'll stick to Roxie's from here on out! Never disappointed or overcharged for those delicious sandwiches!
Wondered why this place had been reviewed soo many times, and after going I finally understood why... best.sandwhiches.ever.The sandwiches: 5/5 - my boyfriend had the matt cain while I had the hollywood (something.... haha my bad), and both on dutch crutch bread. Oh man, let me describe the experience: we both sat a table and took our first bite. We told each other that it tasted amazing, then ate in silence... that's how good of a sandwich it is. When you get the sandwiches they are so heavy that you feel like they are giving you lead. When you open the packaging you realize why it was so heavy. It's a densely packed sandwich with thick, yet evenly distributed layers of your chosen meat, veggies like lettuce, and a good portion of sauce. Even the bread we got was delicious and had a taste of its own that complimented the filling inside. I can never look at a sub the same way again. Each order comes with complimentary bag of kettle cooked chips. They are overpowering in flavor for my taste, but was a nice bonus anyways. Cost: 4.5/5 - wooo more than $10 for one of these babies, but well worth it! Service: 4/5 - there are no tables (unfortunately), but you are greeted by friendly cashiers and then they have a large empty area (with a ledge and random chairs) where you can wait for them to finish making your sandwich. Overall, it's places like these that make me wish I lived in san fran just so I can have it again and again.
I hate how much I Love these sandwiches. Seriously... I always tell myself I'm going to try something new but I find myself gravitating back to this sandwich place. Yes... it's a bit pricey and for some reason, I get extra juicy sandwiches which I regret as I walk to Dolores park with sopping wet aluminum foil and with equally sopping face due to the dribble of salivation. Mnage  trois is definitely where it's at. YUM!You always get a bag of chips so my personal goal every time is to not eat all of the chips before i get my sandwich!
Every time I'm around the area I always stop by. Usually I'm hesitant to try new things but at this sandwich spot, everything I've tried was on point Matt Caine on Dutch Crunch sittin at Delores Park. Well worth my time & money. They also throw in a free Apple Carmel pop.
Now I'm writing this review as a vegetarian.I ordered the meatless Mike and it was fabulous. That's all I'm going to write because less is more.
Oh Ike's... you have *ruined* takeout sandwiches for me, because nothing will ever taste as good as you do. Service is quick. The complimentary apple caramel lollipop was a delightful throwback to when I was a kid. Your chip selection is amazing and I have no idea where you find some of them. Your bottled soda selection is similarly rockin'. Your portion sizes are huge, so I can be a fatty two meals in a row. But, most of all, biting into an Ike's sandwich while boy-gazing at the nearby Dolores Park is an experience I'd recommend to just about anyone.Seriously. Do it. You'll thank yourself later.
Okay Okay, I don't see why anyone would give Ike's Place less than 5 stars. I have been in food heaven every time I go here and I'm not even a big sandwich person. I admit the long line, especially on the weekends, is a bit of a downer but it's all worth it at the end. They have an extensive menu on their menu board but you can find even more options online. Bottom line, you can get almost anything you've ever wanted on a sandwich here, ranging between different breads, meats, vegetables, sauces. You can even slap stuffed jalapeos peppers or onion rings on it, if you so desire.As a girl, the sandwiches are big enough that I can eat half for lunch and the other half for dinner. My favorites are the Lincecum and the Backstabber (all original names as you can tell). The Lincecum is turkey, ham, avocado and their special sauce, which I have no idea what it is but its delicious. The Backstabber is halei chicken, ceaser dressing, artichoke hearts and tomato. I recommend the Dutch crunch bread for every sandwich because it's just that good. The staff is very knowledgeable and always friendly, smiling faces and all. If you have time, I would recommend getting your sandwiches and going to Dolores Park around the corner if it is a nice day. In short, this is ones of the best sandwich places I've ever been to. The staff is super friendly, sandwiches are sizeable and delicious and they top you off with chips and a sucker. What more could you really want?Tip: You can call in you order ahead of time so you do not have to wait in the horrid line. I've never done it because I usually just stop by here if I'm in the area and craving some Mexican food but I know it's a great option.
Been here a few times in the past five years. It has become a must for seen I'm in the city. I always get vegan and vegetarian sandwiches, and I have no complaints ever. I live in small town where hillbillies think subway makes the best sandwiches. So no matter what, I still think ikes is the best reward after a nine hour drive from SoCal
Amazing sandwiches! I have taken people from different places and the verdict is always the same: The best sandwiches. There is just something about their secret sauce that makes them completely different from anything you have had before. It's also not too expensive, especially for SF. You can also go to their location in Oakland. Same great quality and less crowded.My favorite: I'll be home for Thanksgiving. My mouth is watering! lol
Delicious sandwiches. Prepare for long lines at Lunch (or, use DoorDash!).
Ike's PlaceSF: Castro1pm Wednesday 15th August 2012Four StarsWhy wouldn't I be the 4401 review on yelp? We phone in our order and 30 minutes later with were blessed with two sandwiches: Jessica rabbit on house-made Dutch Crunch Bread & Joker on Whole Wheat Bread + two bags of Chips: Sun Dried Tomato and Salt & Vinegar. We walked down church to Mission Dolores Park to eat our lunch with Pot Smokers, Dubstep Hula Hoopers, Roughneck nerf footballers, and Fighting Homeless people. The Ambiance and the sandwiches were great.
The sandwiches are good, but it shouldn't take 20 min to order, and more than 50 for a sandwich to be ready. The wait time is ridiculous.
Im a vegetarian and don't expect to get really good sandwiches anywhere. But ikes is amazing!! I had the "meatless mike" and it was just out of the world!! The staff were over friendly and that was nice. Its definitely a place to go even for vegetarians or vegans!!!!!!
Hi, my name is Channing, and I am addicted....to Ike's! ALL of the sandwiches DELICIOUS!!! They are so unique, so full of flavor, and keep you coming back for more. The staff there are always friendly and Ike, who can be found at many locations during the week, is very nice and super supportive of the communities where his shops are located. The stores are always clean and you can even download the Ike's app to order your food before you arrive. The chips are delicious and the atmosphere is always lively and fun. Not to mention, if you go in and have had a sandwich, but it is not on the menu for that particular store, they can still make it for you!Some of my favorites (well, they are all really good but my top few, in no particular order)The 49erGoing Home for ThanksgivingSF GiantsName of the Girl I am DatingHot Mamma HudaThe Dutch Crunch is the BEST, and when it is all warm, and ready to eat....ohhhhh.... nothing better!Peace, Love, and Ike's Sandwiches for life!
I've have the Pizzle, Lincecum and the Mnage Trois. All have been beyond great and I keep coming back for more of their delicious sandwiches! Bring back the Shirley Temple drink and I will be one happy chica!!
The sandwiches are still good, but the place has been dirty the last few times I've gone.Also, service is way too slow for how many employees they have.
Get on their Email mailing list and on your birthday you get a FREE sandwich with a bag of chips & lollipop!From 16th St Bart it's a long walk up 16th St, maybe 8 blocks. Best to call in your order, otherwise you'll have to wait even at 3:30pm! Who are these people not at work & eating at that time?Got The Backstabber worth $9.99 and a bag of Dirty Chips & lollipop. Ate 1/2 for dinner, other half for lunch tomorrow.Ike's is the Best! Go!
I finally went to Ike's! I never went to the original 1st location before it closed, and I was never really quite sure where the "new" location was. My friend knew, so she and I went here for an early dinner to take with us to go to stand in line at the Castro Theater for a film. I heard about the lines at Ike's, but if you go early enough or at an odd hour, you're in and out fairly quickly. First, I love that they give you chips with you sandwich choice! Second, they've got a lot of sandwich choices - I imagine the list gets longer and longer every month, every year! Plus, they've got plenty of vegan choices which is very cool. I had to go in all the way since this was my first visit to Ike's. I got the Hollywood's SF Cheesesteak (Mushrooms, Provolone, thinly sliced rib eye). I knew it would be messy and I inevitably spilled juices from it down the front of my jacket, but it was all worth it. Warm, comforting and completely fillingly great! I know where you are now, Ike's! - so I will be back! :)
After living in the bay for over 15 years, I am ashamed to say it took me so long to try Ike's! Looking back on it, I'm not sure how I survived...My boyfriend and I went together for lunch and ordered over the phone while we were driving to SF because we didn't want to wait in the store. I really recommend this for everyone! He got the Menage a Tois and I got the Matt Cain. Menage a Tois - very sweet! Even though this is the most famous sandwich of Ike's, I think the sauce was a little overpowering (even though I am normally a BBQ lover) Matt Cain - less of a unique taste (the combination of ingredients seems typical of other delis) than the Menage a Tois, but I still really enjoyed it and feel that there's just something special about it that still wouldn't be found at typical delis.I think that "something special" might be hugely attributed to the delicious dutch crunch bread, which is one of my favorite parts of the meal. It's the perfect texture and doesn't even get soggy if you decide you want to save half of your sandwich to eat a few hours later (I am guilty of that bad habit).I can't wait to come back and try the Paul Reuben and the Name of Girl I'm Dating!! Ike's is one of those places you can absolutely never get sick of because there are just so many good options for you to choose from, it's very hard to go wrong.
GAAAAAAH I got the Joker with jalapeno poppers instead of zucchini on Dutch crunch with everything in it. OMG WHAT A SANDWICH FOR REALS. And it becomes even better when you let the juices soak through! Which is actually kind of hard to do. I actually kind of like a soggy sandwich, myself.Comes with chips and a lollipop. BUT THE LINE IS SO LONG. AT A RANDOM TIME IN THE AFTERNOON. WHY.
SPIFY TIFFY (sandwich)!!!! enough said.
Why oh why are you only in SF ))): I had the "name of the girl I'm dating" on the dutch crunch aka crack toast bread.I can't even eat another sandwich again.
Forget about Subway. Eat fresh at Ike's Place! A must try if you ever visit San Francisco. We got lucky when we visited because it was raining quite hard so there was no line. A perfect chance to experience this small sandwich shop without the long wait.I ordered the Name of Girl Im Dating on Dutch Crunch. A simple sandwich that tasted fresh and clean. The sandwich was a good size while being light at the same time. The meal comes with a bag of chips and a soda. I only wish we got to eat here once more before we left. Until we meet again San Francisco!A perfect grab and go lunch spot if there isnt any wait. Just have to be lucky like us!
I definitely saved the best for last during my trip...I insisted to my friend that we HAVE to make a stop here before I head off to the airport. I ordered the menage a trios...I mean, the name alone made me curious! This sandwich had halal chicken honey, honey mustard, bbq, pepper jack, swiss, cheddar. There was the option of having chips inside the sandwich, which I opt out of since I was saving this for my flight.I do have to warn you, the sandwich can be a little messy but so worth it! I loved the texture of crunch and chewy this sandwich provided as well as the flavors. I'm still somewhat at a loss of words of how to describe it but this is the sandwich that one should savor.Also, don't leave Ike's without ordering a bag of Dirty Chips. You'll thank me later.
Try asking for no tomatoes. Try three times.Fail. Fail all three times.
I may not be a sandwich expert a la Joey Tribbiani but I do love me some happiness on two slices of carbs! I called in an order for a Name of Girl I'm Dating, Spiffy Tiffy, and Jim Rome 20 minutes before the shop closed, and was assured they'd be ready as long as I could get there before 7p. When I hung up, I realized, "Wow. There's a mouthful of a sentence I never thought I'd say." When the fam bam and I polished these babies off, I realized, "Wow. There's a mouthful of a sentence I hope I'll get to keep saying." The bread is crunchy and crispy without feeling stale, and the ingredients for whatever item you choose are a mad party in your mouth. For all of you Dodgers and A's fans, TREAD CAREFULLY. When a sandwich store has two sammies - one the "Lincecum" and the other "SF Giants," you can bet 'cho dollar that you are in a black and orange zone. Remember that you are there in the spirit of sandwiches, not in defense of the pennant.Stand up against the lousy parking to get your hands on one of the 2309684091 options available today!
Got the spiffy tiffy on the Dutch crunch. Always do Dutch crunch! It was so delicious~ anything with pesto in it here is top notch!Also their chips are delicious. Seriously need to go back here.
Ike's makes me want to eat sandwiches all the timeeee. I never thought of myself as a sandwich person either, but Ike's makes me want to be one. Honestly, I cannot remember what I ordered my first time here but I remember it having pesto and pesto is always amazing, and somehow this place makes it taste even better than it already does. My boyfriend and I just ate in silence because we were too mesmerized by the food. There's so much in one full sandwich that I only finished half and brought half home for my sister. She devoured in less than 10 minutes and loved it too. I also really like the lollipop that they give you, the interesting names for all the sandwiches, and just how much food they stuff into one sandwich. Definitely coming back for more noms.
Holy s**t! Absolutely, positively worth the hype. Gigantic, mouth-watering, mind-blowing sandwiches filled with goodness, and they even throw in a free bag of chips and a lollipop.Yes, the wait is long, but you can peruse the menu online, order ahead of time by phone, and zoom right up to the dedicated line. Even then, the place is a destination unto itself, and waiting in line is part of the fun and well worth it.Yes, the prices are high, but seriously, the sandwiches are big enough for 2, or to save for leftovers. And yes, there's no room to eat inside, but as others have mentioned, take their suggestions on nearby parks to eat, and have a nice day outside. Do some extra trekking up and down those hills to make you feel less guilty about all the calories you've just downed. ;)I lived in the Midwest for a few years and lurrrve my Jimmy John's and Potbelly's, but they've got nothing on this place. Thanks Yelpers for yet another great find!
Menage A Trois & Mat Cain are definitely my go toos. Came here the other day with my boyfriend and it wasn't that busy, surprisingly. Customer service isn't too bad, they could pop a smile every once in a while though. Nonetheless the sandwich is good. I wish the sandwich was warmer than what it was.
Loved their sandwich's. We had Captain Kirk and We're Just Friends (which are basically the same sandwich - the chicken is just a little different (shredded vs thin breaded chicken breast). Both were delicious!!Wished there was a place to sit and eat outside.
So freaking good!The Super Mario is the best sandwich ever!! Great service and great food and a free loli pop! Super cute! Go here, its worth it!
I had the Menage A Trois, which was almost dripping with honey (never a bad thing). Couldn't even finish it, it was so large and stuffed!
Best, best, best sandwiches ever....you can not convince me of anything else. I dream of them! Go there.
any sammie is good here. they are fantastic. fave - menage a trois or elvis kieth with wasabi.
Their sandwiches are superb and extremely filling! Well worth the price.I would recommend the Menage A Trois [bbq, cheddar, halal chicken, honey mustard, pepper jack, real honey, swiss] it's my favorite there. Spiffy tiffy is also tasty as well. I love that they give you a caramel apple pop to top off your meal. Nothing beats a place with an excellent sandwich and a friendly environment.
One of the best sandwiches I have ever had... Always suggest to my friends this place and they love it
What to say here that hasn't already been said. My experience was good but not great. I came here on a beautiful Fall Sunday afternoon to grab a sandwich and walk over to the park. First time here and I had heard the hype but tried to temper my expectations. I forgot the name of my sandwich but it was essentially turkey and avocado. Overall, it was good but not great. The bread was probably the biggest disappointment, though the sandwich itself was a little bland. I ordered the dutch crunch roll and it seem like it was a day or two old - it certainly wasn't fresh. The turkey and avo were plentiful but for the price, I wouldn't have expected less. I know Ike's is famous for their secret sauce, but I could barely taste it. Overall, I hate to be a downer, but given the wait in line to order and then the corresponding wait for my food post-order I was disappointed. I'm tempted to give Ike's 3 stars but I have a feeling that I'll be back soon and the next sandwich will be better (I was able to try a similar but different sandwich with honey and it was much more flavorful - though the bread was still stale.)
My goodness what a great place. David got a chicken sandwich with bacon and artichokes (the ex roommate) and I got a veggie meatball! Vegetarian meatball sandwiches are like unicorns! And my goodness!!! So good on so many levels. This place is definitely with the hype. Will definitely be going back.
terrible customer service and super slow. Will never go here again.
Bottom line...it's sandwiches, so the 'wow' factor is limited. I've never had a sandwich that blew me away, but I've had many that are good and this place is definitely one of them. I've enjoyed a Superman - huge! probably can feed a family of three. The line can get pretty long, so I suggest calling in an order if you can.
This is one of my favorite places for a good sub when I'm in the mood for shredded chicken and avocado, and find myself with the patience to wait 30-45 minutes in line. This is also one of the few places in San Francisco where the taste and quality of the food is genuinely delicious, and not due to hunger and frustration from waiting in line. Spiffy Tiffy is my go-to sandwich, but I've been pretty happy with every sandwich I've ever ordered there. I just wish they kept giving out free chips!
Ike does EVERYTHING right when it comes to running his business. He has used social media, and personal presence, to really connect with the community in ever city in which he has opened up an Ike's Place restaurant. On top of that, the sandwiches are just freaking amazing. I have tried many but I always come back to the Joe Starkey (on Ike's unique 'Dutch Crunch' bread). It's to the point where, if I order anything else, even if it's good, I'm upset I didn't get the Joe Starkey. Another of Ike's great attributes is that he hires employees with huge personalities. The customer service there is great. One of the Walnut Creek workers suggested I add bbq potato chips to my Joe Starkey sandwich to "give it a kick" and I swear that kid is a gawdamn genius! Their chips are good (not the standard Ruffles, Lays, Dorito fare), their sodas are awesome (Coke in a bottle, Sarsparilla, Cream Soda, Cheerwine, and various other flavors), and each order is accompanied by a sour apple lollipop covered in caramel. Those lollipops are so good, a recent girlfriend surprised me by contacting Tootsie and shipping me a case of them. Ike, you rock!And, yes, I would like your Giants tickets the next time you're doing a giveaway.
***WHO IS THAT FILIPINO GIRL CASHIER???? First off... I'm still in awe of that beautiful, Filipino girl who has those dark purple/brunette hair. I need to know who that girl is like yesterday! Ok now on with the review. Before I moved from Maine to SF this past June, one my good friends said if I don't go to ikes I might as well not move to SF. The key to ikes is looking at the menu online first because there is so much more to choose from than they have written on their board. Being that I just finished watching the final season of the sopranos... I had no choice other then to pick the Tony Soprano sandwich... at first glance of the sandwich... It seemed really oily... Like really oily... Good thing I'm Greek and use olive oil for shampoo, body wash, tanning and my strong belief is more oil the better! Others who are not European... Might whine about using napkins to dab on sandwich and try and dry it up... Those petty people should go back to their fake lives in Carmel as they have no business at Ikes. To touch back on that girl who stole my heart at... "how can I help you?"... I need to know who this... I can only hope that an employee, a friend of hers, or the goddess herself will read this and tell me her name. I love you mystery Filipino/Asian/Dime... And because of you I might have to find a way supplement my income to eat ikes everyday! -George ZIg:Swaggygpz
Great sandwiches! So many good choices and I like that the sandwiches have local creative names. 4 stars instead of 5 because it usually takes a long time for the service. They should staff more people at peak hours!
If I could have one last meal on Earth, a MENAGE A TROIS ON DUTCH CRUNCH WITH EVERYTHING EXCEPT MUSTARD from Ike's Place would be a serious, serious contender. This is hands down my favorite sandwich (sorry Mendocino Farms) and I always look forward to going to trips up to SF because of the belly of happiness that awaits me.I was in the area a few days ago and decided to stop by the original Ike's location (there are MANY throughout SF) so I could head over to Bi-Rite Creamery nearby afterwards. I was dreading the lines and decided to download the Ike's Place app on my phone to pre-order my sandwich... but to my dismay, the earliest pick-up time would be in an hour! I decided to just wing it and head over to the store where there was NO LINE... I ordered and received my sandwich in only 15 minutes! On a Friday night! I'm pretty sure this was a glitch in the matrix but hey, I'm not complaining.I've tried:-Menage a Trois: BBQ, Cheddar, Halal Chicken, Honey Mustard, Pepper Jack, Real Honey, Swiss-[Name of Girl I'm Dating - you literally say a girl's name]: Avocado, Cream Cheese, Cucumbers, Lettuce, Pesto, Tomato-Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian: Grilled Mushrooms, Marinated Artichoke Hearts, Pesto, ProvoloneThey're all soooooo gooood! You get a bag of chips (get the Voodoo flavor, it tastes the most similar to the Funky Fusion Dirty Chips they used to carry) and a caramel lollipop with your sandwich! Take your sandwich over to Dolores Park and enjoy homemade ice cream at Bi-Rite Creamery afterwards for the tourist trifecta! Good luck not getting that dirty sauce all over your hands!
These sandwiches are AMAZING! AND THEY'RE HUGE! If you eat like a girl, definitely split with a friend. I stuffed myself, and could only finish 3/4 of mine. Plus, each sandwich comes with a bag of chips! They have a lot of different combinations, and I've only tried the spiffy tiffy, but it was delicious! (Cuz I love anything with pesto on it...) They also give you the option of stuffing your sandwich with onion rings, jalapeno poppers, and mozzarella sticks. That feels a little excessive to me, but my friend stuffed his with all 3, and found it quite enjoyable, haha. And I highly recommend getting the DUTCH CRUNCH bread. It's both crisp and fresh, and oh so delicious! Best Dutch Crunch I've found, no joke.And it's only a short walk to Dolores Park, so grab some sandwiches and make a picnic of it!
Why 5 stars? Because there's a reason this place has over 4,000 reviews.  ---  ---  ---Ah, behold the Mecca of Yelp restaurants. You know, it's perfect, really. It's perfect that the most reviewed restaurant on Yelp is an unobtrusive hole in the wall. If I didn't know what I was looking for, I would have walked right past it.A couple of random notes:There was trash on the ground. Not gross trash, just old sandwich wrappers and napkins. It added to the charm as much as trash can do such a thing.I was surprised that there was absolutely no mention of Yelp anywhere in the place. No stickers of nothin'. Weird for a place with 4,128 reviews as of this writing.But what they did have...was one helluva sammich. I went with the Yelp recommendations and got a Menage a Trois. Unfortunately they did not have any Dutch Crunch, but my french bread was pleasing to the palette. The girl behind the counter was incredibly helpful, friendly and bubbly. She seemed to genuinely be doing what she was put on this Earth to do. I'm sure she has much wilder life aspirations than to run the register at a sandwich shop, but she coulda fooled me.The sandwich was juicy and amazing. I want to go back every time I'm in the other Bay Area.
Sooooo good! If you want a quality sandwich, this is the place to go! I went here to Ike's place as a recommendation from a friend. When my girlfriend and I walked in, we saw the in store very local and comprehensive menu chalked out on the wall behind the cash register. Everyone who we talked to was super nice and friendly, and very informative when we asked what each sandwich had to offer. I got the "name of the girl I'm dating" sandwich. It had delicious vegetables, sauce to die for, meats, and fresh bread. That's another thing. Their bread is baked fresh each morning, and served fresh with each sandwich that is hand prepared. This place is so good, and the sandwiches are totally mouth watering. I will definitely have to go back here when I'm in the city. Go to Ike's if you want an excellent sandwich!
the best vegi sandwhich in the city!Get a sancwhich to go and chill out in the park :)
Awesome sandwiches!!!!!!
I've always heard about this sammich place. I've finally tried it, and I can say that I love this place! My sammich was so good and I inhaled it. Wanted to go back and get another one, but the line was soooooo long.  My friend and I went there at 10:30 a.m. today (Sunday), there was no line. But when we passed by it again around 1 p.m., there were at least 50 people in line. Get there when it opens! I could have given it five stars, but the store clerks were too grouchy.
Can't get enough of this place. Had my birthday earlier this week and dropped in here for a free sandwich! Was asked for my ID and no more questions asked. Got the "Change" sandwich, extra dirty (always!).
Great Sandwiches. Many different flavors. Different kinds. Something for everyone!Unique.
Ike has amazing gluten free yummy sandwiches! i can't say enough about ike's place!!!!
These sandwiches are full of flavor and they really pack it! One sandwich was way too much for me to finish in one sitting, but of course I stuffed my face anyway. Beware of the sauces dripping out while you're eating, it gets really messy. I wouldn't say that this is the best sandwich I've ever had, but it's still up there for the amount they give you and their unique sandwich combos.
I've only ever had the 3 way but I've had it a million times and love it. Plus they have amazing gluten free bread!
After watching an early 49ers game, I thought it wouldn't be crazy to come here for my first ever Ike's sandwich experience at 3 PM on a Sunday, but holy cow the line was still 30 people deep. (This just shows you that there is still a healthy portion of the population with zero ambitions in life, including this guy.) Thankfully, I had ordered ahead of time using the mobile app and SKIPPED ALL THOSE PEOPLE and jumped into the 3-person pickup line. I had ordered the Change, a rib-eye sandwich with cheddar, onion rings, and BBQ sauce on dutch crunch; I took it up a notch by adding jalapeno poppers and sauteed mushrooms.Important things to know:-Do NOT add jalapeno poppers in a sandwich that already comes with cheese and dirty sauce. By the time you are halfway through your sandwich, you will be filled with disgusting regret as the sandwich contents begin to cool and congeal into a creamy mess. (This warning likely also applies to adding mozzarella sticks.) If there's ever been a sandwich that needed some sort of vinegary pickle (think banh mi-style) to cut through all the fat, this was it.-If you order ribeye, realize that it is probably pound-for-pound their most expensive cut of meat, and therefore your delusions of a mountain of pillowy beef will fade when the sandwich cross-section reveals a mere 3 thin layers of disappointment, even after they smashed the sandwich to make the meat-free zone appear smaller. Compound this with fried onion rings, fried jalapeno poppers, cheese, and sauteed mushrooms and I discovered a truly frightening grease-to-meat ratio. -The bread disintegrates. There is absolutely nothing you can do about it. Stockpile the napkins.-If you pay in cash, they will give you a free can of soda or bottle of water. Unfortunately, the app does not allow you to do this, so call in your order instead.Overall, the sandwich was still pretty tasty as I killed 1/3 of it in the time it took me to walk a single block back to my car, and the only moment of real shame came during the last 3 bites when the poppers, the cheese and the grease made the remnants pretty unpalatable...and then I ate it anyway. I look forward to trying their chicken fried steak or their Thanksgiving sandwich next time, but for now my only concern is laying down and hoping to wake up again some time in the near future.
I went here with 3 others around 4p and there was line with about 8 people ahead of us. There were 2 people working the register and the line was still going along pretty slow, but that worked out for us because we couldn't decide with all the options. I wanted to try everything because they all sound so good. After ordering our food, it took about another 15 minutes for us to get our food. A bit long for a sandwich place, but with the quality that you get, I didn't mind at all. It was sort of miserable waiting for our food (it could be because of the day), but it was extremely hot inside. It was like an oven and I think if I waited any longer, I'd have lost about 2lbs of water weight.I ended up ordering the Damon Bruce and it was amazing! It comes with these crazy chips (i got the Voodoo) and they were great as well. The sandwich was huge! I ate half for lunch and the second half for dinner. I didn't know this, but they come with a caramel apple lollipop which I loved as a kid. I was excited when i saw it.
Loved the mnage a trois!! The chicken was moist and the flavors of all the sauces were complimenting. If you are looking for a sweet sandwich I would definitely recommend it and you have to get the voodoo chips(bbq and vinegar)! Line was out the door for this place but worth it.
Best. Sandwiches. Ever. Hands down.I had the Jessica Rabbit on SF sourdough bread, and it was even better than I imagined it could ever be. Spicy buffalo sauce, ranch dressing, stuffed jalapeno poppers, vegan breaded chicken, lettuce and tomatoes. Absolutely amazing, totally worth the wait. Very tasty, but also very messy, so make sure to grab napkins. My complaints (which will never stop me from going there): there is no where to sit and eat your sandwich (but we walked to Dolores Park and ate there), and the radio was turned up so loudly I couldn't hear much of anything else. They have a small menu posted on the wall, but more selections are available to order on the menu on their website. Sandwiches aren't cheap ($8-$13), but you will not be hungry when you finish (if you can finish it!), the sandwiches are huge, and very very filling, splitting a sandwich with a friend is not a bad idea. They have gluten free bread, and lots of vegan and vegetarian selections, too. The chips are friggin amazing also.If you're in the area, go. If you're not, go. I'm not kidding, these sandwiches are the best you'll ever have.
To die for.
Good sandwiches, but I don't get the hype or price tag.
Simply the best sandwiches in the world. Every time I come home from school I have to make it here. Even the most basic sandwiches are incredible.
Close to 5000 reviews on Yelp and I have yet to step foot in this place? Shame on me!! So to change that, I decided to venture out on a longer lunch break to see what the hype was about. Tried out the Damon Bruce, included battered onion rings and rib eye..mmmm!! Also got to try Ike's Chocolate Cola, which according to the cashier, we got the very first bottle from their very first batch! The sandwiches are a little overpriced and unfortunately, there aren't any tables to dine in, but regardless I'd definitely go here again!
Technically, this should be my first review as my previous one was at their original location up and across the street (trying to help you hit the 4200 review mark).Scoring a Scoutmob promotion, I sauntered in early on Veterans' Day.After wandering into the wrong shop, I found no lines here, but there were eight or nine people already waiting for their sandwiches (at 10:15 am?!). I ordered the following:1) Matt Cain on whole wheat roll - Roast beef, turkey, and salami with godfather sauce and swiss cheese. Hearty sandwich, but hard to distinguish all the flavors.2) Elvis Kleith on dutch crunch (half - free Scoutmob promotion) - Halal chicken, teriyaki sauce, wasabi mayo, and swiss cheese. Reheated the next day, like the Matt Cain, the flavors were good, but hard to distinguish the ingredients. Like that the chicken was shredded instead of standard processed sandwich meats.Liked the newer, larger version of Ike's and loved the new t-shirt designs, tributes to the local pro teams. Yes, I'll be back; after all, I've only tried another two of their eighty-one item menu sandwiches!
Really good sandwiches but really expensive.However, the size semi makes up for the price I suppose, they are huge!
While I loathe the numerous boring sandwich shops in San Francisco, I gave this one a chance since my friends couldn't stop talking about it. And then..... I was kicked in the face. The sandwich packed a nice kick and I was instantly stunned by the glorious dirty sauce which gave me the sudden urge to rub all over my body.Ok, no, I didn't actually want to rub it on me, but Ike's sauces, sandwich naming convention, and mix of crazy sandwiches really reconstructed what I had always thought about sandwiches. A boring boxed lunch that you take to work or school? Hell no! These are definitely worth the wait, worth the price, and worth the trip.Ike's is the sandwich place to be at! You really can't go wrong with whatever you choose here. But for starters, try the "menage a trois" - one of their most loved. Extra dirty? Why not?
ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE. They need to open one around the Union City - Fremont area ASAP. Anyways, came here for lunch expecting I'd be able to eat it for here but they have no tables! turns out everyone takes it to go and eats at Dolores Park! Still, that didn't make me change my mind about how much I love this place. Get the My Ex GF ( same as Name of the Girl I'm Dating) but WITH BACON!! on dutch crunch and pair it with the Voodoo chips and you have yourself a bombtastic meal ! They do have long lines here, but it's never a problem as they move pretty quick. 10/10 DO RECOMMEND!
One of the best (if not THE BEST) sandwiches in the city. Dutch crunch bread is a must! My favorite sandwich here is the Spiffy Tiffy. Everything about this sandwich is perfect. The halal chicken is juicy, the cheese perfectly melted, the avocados are ripe, and the pesto sauce is great. you can't go wrong with Ike's!
Come to Chicago PLEASE!!!The thought of your sandwiches makes me hate that I don't live in SF. I can't even remember what I had but I day dream about it (more so when I am starving)Can't wait to be back in the Bay area just for these sandwiches
Order ahead, pick it up, enjoy Dolores Park with your awesome food.Make sure to get the Dutch crunch and the sauce!
I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said before me. I'm from LA and I could not wait to get my hands on one of these sandwiches. You know how so much hype of something usually leads to disappointment, well this was not the case withs Ike's. It lived to all my expectations and some. I got the mnage a trios, and it was one of the best sandwiches I've ever tasted. It was a chicken sandwich with lettuce, tomato, and 3 different sauces and it was all on sourdough bread. The sandwich was about $11, but worth every penny. The sandwich is fairly big, I couldn't finish it in one sitting. Also, you get a bag of chips with purchase of every order. GET THE VOODO CHIPS. They are amazing. The chips are a little salty, with a nice tangy BBQ taste. Just thinking about them makes my mouth water. There are no seats inside so either you're eating it at home, or eating on a side walk and look like a badass.
Sandwiches so good it makes you angry. And Ike? The man!
SAUCE SAUCE SAUCE! Ike's loves their sauce. Sauce be the thing in which ikes loves to deal. Their sandwiches are good, and have I mentioned that they put a lot of sauce on them?Given that they put so much sauce on their sandwiches, be aware that your sandwich will, without fail, get incredibly soggy if you do not eat it soon after purchasing. Because of this fact, immediately after you exit Ike's you should violently stuff your face full of sandwich. Don't be bothered by all those people who will watch with sheer horror as you stuff your face full of steamy, saucy, sandwich bits. They're just jealous that they don't have an Ike's sandwich like you do.If someone questions why you are behaving this way with your sandwich, don't bother explaining to them, they won't understand the saucy details of this sandwich affair because they are obviously a newbie when it comes to Ike's sandwiches. The best way you can respond to those who question you is to take a bit of the Ike's sauce, put it on your finger, and rub it all over that person's shirt as if to say, "Don't question the sauce."
Definitely a place you'll want to try on any visit to SF. Recommended by a friend who lives out here, will try to make it back before I leave town. Absolutely tasty, fresh and delicious!
Every time I come here, I can't help but wonder how his business came to fruition. I fear I'd eat here almost daily if it were close enough! The only downside is the size of the menu... There are so many options that I'm afraid to venture into new territory! I have had the Matt Cain, Mnage Trois, and of course, my current favorite, "The Girl I Used to Date" (or something along those lines), now called "Bella".Makes you wonder how the name change came about... A girl currently being dated yet again?? ;-) Anyway, the halal chicken is awesome on the sandwich, especially in combination with the pepper jack cheese, avocado, and honey mustard. However, I will request the Godfather sauce on any and every sandwich I have!! That stuff is amazing!It's hard for me to imagine that a sandwich could ever hit the top of my "favorite foods" list, but Ike's consistently does just that. Staff is also always really nice. About 2-3 years ago when I first when in (while they were still located inside of Lime), I hadn't realized it was almost closing time. Overwhelmed by the menu, the guy behind the register and the one next to him helped me pick based on some of my favorites pieces... Which is how we came to the Matt Cain. Just so happens one of those gentlemen was Ike himself.Lifer customer right here...
Ike's is the best sandwich shop you will ever go to, ever! I love how thick their sandwiches are and they're affordable for what they put in them. The sauces are great and everything is fresh. Great to eat at the near by park!
I'm not going to be able to add anything new that 6000 people before me haven't already said.So I'll just say that if you're reading this...just stop everything and GO
Ike's is in a league of its own. Yes, it's just a sandwich. At subway, they call their employees "sandwich artists." The masterful technicians at Ike'sare basically masters in the sandwich art world. The Da Vincs, Picassos, Dalis, Basquiats of the sandwich world.I had the mnage a trois on the house bread, which was so wonderfully good. My bag of chips was good too.The lines are long, don't let it discourage you, they are quite efficient and fast. Have a spot in my mind to go and eat, cause there isn't space for you to sit around there. Delores park is a pretty quick walk so I suggest there.The sandwich is large and filling, so worth very penny, and it won't be too many pennies, to get this sandwich. I didn't know this place existed, butim so glad that I now do. Man, I want one right now!
Hot mama- best sandwich I have ever had. The staff is awesome, very friendly and very quick.
A friend brought me here for the first time a while ago.... there is always a line out the door. When I first saw it I thought "Really? There is no way a sandwich is worth the wait." It. Is worth. The wait.There are so many choices, and all of them are delicious. You can get mozzarella sticks in a sandwich [WHAAAA?!] and red OR green pesto as a sauce [not to mention tons of other different tasty kinds of sauces... but I have a special place in my heart for pesto].Anything you could want to cram between two pieces of bread, this place will cram between two pieces of bread for you. and grill it to perfection. and serve it with a bag of tasty kettle-cooked potato chips sighhh.... I wish I had an Ike's sandwich right now. And yet it's so much more than loading an entire meal into a sandwich, the flavor combinations of the sandwich menu they offer are so very very delectable and layered and tasty.In short: if you love a good sandwich, go to Ike's.
Been a long time Ike's customer. In the early years, Ike's was really great for us because we wanted vegetarian sandwiches, particularly in the meat-focused Castro restaurants (no hate! just saying how it felt to us). The veggie options were dazzling!Over the years, Ike's grown and we salute their success. However, what really disappointed me is that they started charging for chips at the Castro location. Also, there is one cashier there who is rude. He's definitely a regular cashier because I have seen him there multiple times over the years.Nostalgia and familiar flavors draw me back every now and then but maybe my taste buds are more sophisticated now and my tolerance for long wait times and rude cashiers has diminished.
What is all the hype about?! I got the Damon Bruce, yuck. Something about the flavors just didn't go well together. Maybe because I added lettuce & tomato or maybe its the steak sauce. Whatever it was, my sandwich didn't taste good. My son, on the other hand, ate the Hollywood. He absolutely loved it. But its hard to go wrong with a Philly cheese steak sandwich. On the other hand, the employees were very friendly. Great customer service, below average sandwiches.
[internal dialogue, start]Did I just hoover that sandwich in less than 5mins? Psshh. Noooo. Impossible. Must've taken me at least 10mins. I mean I had to unwrap it and y'know drink sips of water in between bites and-- oh who am I kidding?! I did! I'm so ashamed. But then again... I'm not. That damn Lincecum sandwich. It kept tempting me. It called out to me. It was so dirty and I was so willing. *shakes head* WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?! Pull yourself together! You're totally fine though. You're allowed to eat them. You work out. You try to eat healthy. You're a great person. I mean no one would judge you for buying anoth-- *slaps self in the face* STOP! You're totally embarrassing. You're acting like you've never had a sandwich before. I mean it's like any other run of the mill sammie: that soft bread, the fresh slices of meat, the juicy tomato, the flavorful sauce... *drools* C'MON ABBY! Snap out of it!"Excuse ma'am? Did you want something else?"......Uuuhh......Uuuuhhhhhh......ONE MORE LINCECUM, PLEASE!Yeah, let's face it. Ike wins.[internal dialogue, end]
Pros:- Food is delicious - Lot of varietyCons:- No seating- They don't offer many drinksI came here for lunch and the line wasn't too long. I waited for maybe ten minutes? I ordered the menage a trois on dutch crunch. It was pretty amazing... Next time I'm in the city I'm most definitely coming here again.
Busy day today at work, and it was a struggle to even keep up with all the emails, and issues that needed to be resolved , So imagine my joy when I opened an email from the team leader that included a link and instructions so that each person in the group could place a lunch order from IKE's via TRYCAVIAR.COM ! It was very cool that the group took a moment to bounce sandwich options off of each other before we added our requests to the cart , for me I wanted MEAT , and found myself going straight to the Damon Bruce e ,,okay how the heck can you go wrong with , sliced rib eye, onion rings , provolone , and steak sauce on dutch crunch :)When the sandwiches arrived it was a polite frenzy as we each found our heavy paper wrapped packages , As for the Damon Bruce , it was a piece of messy heaven with a generous portion of sliced rib eye.Plus it you get a Tootsie Roll Caramel Apple Pop ! Also , check out the Zapps Voodoo Chips , (It starts off with the vinegary nose of a salt and vinegar chip before settling down with the smoky sweetness of sweet barbecue sauce. There's a sharp, fresh, jalapeo-like finish, and perhaps a touch of that Old Bay aroma that lingers after you've made it about halfway through the bag.)
When people say Ike's is bomb, THEY AIN'T LYING! Luckily, there was no line when I arrived with my friends, but the menu was overwhelming and it took me awhile to order. Seriously, one of the top sandwiches I've had so far and if I had the money to get it as often as I would, please give me more Ike's! If I'm ever in SF again, I'll be sure to stop by and say hello to another sandwich. YAS!!
My grandma and your grandmaSittin by the fireMy grandma says to your grandma"Imma set your flag on fire"Talkin bout (Say) Hey Now(Say) Hey Now"Ike"- O"Ike"- O ah nayJackomo feena ah na nayJackomo feena nay"Talkin bout Ike's", this was my second time getting a sandwich here. The first time around I ordered the Kryptonite which was just way too busy, with too many flavors going on for me to enjoy. This time here's what I ordered:Say Hey: Pastrami, bacon, cheese on dutch crunch. To me pastrami is the ultimate deli meat. Actually any cured meat that was originally created to be preserved because lack of refrigeration is great for sandwiches. (i.e. Pastrami, salami, etc). This sandwich was good, but doesn't wow me... It's not so good that if I saw the person next to me with this sandwich, I'd Jack-o-mo of his Say Hey sandwich.  Elvis Kieth: chicken with teriyaki sauce. The meat was shredded like tuna and the sweet flavor together, I just wasn't feeling it. Good thing it was free on ScoutMob, and I do appreciate the free half sandwich. But next time, no thank you.Ike's has decent sandwiches. But not good enough for me to "feen" ah na nay... Here's a clip for y'all: youtube.com/watch?v=58Jv
AMAZING Sandwiches...only downfall is they are Messy (Which can be a good thing, I guess) and the Parking (Welcome to SF). If you are looking for a great Sandwich with that Man vs. Food Quality....Check Ike's out, you will return.
Meh.Everybody loves this. I don't.It was a big sandwich for sure. They did have nice people working there. It's true. There's your two stars, Ike.The sandwich itself?I've had waaay better sandwiches in town. I would have to say the reputation far exceeds the quality of the sandwich. My review is not going to put them and out of business and I don't mean it to. I am a salmon swimming upstream against a torrent of people who's only previous experience with a sandwich was Subway or Togo's I imagine. That has to be the only conclusion.How else could you give this place 4 and 5 stars?
This place is a GEM. Great location in Oakland and super delicious sandwiches! We have always gone to the SF location and it's always worth the trip whenever we crave for the Matt Cain & the Hollywood Cheesesteak..
The good:1) incredibly tasty sandwiches2) super fresh ingredients3) can be quick if call to order aheadThe less good:1) if you're new and don't specify the toppings (dirty sauce, pickles, etc) they may omit them and leave you with a sandwich that is too bland2) $12 for a medium sized sandwich ?!?3) menu is kind of confusing -- just pick and meat and get some advice from thereHot momma is the best spicy chicken sandwich I've ever had. Really, ever, and I've had a lot of sandwiches.
Amazing sandwiches for vegans/vegetarians! Make sure to check out their online menu as it's bigger than what's on display in the store. Also, try and call ahead with your order. The line can be huge (just like the sandwiches), so if you're hungry, call on the way there and save yourself some time.
Seriously, what is not to like at Ike's. Every time we go, the decision of what to order is the worst thing to do.
Honest Review. 4stars for location & quality of ingredients used to make these delicious sandwiches.Yes, this place makes bomb sandwiches! What i wish worked out was the customer service, i had Vanessa as the one who took my order, nice but seemed a bit distracted. She seemed to get all the specifics on my order correct yet when I got the sanwiches (2) they were mixed up. I wanted certain add ons to my sandwich but wasnt there it was added on to my boyfriends. And i didnt have cheese on mine. It was already too late to go back and exchange it. But even though there was a mistake on how they made it, the sandwich still turned out pretty good. good size sandwich for avg price rage of $9-13.
Most amazing sandwich of my entire life. Doesn't look like much but I'm so glad I tried it. Thanks to Duff Goldman of charm city cakes via the show "the best thing I ever ate" suggestion. Will forever stop and grab a sandwich every time I'm in the city.
Lives up to the hype. Seriously. Amazing. I would line up for hours if I had to. Makes me think seriously about moving to San Francisco (from Australia...). Had the BLT, added shredded chicken, bloody amazing.
Do I seriously need to say more? I'm sure all 4,898 reviews cover almost every little detail about Ike's. Here's to review 4,899 and counting!Clearly, Ike's has one hell of a reputation in San Francisco. I'm normally not a big fan of sandwiches, but I've heard such good things about this place that I had to put it on bookmark and try it. Soon enough, I had my friend Mark P. take me here to hang out.This place is decked out hipster, all the cool kids are here. We came on a Thursday afternoon and there wasn't any lines or significantly long waits. Mark recommended the Going Home for Thanksgiving as a good first timer sandwich, so I went with that and added onion rings to really get things going. Your order comes with a bag of chips! Total came out to be around $12. For that price, I better get a bomb sandwich! We waited for about 5-10 minutes until an Iker walked out and gave us our orders. They got all artsy and drew a house on my sandwich for "home". Too freakin' adorable! But wait, it gets better! They even put a lollipop in your doggie bag! *tears* They know how to make you feel special!Like most people would concur, you should head over to Dolores Park and enjoy your food there because Ike's doesn't accommodate for seating. There's a beautiful view of the city just up the hill! Me and Mark make our way here to sit and eat. Ike had me under his spell at first bite. Fresh out the oven goodness. 'Nuff said. Even hours later, the sandwich still held up and tasted just as heavenly.Ike's can make one hell of a sandwich. There's lots to choose from, but you can't go wrong here. I could talk up a storm about the experience that their sandwiches deliver, but you definitely have to try it for yourself. I really want to meet Ike and rub his head. Maybe I'll have a chance the next time I'm there. I don't even know him, but I'm already truly, madly, deeply in love with him! He's genius. I've never had a greater appreciation for a sandwich until Ike's. Holla at ya boy! My complements to him and his staff!
Looong wait, totally worth it. Order online to save time, or at least look at the menu and decide what you want before you get there. They can make anything that's on the website. I always get the vegan Tom Brady on sourdough and it never fails to make my day. Big enough one big meal, or two small.
I have to say the food is top notch. and the staff there have some of the biggest hearts I have seen. keep up the awesome work
Yes it's pricey but it is filling I split the sandwich with my sister. food is amazing, highly recommend the mnage trois and I think we added fried chicken. Staff is super friendly and prompt. Free chips and lollipops with every order. (Score when you get the caramel apple ones!)Minimal seating, ordered and took our sandwiches to Dolores park which isn't to far of a walk and has a great view!
Finally another bookmarked place to cross off. I remembered to call and place my order to avoid possible long lines. Fortunately for us there was no line and our sandwich was ready when we got there. I ordered the ever-so popular Menage A Trois (halal chicken, real honey, honey mustard, bbq, pepper jack, swiss, cheddar) sandwich. I thought the sandwich was good but it did not blow me away. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but with over 300 reviews mentioning this sandwich I didn't think I could go wrong. With tons of other places I've bookmarked in the bay, don't know if I'll come back on my next trip...but maybe someday..As Seen On TV: Man v. Food - Travel Channel
Yes. These are what manly sandwiches are supposed to be like. Hole in a wall, check. Good bread, check. Huge menu with so many frickin ingredients it's so hard to decide... check. I met the owner Ike at the World Food Championships last month in Vegas, as he was competing for the title of world's best sandwich. He should've won, but these food contests are unpredictable. Anyway, I made it a point to check out Ike's Place on my next SF visit.*Thumbs up*I loved the dutch crunch bread from my "Damon Bruce" sandwich. I didn't want to get a sandwich that had too many components, so this sandwich did the trick. Thinly sliced ribeye steak, lettuce tomato, steak sauce, provolone, and onion rings were the ingredients. The bread was clearly my favorite part. Crunchy on the outside, while soft and pillowy on the inside.*Thumbs down*If I had to nitpick for the sandwich I ate, it would be that the onion rings got lost. I hardly remember tasting them. But not a big deal, as the bread with the dirty sauce provided most of the flavor. There could've been a bit more meat in my sandwich as well -- I always like a good meat to bread ratio, but I could see how that could be an even bigger issue with the other sandwiches with more ingredients.
just like most people I follow restaurants that have been on tv or have amazing yelp reviewsdid it reach my expectation? 75%yes it's good. is it amazing? ..hmm. they have Alloootttt of diff tastes so im sure u can def find a fav one if the first choice wasn't to ur looking. .... choosing out of their menu is probably the hardest thing in life! I personally got the spiffy tiffy: Avocado, halal chicken, mushrooms, pepper jack, pesto, provolone... it was good but it wasn't something I'd crave again. im a sauce person and it didn't really stick out to memy friends got the:Matt cain: Godfather sauce, provolone, roast beef, salami, turkey49er?? I can't remember or find it on menu now.. both sandwiches and sauces amazingI think what made the sandwiches even better was the bread. dutch crunch all the way. I stopped eating the spiffy tiffy when I got full but kept picking at the bread :)tried the mesquite bbq dill and the hotter n hot jalapeno chips. all weren't that great to me..but def be creative and try a sandwich~
Ike's has so many reviews, there's very little I can add. So, in as few words as possible:Not "just a sandwich shop" as I assumed before going here... it is THE sandwich shop. There is something on the menu that will not only please everyone, but make everyone tap dance with joy - and, return promptly. Carnivores, vegetarians and vegans rejoice. There is something we can all agree on.On top of all the options, customization and fun flavor twists, Ike's adds something special. Their combinations are inspirational, their staff are friendly, down-to-earth folks, and YOU GET A LOLLIPOP with your sandwich. This is the stuff favorite spots are made of.Minus one star ONLY because you close at 7. I know, you can. You can do it because people line up all day and get on waitlists for your sandwiches. People order dinner hours in advance and rush home from work to get one on time. I know because I am one of those people. But I still wish I could get another at 9. And another at 11... and 3am...
1 star for the vegan option. and 1 star for the long wait for bland flavor and no texture.i had the Vegan XXXtina (Buffalo Wing Sauce, Vegan Breaded Chicken, Vegan Cheese) the fake chicken taste like soggy bread, there wasn't any texture to it i was definitely was expecting more for an $11.11 + tax sandwich with all these high star reviews. also, they packed the middle of the sadwhich with all the filling so that it appeared like a lot, but because its over weighted, when i opened the package half of it fell on the ground, and after the first few bites there was nothing but bread and sauce at each of the ends.
I've been coming here for years!!! but i've recently started yelping reviews. I went here the first time when the line started outside the door and there was outdoor seating, but sadly they got closed down, then moved under lime then finally found a bigger place!!!! I was so excited and waited anxiously. I usually get the "name of the ex-girlfriend" or #8 the bbq one!. When i'm not coming to this one I'm at the one at redwood city or cupertino!! Open one in San Diego :D
SPIFFY TIFFY on dutch crunchMmm yummy halal chicken has a unique flavor (shredded chicken mixed with schtufff ) combined with avocados AND PESTO etc. even with a long line , it goes by pretty fast. GET IT wont regret. Ps: HUGE
Wet sandwiches. Yum!!
Much like other popular spots in the city, this place is known more for being an amazing place to get a sandwich, than actually serving amazing sandwiches.It follows in the line of hype & little payoff, like Taqueria Cancun, or Burma Superstar.I'd be willing to bet the ratio of folks that love this place is much higher outside of the city, than those that actually live within its borders. Now, I know, elitist San Franciscan, blah, blah, yada. But here's some fair opinion to try and offset the bias you would expect from a city-snob such as myself...My three favorite sandwich shops:1. Lou's (SF)2. Little Lucca (South City)3. Darby Dan's (South City)See? Of my top choices, only one is in the city. I'm fair. And I'm right...cause I live in San Francisco. Joke people, these are the jokes!
Might be the best sandwich spot I've been to. This place is awesome. Portions are huge No doubt the best sandwiches in the city. The line is usually out the door so better phone in your order. Bella sandwich is to die for.
I can't wait to go back to San Fransisco to try another of Ike's sandwiches! I got the Peg Bundy on Dutch crunch bread it had breaded eggplant, gouda, and tons of avocado and the dirty secret sauce! Everything was so flavorful and complimentary and with that bread! I heard it can get busy so I called ahead and I picked up my sandwich and ate it at dolores park. Very yummy! Must try in the bay! Pretty close to Bi-rite, too so you can hit it up at the same time.
It's funny. I've tried a good share of Ike's sandwiches, but after all this time I've never been to the original Ike's Place and probably never will since it closed down and their new location in the Castro is across the street from their original spot. And that's fine, since the new location is more roomy to accommodate their long lines, but still not enough room for table seating like at the new Ike's Lair in downtown Redwood City.I dropped by on a Sunday at around noon expecting the usual long line out the door and around the block, but when I got there I was totally surprised to see that there was no line outside whatsoever. I guess I either got lucky or not a lot of people know that they reopened at a new spot in the Castro. The line was very short and it basically took about 15 mins to get my sandwich from waiting in line to picking up my sandwich.What sandwich did I pick up this time? Since it won the ESPN National Fanwich Trophy, I picked up the Matt Cain World Championship Edition. It's essentially the Matt Cain which has Roast beef, Turkey, Salami, Godfather Sauce, and Provolone, and then UPGRADED with Beer-Battered Mozzarella sticks, Onion Rings, Avocado, and Ike's Dirty Secret Sauce. And as you can see here (yelp.com/user_local_phot), IT'S A WINNER!!! Though a little pricey at $14, it was very tasty, and worthy of it's Fanwich trophy! I would order another one and probably will next time.So now that I finally visited Ike's Place in the city, would I go back again knowing that there are other locations closer to me? I still would if I was around the area. The crew at this location was very knowledgeable and had a great attitude, plus they give out Free Chips with any sandwich order!! Best Sandwiches in the Bay Area!! 5 STARS BABY!!
This may be one of the best sandwich spots I've ever been to. I ordered the mnage a trois and it was delicious. The dirty sauce was what made it so good! I got it on the French bread because they were out of the Dutch crunch and it was still amazing. The halal chicken was so juicy and tender and everything was delicious. I also got the salt and vinegar zapps potato chips which were gluten free but still tasted great. I would definitely come back I try the Matt Cain.
Went to Ike's a while back. There was allot of hype surrounding this place so I HAD to give it a try. I would say the food and experience was decent but not what I had expected. Don't get me wrong, its not bad or anything but seems like there is allot of hype for a sandwich shop. =)
This place is good. The carmel apple pops and bright colors make it feel like an elementary school student came up with a lot of clever sandwich ideas and then actually made a store to sell them.
I'm a sandwich girl so Ike's was something I've been wanting to try for years. We went around 11am and there was no line! After hearing about supposed long lines, I felt pretty victorious. My friend I shared a Menage a Trois and The Damon Bruce both on Dutch Crunch. Both amazing sandwiches although I did enjoy the Menage more. My only complaint about the sandwiches would be that they were a little too messy for my liking. Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars!My other friend ordered the Jaymee Sirewich, which she absolutely fell in love with and said it was her favorite part of SF. It's not on the regular menu so look around the walls to find specialty sandwiches and perhaps the Jaymee may be your thing.
Some of the most AMAZING sandwiches in all of San Francisco. Their menu is huge, and there is always a long line outside the place at lunch time. But the sandwiches are well worth the wait and the price.
As the most reviewed place in San Francisco, I had to try Ike's Place during our brief stay in the city. I tried the Matt Cain and the Mnage A Trois, and they were spectacular. So far, I consider the mnage a trois the best sandwich I've ever eaten. I loved the taste of honey on the sandwich. It was about $12 for each sandwich with chips included (go for the Voodoo flavor). As everyone has mentioned, get it with the Dutch crunch bread. The only downside is that there is limited seating (no tables whatsoever, just two adjacent benches for about 5 people each) which is not enough considering how packed this popular place gets.
Man, where has dutch crunch been my whole life?!Ike's is pretty much as advertised. A San Francisco institution, Ike's offers excellent sandwiches (on marvelously delicious dutch crunch, among other breading options) at affordable prices. The "We're Just Friends" and "Jaymee Sirewich" are both must tries.Ike's gets docked one star in my book for sometimes running out of ingredients (running out of avocados in California, really?), long lines and poor seating. Other than that, it's aces, and an absolute must try!
Best sandwich ever.I like the Jim Rome with turkey, avocado and grilled mushrooms on dutch crunch. The fresh baked bread with "dirty sauce" is SO good.
How have I not already written a review for this place.I came here back before it was on Man vs. Food and it was great. I've been here a couple times since and it's always a great meal.The first time I came I met Ike, and he talked me and my friends into getting the Superman. At first i was skeptical on spending $20 for a sandwich, but this behemoth was 2 meals in one. The onslaught of meat was endless, with only brief moments of lettuce, quickly covered up by jalapeno poppers, mozzarella sticks, and avocado. IT'S DELICIOUS.Everything is great here. The Menage A Trois is also another winner. The Lex Luthor is creative with it's chicken fried steak base, mmmm fried steak.Do your stomach a favor and indulge in a tasty sandwich
After 30 minutes of driving around to find parking I pulled up out front to drop off my 11 year old daughter to pick up the ordered sandwiches at which time I was verbally threatened by not one but two employees "if you stay double parked your little girl will not get sandwiches until you drive away!" Not exactly hospitality . And last time i remember this is the united states where it is your right to choose to get a ticket if stopped by an officer of the law for double parking.So lesson here unless you live in the neighborhood ikes isn't worth the harassment from the employees. if your not within walking distance be prepared to be threatened and talked down to for trying to give them your money.Sorry Ike a sandwich fail for me.
Ike's changed my life! Well, at least my idea of what makes a great sandwich. I've never had anything bad here. Their sandwich creations are unbelievably good! My favorites (always on Dutch crunch):The Bear Hug - Thinly Sliced Rib Eye Steak, Mushrooms, Jalapeo Poppers, Bacon, Extra Dirty SauceMILF - Halal Chicken Breast, Stuffed Jalapeo Poppers, Franks Red Hot, RanchThe Joker (with extra pesto) - All Beef Meatballs, Beer Battered Zucchini, Ike's Red Pesto, RanchShawn Michaels - Thinly Sliced Rib Eye, Bacon, Mozzarella Sticks, Extra Dirty SauceSome of these sandwiches (and others) are may not appear on the SF menu but do at some of Ike's other locations. I'm not sure the rationale behind this but if you order it, they will make it.This location gives you a free bag of chips whereas some of the others do not.This place gets crazy busy during peak eating times, which I try to avoid. There is nowhere to sit inside other than a bench in the window that's always occupied. I also try to call our order in ahead of time (like 30 minutes) and then you can just go up to the register instead of waiting in line. Employees are always super friendly.
I have no idea why anyone would travel to get here, much less make it a tourist destination. It's a sandwich. It's expensive and you will be there an hour. I live in the neighborhood and hadn't been back since it opened. The staff was very nice but everyone was moving at a snail's pace. The people in back were making sandwiches at comically slow speeds and looked like they didn't know what should be on a sandwich. Which isn't surprising with all the options. They need twice the staff, AC for the kitchen, a coat of paint, and more comfortable benches for waiting. The Nacho Boy was very tasty but I won't be back anytime soon.
Con: Get ready to stand in line. But if the product is good, you expect a line, right? Pro: Get ready for a FANTASTIC sandwich. This thing is giant. You may have to eat a light dinner if you have it for lunch.
This is my go-to place anytime I go to San Francisco. It was my bf's first time here so I was very excited to show him the Ike's experience. I ordered the "we're just friends" with pickles and banana peppers with some habanero sauce on the side. And he ordered the Philly cheesesteak (but I forgot to add lettuce and tomatoes on his :X) mine was delicious! I usually get the spiffy tiffy but it's a bit heavy with the cheeses and mushroom, so I enjoyed this one more. We had to eat inside since it was so windy outside, but I always walk away satisfied.
It's one pricey sandwich! The wait is long and the sandwich wasn't even that big. My BF and I thought to split a #95 (don't even remember the name). It tasted ok. But for $10, I don't think we'll be coming back any time soon. There are many other delis that charge less for the same size sandwich.
Although Ike's is definitely an establishment, its overpriced for what they have to offer. The main reason I'd come back here is for the "tourist experience", but as a native it no longer has a place in my routine. The menu is overwhelming, the prices are not worth the food and the experience altogether is rushed and impersonal.
Great Sandwiches and always fun to take out of towners to who don't mind waiting in a little bit of a line.Only reason it is a 4 star is they no longer give you a bag of chips with your sandwich as part of the price. It was already expensive at $10 for your average sandwich but having to pay more now and not get a bag of chips kind of sucks.
So wandering over to get a sandwich at Ike's in the mid-afternoon on a Sunday isn't so smart considering you're looking at a 2 hr line. Best to call in and order ahead, then they can give you an approximate pick-up time and avoid the lines. The bread does make this a tasty sandwich. I prefered the Girl I'm Dating because of the loads of avo they pile on. Can get a bit messy. Dirty sauce is also a plus. Menage a Trois is decent stand-in and SF Giants was satisfying. Bit pricey for a sandwich but it's a hefty size and unique. At least that's what she said.
Overpriced, over hyped sandwiches. They are delicious, but the way people glorify them, just annoys me. Plus, I rather NOT have their secret sauce...ya. I actually just said that.However, their customer service is really great.
Came here during vacation and many of our friends mentioned that this was a great place to stop by. My boyfriend and I are huge foodies and our friends are foodies, so of course we trust that what they say is good, is really good.BOY, were they right! We ordered their Kryptonite sandwich, which was probably the biggest sandwich in all of America. Lol. It was shared between three people with extra to spare! We took the rest for the ride back to LA.For $20, I think it's totally worth it. They STACK it and they are NOT stingy! I forgot what was on it but the avocado was so fresh and delicious.. my mouth is just watering and my stomach is rumbling just thinking about it.-1 star for the lack of seating. It's a rather small place, you don't really dine in. There are about three chairs and a bench. But no tables... the sandwich was huge so it was a little difficult to eat without a table. With that being said, there were no napkins or utensils readily available. I guess SF wants to be green and saved all that stuff. They charge you 10 cents for an extra bag, too.-1 star for it being too hipster. It made me miss home. Lol.
I have no idea what they put in the sauce, but it tasted like happy unicorns and unlimited candy. I always thought my gluten-free life sucks, but I would eat their gluten-free bread all day every day. I have never had a better sandwich in my life and I can't wait to go back and tried all of them. The people I was with ordered two different options and they thought their sandwiches were excellent as well. I wish they delivered!
I'll keep this short and sweet since I'm pretty sure the rest of the 10393897234 reviews takes care of other details.- no seating, which means perfect picnic food (almost, minus the messiness)- don't expect a clean eating. there will be drips. many, many drips. - you will regret if you don't get your sandwich on the Dutch Crunch Roll- my favorite: Menage a Trois- not homemade chips unfortunately, but some of my favorite brands: Dirty and Zapp's!...and I usually don't even like sandwiches!
Well, I stood in line here on a sunday for 45 minutes or so while my sweet geriatric parents sat on wooden chairs thoroughly enjoying the people watching. It was the ultimate circus for them. 40 people all wearing the same glasses and staring at their smartphones. Woo hoo. I have always wondered about Ike's due to the sensation of news and rumors round it. Having become a vegetarian about a year ago, I scour the earth for appropriate sammies now. Luckily Ike has a truckload of options for vegs and vegans. Reading their menu while food porning online recently, I decided to try to get there.At this moment I believe I had the Heath Ledger. It was appropriately crunchy and gooey and salty and fatty. My parents split the "Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian" and liked theirs as well.My feeling about Ike's is the sandwiches are big, expensive, and generally pretty good but they are basically gut bombs. I'd go back, but I probably would not stand in line that long unless I was buying one for my sweet parents again or for a party.
This place is preeeeeetttyyyy yummy! I ordered a Nacho boy with onions and pickles and it was delicious! The serving size is pretty good. I shared one with my bf for lunch and we were happy. Welllll...I ate half of half and he ate half, and the rest of my other half. But it all worked out :)The only strange thing about this place is that there is no where to eat in the restaurant....so we drove to golden gate park and ate with a nice view, which wasn't bad either.The only maaaaaain problem I have is the price....11$ for a sandwich is a little scary!
BEST SANDWICH PLACE EVER. On my trip to San Francisco, my friend and I agree that this was our favorite food out of all the places we checked out. I will admit that I discovered it by watching Man vs. Food, but I didn't realize I would love it this much. If I lived in town I would go here all the time. They have at least four or five vegetarian/vegan sandwiches, and I want to try them all!I had the Dirty Owl with their special Dutch Crunch bread, which was one of the most flavorful, satisfying sandwiches I've ever had. The unique sandwich names amuse me. A sandwich comes with free chips - what a nice surprise! I love free things.I think it's a good idea to not have people pick all their own custom sandwich ingredients, other than the bread, because a brilliant sandwich-maker like Ike knows what he's doing, and you shouldn't mess with Ike. Even at subway, the normal sandwiches have you picking your own cheese and sauces, but you could totally screw up the whole sandwich that way.Along with the food and smiling people, the atmosphere is one of my favorite things - I don't care that there are no tables or chairs. It has a very organic, artsy, hippy vibe, with the wall murals, band flyers, and multiple bins for recycling or disposing of your waste.Ike, you're the best.
After hearing so much about Ike's, I finally went a late afternoon when it wash't crazy busy. I bought a sandwich for my lunch the next day. That was MY mistake. The sandwich was still very good the next day, but Ike's sandwiches are meant to be eaten on the spot. Now I have to go back to experience the real thing. I think everybody loves Ike's for a good reason: great sandwiches.
After wanting to try Ike's for years, we finally tried it and it was delicious! The line gets long very early and it takes quite a while to order your food, but it's worth it. I recommend calling in your order unless you want to wait in the long line. The staff is very friendly and the crowd there was very laid back. We ordered the Matt Cain (with mozzarella sticks) and Hollywood's SF Cheesesteak. Both were delicious. Get it on the dutch crunch bread with the DIRTY sauce and prepare yourself for mouthwatering deliciousness. Don't wait as long as we did to try it!
The Best place to get an awesome MATT CAIN sandwich!Diverse menu of scrumptous Sandwiches that will have you salivating until you take your first bite.....Ike For Mayor!
My first time coming here I got the Kryptonite. It's like 20 bucks but it's pretty much everything, and it's two sandwiches (more or less). A little expensive but considering the quality and amount of food you get, I was totally fine with the pricepoint. I also got a delicious ginger ale to go along with my massive sandwich. The wait is a little long but still completely worth the wait. If you're willing to throw down a little more for a significantly better product, completely worth it.
One of the great things about this place is that you can order ahead. I've only been here once (as of this review), but I know the lines can get super long on a good day, so ordering ahead is a wise move.I ordered the Change sandwich: BBQ sauce, beer battered onion rings, gouda, thinly sliced rib eye. A little messy, but soooo goooooood. I love a lot of sauce of BBQ sauce on my burgers/sandwiches, and they definitely did not disappoint. You also get a bag of chips with your sandwich. I got the Voodoo kettle chips -- a little sweet with a little spice. Really good. I also got a bottle of lemonade, which rounded out the meal nicely.Ike's is a quick walk from Dolores Park, so if there aren't any places to sit nearby, head over to the park if it's a nice day.This is a place I'm definitely going to frequent.
I'm a vegetarian so getting a good sandwich that isn't just sprouts or a portobello mushroom can be hard. They have a great selection here and the sandwich tasted fresh and flavorful. The service was quick and friendly. Great spot!
One of the best sandwiches I've had. I had the BLT but the sandwich had just the right amount of everything.
SO GOOD!!!! Second best sandwich I've ever had (best is still Board and Brew in San Diego). I'm not even that big of a sandwich fan, but I would have this as my last meal ever and be totally happy they are so good.I have to admit I'm so in love with the mnage a trois I haven't even tried anything else. It's all about the dirty sauce. It's so delicious and makes the sandwich perfectly gooey but not soggy.Ike's frequent buyer tip: order through their app. So much easier. I have no idea why people wait in line for hours. Please don't do this. You probably already waited in line for brunch for a few hours this morning. Save yourself some pain...order your sandwich while you're in the brunch line through the app and it will be ready perfectly on time for your Dolores park day. You'll feel like a super smart cookie passing up the line and swooping in for your sandwich. Technology is an amazing thing.Voodoo chips are super good too! They also give you one of those old school carmel apple suckers.Yum! Do not miss out on these amazing sandwiches!!! Go now!! Run! Walk! Take an uber, sidecar, lyft, or flywheel!
I'm glad that I have friends that are such great hosts when I visit San Fran, or else I would have missed this amazing spot. The lengthy line stretching down the block, and mouth watering scents drifting out the door alluded to the popularity and deliciousness of the sandwiches here at Ike's. What stands out most to me, besides the quality of the sandwich, is the depth and breadth of the menu. The sandwiches available cover virtually every palette and taste. I'd be truly shocked if you werent able to find at least one that you liked. I went with the "We're Just Friends", on Dutch Crunch and each bite was better than the next. I had never had Dutch Crunch bread before, and I don't know what it is that makes it so good, but I can't stop thinking about it long after I've left the city.Each sandwich I saw (and I looked at a lot of sandwiches around the shop) looked fresh, gigantic, and thoroughly enjoyed by whoever was eating it. The hardest decision here may have been decided which bag of chips and soda I wanted as the selection was, as expected, vast and appealing.Any chance of Ike's setting up shop in New York? I would be a weekly visitor.
Menage y Trois. Best sub in this great city. Hands down. Dutch Crunch. Go Now.
The taste of the sandwich is yummy, however the bread got soggy really fast. The sandwich would be amazing if the bread is toasted and crunchy. They also give you a caramel apple lollipop. Overall, it's definitely worth a try.
Solid sandwich. Bread was pretty plain. The meat was generic. The sauces were top notch and the toppings were plentiful. The sauce was really what made the sandwich for me.
Best sandwiches ever. Really good vegan and vegetarian option. Long lines be prepared to wait before u go but it's all worth it.
I am excited to announce that I have found my favorite sandwich place. Never have I liked a sandwich more!The afternoon my friends and I arrived in San Francisco, we decided to go give Ike's a try. We parked several blocks away, thinking we might not find parking later on. We were so tired of walking by the time we finally reached Ike's, but so glad were we when we smelled all the sandwiches that were being made in the kitchen. In awe, we stared at the menu of funky names (of athletes, apparently).Paul Reubens... Wow. I think I should have just left it as is, without adding pickles. But it was soooo gooood regardless. It has coleslaw with a particular dressing that is just plain awesome. This sandwich consists of roast beef. I just love it.Matt Cain... Again, the sauce. How do they do it?! Roast beef in this one, as well. Nacho Boy... I was slightly disappointed by this one because it didn't have as good of a sauce as the previous two, and had too much avocado (never thought I would gripe about that). But just because I loved the other sandwiches so much, I'll love this one, too. My love for Ike's doesn't make sense. Hence, my review for it doesn't quite make sense, either.I want to come back here soon. I can't afford many things, but Ike's will not be one of them: $10-14 for the BEST SANDWICH EVER and a bag of chips?! Worth it. So worth it.
Ike's is hands down the best sandwich place I've ever been to. I LOVE every sandwich I had here of course some more than others. I first came here when they had pages and pages of sandwiches for their menu all of which they still offer, but just don't publicize it anymore, I guess to make it easier for people. People think that Ike's just happens to be great but its because Ike is a culinary master! He knows what flavors go well together and each of his sandwiches are a work of art. And of course the dirty sauce is the magic ingredient that turns a great sandwich into a mouthwatering masterpiece! But also something not mentioned enough is that they bake their own bread and its the best bread! So many great sandwich places don't bake their own bread and even if they did it wouldn't be as good as Ike's because Ike's knows how to make the best!My favorite is the meatless mike with sour dough bread. That's what I always get now, but everyone can find their own favorite. That's just the beauty of Ike's. The new location is nice because its more spacious of course I always wish I could sit down and just eat it there because I always want to consume the sandwich (and chips) as soon as I get it. But everyone knows there's always Dolores Park to go to and eat. I've had so many great memories thanks to Ike's and the great staff makes sure you're happy with the entire experience. Make sure to call ahead to help beat the line. And if you haven't been impressed with Ike's BELIEVE ME, its just that you haven't found the right one. When you do, you'll love Ike's forever. The search is worth it.
I love Ike's! Who knew such a cute lil shop could be the source of such delicious sandwiches! On a weekday afternoon, there was a line out the door, but we didn't have to wait long. Even after ordering, the wait wasn't bad either. I had the Mnage a trois with extra dirty sauce. I could've done without the extra dirty sauce but it was still sooo yummy. The boyf had the Matt Cain and really enjoyed it as well! We chose our sandwiches per Yelp review highlights ;)I would def come here again for a sandwich fix but hopefully Dolores Park will be open by then!
Check their online menu before you go because they literally have HUNDREDS of sandwiches. I don't think you can get a bad one. The Monte Cristo was probably one of my top 5 I've ever had. Anywhere. And it was huge. Just don't try to eat inside because there's no seating. Take it to Dolores Park a couple blocks away.
I wish I could give more than five stars. I could eat Ike's forever. I'm not joking.I went here visiting from SoCal and had the Menage a Trois and Matt Cain. Upon the first bite of each sandwich, I was on the verge of tears. My mouth was enraptured by both the threesome and baseball player sandwich. How could something as simple as a sandwich taste so good? I don't understand. Why hasn't your SoCal shop opened yet? I don't understand that either. Please open soon. My life savings are waiting for you.The textures....the dimensions of flavor...the intermingling of different tastes making love to my tongue...I was seriously in euphoria. All because of a piece of bread and cheese and meat and whatever else constituted such a beautiful form of sustenance. I await the day my mouth and an Ike's sandwich are reunited once again with utmost longing and impatience. Because it's been way too long and I need it in my stomach right now.I love Ike's so much that I wrote this creepy review. Thank you, Ike, for being born and creating such awe-inspiring sandwiches. You have endowed my taste buds with deliciousnessosity and I can say that I can die happy now.
Great and fast service. And my favorite sandwich at an almost reasonable price.
Sandwitches: GreatService:  GreatFour thumbs up! (there were two of us).
Ike's is a must-do pit stop for all of my future SF visits! I would never have found it without the help of some awesome San Franciscan's (with a car) who brought us to this sub sandwich haven.I think there are a couple of locations, the one we went to was on 16th street, and it was quite small, so the line that was out the door didn't really take all that long. I got a chicken, avocado, honey mustard & veggies sub (I forgot the name) on their famous Dutch Crunch bread. Sour dough is my faaavorite and they had that as a choice, but I'm so glad I heeded everyone's advice and went with dutch crunch...it was AWESOME! Something I didn't get, but I wish I had, was the stuffed jalepeno add-on!We didn't find parking, so we were dropped off. I saw lots of (unavailable) street parking, but I couldn't even begin to suggest where you might look otherwise. But even if you have to walk here...or park illegally and get a ticket...IT'S WORTH IT!
You can surely read about this restaurant's legendary sammich making skills for days on this site. It's constantly hailed as one of San Francisco's top food places of SFist and the food blogs, notwithstanding, it's even talked about on a daily basis from the gentrified hipster elitist corners of the Mission, to the too high to function, weird artistic kids in the Dog Patch. It's really that good and it really appeals to all. Some of my favourites include these:Lex LuthorLove TriangleName of the Girl I'm DatingSF GiantsUgly OwlKryproniteFat BastardMake sure you hit the gym afterwards, as they're over 1k calories each.Protip: Call in your order at least 20 minutes ahead of time. The line is a bastard every darn day.
All I can say is that I get my Ike's "fix" at least one Sunday every month and it has been worth the wait EVERY TIME. Have only been to the Mission location but I'm sure the rest are just as tasty.Tip- download the app and order it for pick up an hour before your cravin that sando.
Had their Menage-a-Trois. Delicious.
I went at 3PM on a Monday, and didn't wait for long. The taste is worth 5 stars, but I am giving 3 stars for sanitary reasons:I found a strand of hair on my sandwich when I opened it up. After telling the lady at the front desk about it, she had them make a new one for me. There was no hassle and she was real professional about it, but I was a bit turned off...I ate 1/4th of my superman sandwich and admitted defeat. It was the most outrageous yet delicious sandwich I've ever had.
I had the menage au trois. Hands down the best sandwich I've ever had.
This place is great!! Not to mention there're so many options. If you look online for their secret menu, there's even more choices. Only downside is they don't have free chips anymore =( and of course, expect a line.
Nah,,, I've had better. Not surprised with the quality and quantity of the meat at all. For the price I paid I could get better. All I could taste was the 4 tiny piece of banana peppers and the bread. Also the watery 1000 islandish sauce that I forgot what was the name. Even the place is so filthy and made me feel like it was for drifters. Even the cashiers were weird. Not clean environment . I'm not offending the people who likes this place or work at this place. But nobody was wearing aprons??? Or gloves. I don't know,,, hope I'm not going to get sick after eating their sandwich. It's not only my opinion tho. My husband felt the same way.
This place is phenomenal!!! I ordered the Captain Kirk and it was the best sandwich I've ever had...bar none. The average wait time is ridiculous, (averaging 45 minutes) but I knew this ahead of time and so I called our orders in. I would have to say that this is probably the best sandwich in the city! My boyfriend ordered the Barry B and he was stoked as well. We will definitely be returning!
Damn where do I start.Having heard that this place was THE sandwich shop to go to in SF, I had to try it. It was a small joint, and people seemed to be getting the sandwich to go for the most part. I ordered the Matt Cain on dutch crunch bread with extra dirty sauce on the side. The bread was actually amazing - perfect level of crunch along with the moist, fluffiness interior. It was the perfect bread to compliment ridiculous amount of juicy, warm deli meats along with the sauce and sides. Overall, it was very tasty and I could certainly see why they call it a SF staple. Would definitely return.
tl;dnr: Believe the hype. San Francisco's finest and most famous sandwiches are right here. 100+ sandwiches, great dutch crunch, and the best sandwich spread known to man. Because of this wait time can get crazy, but trust, its worth it every time. Basics: The man, the myth, the legend: Ike Shehadeh and his arsenal of hundreds of sandwiches (including a secret menu) have got the San Francisco sandwich game on lock. Just cruise by sometime around the afternoon and you'll see the line wrapped around the block. The wait can get insane so from me to you here's a tip to beat the lines. Protip: call and order your sandwiches in advance. The line to order sandwiches, which is often monstrous, is separate from the line to pick up your sandwich once ordered in restaurant or via phone. Skip one long line just by calling in advance. A few faves: Madison Baumgarner: thin sliced rib eye, chipotle salsa, pepper jack, American cheese, Ike's spread, lettuce, tomato, always add onion.Mnage trois: three cheeses, halal shredded chicken, honey mustard, Ike's spread, real honey, lettuce.Jaymee Sirewich; fried chicken, spread, cheese, yellow honey mustard barbecue sauce, lettuce.Cool story bro: Ran into Ike himself at Lou's Cafe, had to shout him out and tell him his sandwiches are better than Lou's. Nice guy, gave me and my girlfriend a pair of free sandwich cards.
Oh my God....where do I begin!?My boyfriend and I first moved to SF in 2012 and hadn't even heard of Ike's until we saw an older episode of Man Vs. Food. We were determined to try this place after seeing the amazing sandwiches.Our first experience was to die for! My very first sandwich was the Damon Bruce (a fantastic steak sandwich) and I ordered it with cream cheese, jalapeo poppers, mozzarella sticks and extra dirty sauce. AMAZING! My boyfriend tried the Kryptonite (a monstrous sandwich that is literally like 2 separate sandwiches). It took him 3 days to eat it. We will come back over and over again! Ike, your place is awesome and your staff is amazing! A simple idea with extraordinary food! I wish I could give this place 100 stars!
What?!?!?!? I always thought I wrote a review for Ike's but apparently I never did so. Well here were go. Ike's has the best sandwiches in San Francisco period. I get the usual Elvis Keith which comes with Wasabi, Chicken, Mayo, Teriyaki, and Swiss on Dutch Crunch bread. The Elvis Keith is the bomb when it comes to the ingredients they use as it brings out a good taste. I would also recommend getting all the extra ingredients they have like Lettuce, Tomatos, and the Dirty Sauce. All their sandwichs come with a bag of Zapp's Chips of your choice where I would recommend their the Voodoo Heat flavored one and a caramel lollipop. The service here is very good and they servers are very friendly. But the downsides it that there can be long lines during lunch but they also have an app where you can order your sandwiches and it will be ready for you to pick up at a certain time slot of your choice. I have been a customer of Ike's since 2008 when they were at the location down the street but unfortunately they got evicted due to complaints of their Dirty sauce and the queuing of lines so they moved to the present location which was much bigger. I would usually recommend getting your sandwiches togo since they have very limited seating. I usually eat in my car but I would advise people to not to park in front of someones driveway,
I love Ike's! But why don't the sandwiches come with chips anymore?
Overrated, overpriced & poor service..They think because they have a cult following, they can be rude to new/unfamiliar customers! :/ Dinosaurs up the street half the price and waaaayy better service!!
Were just friends.sure, that may be the name of the sandwich i shared (totally shareable) with my brother...by the way i devoured each bite, i would claim our relationship was closer to 3rd base. thats right, the chicken with orange glaze, avo and pepperjack on dutch crunch bread and i are d e f i n i t e l y friends with benefits. --- can i petition a name change, Ike?after a disappointing day full of mediocre food and event experiences (i know, what did i expect of the tourist areas of SF) and chain restaurant fail (again, i knooooow), ike's place came to the rescue. my bro and i strolled over right at noon and i expected to see a long lunch time line.NOPE! monday at noon FTW!!! there was probably 4 people ahead of us...less than 10 min wait, and less than 10 min food arrival. we took the fresh hot sammie to the park down the way and thats where i crossed the friendship line.worth it? hell yeah. that bread....oh that delicious FRESSH bread...amazing. the orange glaze (made it sort of a spin on orange chicken)...really unique. cheese? cheese makes every better - esp. melty goodness. avvvvocado. yep, generous hearty chunks.Ike's proved yet again that local hole in the walls are *aways* the better decision when traveling. ill take wrapped in paper over froo-froo plate presentation any day if its that good B-)
I live in San Diego and adore my local sandwich shop, but ever since I ate at Ike's I can't shake the feeling that I'm missing out! Long lines are always a positive and there aren't any tables so it gives you a good excuse to head to the nearest steps or park and enjoy San Francisco. I ordered the "Backstabber" 4 times and we were only in SF for a day. I felt like one for betraying my sandwich shop, but once you simply smell the Caesar dressed Halal Chicken you want to dig in. Interesting drinks and extremely fun staff!
IKE, YOU HAVE GREATLY DISAPPOINTED ME.I used to tell people that the best sandwich I have ever eaten was at Ike's Place but when I visited last week I discovered that you somehow think you can lower the quality of your sandwiches and still coast along on your good reputation. You still get 3 stars only because your sandwiches are decent sized and unique, but your sandwiches are hit or miss and I now have to say, "I can get better consistency elsewhere." I have been twice recently and sampled 5 different sandwiches: the 'We're JUST Friends', the 'Paul Reubens', the 'Matt Cain', the 'Going Home for Thanksgiving', and the 'Spiffy Tiffy'. I will first discuss the good things I experienced: 1) Great customer service. 2) The 'We're JUST Friends' is pretty good - a reasonable portion of Halal chicken complemented by a refreshing orange sauce. 3) The 'Going Home for Thanksgiving' - I added bacon to it for an extra $1.01 and it was amazing! The perfect balance of sweetness and tartness from the cranberry sauce, spiciness from the sriracha, and saltiness and smokiness from the bacon. However, the other sandwiches I had here were definitely not worth $10 each.Disappointment #1: WHERE HAS ALL THE MEAT GONE?? The Matt Cain and Paul Reubens each only contained less than 1/2 cm thick layer of meat. I have uploaded 2 photos to illustrate the difference I have observed in the last 4 months. Check out the 'Do you smell what Barack is cooking' (ribeye steak, BBQ sauce, Gouda) from Feb 2011: yelp.com/user_local_phot. Now look at the 'Paul Reubens' (pastrami, cole slaw, Swiss) from June 2011 (and note that the tomato slices are directly above the pastrami so do not mistake that for meat): yelp.com/user_local_phot. I could barely taste the pastrami! Next time if I'm in the neighborhood and want pastrami I am going to M&L market instead.Disappointment #2: YOUR DUTCH CRUNCH TASTES LIKE DAY OLD BREAD!! I have yelped a handful of Italian delis and always commented how their bread is not as good as Ike's but it appears that your bread quality is now dropping to below their level. What happened to the delicate crunch on the top of the Dutch crunch and what happened to that moist, chewy center that I used to love? I have recently visited Ike's on 2 separate occasions and both times I have been served Dutch crunch bread that is dry and not actually crunchy on top. Furthermore, the top and bottom slices are each only ~1 cm thick. If you don't believe me check out this photo: yelp.com/biz_photos/dold. Believe me, save yourself the frustration and get the SF Sourdough instead - that is still up to their old standards! Disappointment #3: Fatty meat! We found significant amounts of fat in both our roast beef and pastrami. It is not acceptable to substitute meat with fat! Disappointment #4: The Matt Cain. The sandwich we received is a disgrace to Matt Cain and is completely unworthy of winning the title of ESPN's best sports sandwich. What hungry Giants fan will be satiated by a $10 sandwich containing one slice of roast beef, one slice of turkey, and a single layer of salami? The picture of the Matt Cain sandwich that won ESPN's contest is a total misrepresentation. Disappointment #5: The Spiffy Tiffy. Bland. Way too earthy flavors (pesto, mushrooms, avocado) and no punch of flavor. I will never order this again.I used to eat 3/4 of an Ike's sandwich and feel stuffed the rest of the day. This time, due to the lack of protein, after eating an entire sandwich for lunch I still had room for dinner.Ike, PLEASE EITHER RAISE YOUR STANDARDS OR LOWER YOUR PRICES!!
easily top 3 best sandwich of my life! this is the closest i have gotten thus far in my gastrointestinal journey to the famed "fat" sandwich of rutgers where they put everything on the list with insane toppings and insane sauces. this place is my brother's favorite. there are no tables, just order and get out. it is recommended to walk the two blocks to the park down the street for a picnic.the bread is epic! the sauce is mind blowing! fat, enormous amazing sandwiches are what are on tap and it was worth the wait!i got the matt cain...godfather sauce, provolone, roast beef, salami, turkey on the dutch bread with onion rings on top....awesome...messy....awesomely messy....and definitely worth the trip and the wait!
3.5 stars I hear awesome things about this place all the time so its hard not to have expectations. Coming by on a sunny Saturday during lunchtime, I was surprised the line wasnt terrible. Even better, the service went by swiftly. Their interesting selection of sandwiches (with veggie options) are worth reading through every single one. Usually, I find one that fits my craving and dont bother going on to read more. But here at Ike's, their ingredients seem too unique to make just a quick glance at. Their quirky and honorary San Francisco Giants sandwich names are fun too! I ordered the [Name of the Girl I'm Dating] but as the order was ready, I saw they had made me a Menage a Trois. I made a face because it wasn't what I had originally wanted. Nevertheless, the Menage was my second choice and I didn't want to wait any longer. First bite in? I aint mad no mo'. Lol, it was the best sandwich I've had in a long time. Ike's you lucked out! I like that they aren't stringent on the halal chicken and give a good ratio of meat,sauce,lettuce,and tomatoes. Other places tend to do poorly with this. Other pros.... its nice they give free chips. Above all, if you dont get dutch crunch, you're totally missing out!!!!!!!! So fresh and tasty, makes the sandwich in my opinion. My Con... parking is difficult. I thought the sandwich was great and had wholesome flavors, but not spectacular that I want to drive out here, find parking, and wait in line again. I'll try calling in next time maybe.
Decent place to grab lunch, but only if you're really hungry.. .the sandwiches are huge! There's no seating here, but it was actually really nice to get the sandwich to go and then picnic in Dolores park.I got the Name of the Girl I'm Dating on the dutch crunch, which was decent but could have used more flavor. I think I'd get something different next time.
4.5 stars One of the best sandwiches I have had. Their dutch bread and their special sauce did the trick. enough said. Lost 1/2 a star because they recently raised their prices. It was about $24 for 2 sandwiches which is a little on the higher side.
Little known menu item I couldn't find on the online or in-store menus: the MILF. Hot buffalo sauce, ranch dressing, jalapeo poppers, and chicken.It is cocaine.
Awesome sandwiches. Huge variety. Online menu has many more than their in store menu in fact. There's very little seating, but it's a great sandwich takeaway place.
Good GOD I love these sandwiches. I want to eat them always. The bread is fresh baked and the vegan/vegetarian options are AMAZING. Life tips:-- Friend Ikes on facebook. He gives away sandwiches/deals pretty often (I'm up to two free sandwiches and a "skip the line" pass!), so it's worth the Like. -- Vegans/Veggies should look up the menu online before going to Ike's. They only list about 4 or 5 sandwiches on their board, but they have a ton. -- Love Triangle. UGH SO GOOD. -- Veggie bacon added on to any sandwich. Nom.The SF location gives free chips/lollipops with their sandwiches, other locations charge for chips. If you're at the 16th and Sanchez location, I recommend walking over to dolores park to eat and people watch.
These are some no joke sandwiches, with no joke prices to boot, but when it comes down to it, they are every bit as delicious the hype has set them out to be. Much has been said about the long lines, but if you can score a money sammy from Ike's without the wait you're already a step closer to winning in life.The key to every great sandwich is quality bread. From wheat to gluten free, Ike's bakes them all fresh daily. Their most popular bread, the Dutch Crunch, is similar to Tiger Bread and adds a new dimension of texture and flavor for all sandwiches. One bite and infinite crunches later, the path to foodgasm is that much greater.There are so many options that it's hard to cover them all in one review. All appetites should be covered (light-spicy-gut bombs, etc.), along with lots of choices for vegans and meatheads alike. If that doesn't show versatility in the sandwich game, I don't know what to does.Want to start slow? Shoot for one of the menu's cheapest options, such as the Chipper's Fave ($8) which is a simple combo of tuna, american cheese, and avocado, which tastes wonderful cold or room temperature. Meat lovers with a vegetarian limitation would likely enjoy the Meatless Mike ($10), a concoction of vegan meatballs, marinara, and soy cheese that even carnivores would appreciate. Throw in a side of their air-y fries, which are baked, for some guilt free eating.Continuing on the vegan path, I can't stop ordering the Health Ledger ($13), which contains vegan meatballs, beer battered zucchini, ikes red pesto, ranch dressing, and is underrated compared to their most popular items. The most gourmet of all veggie / vegan sandwiches is the Tom Brady ($13), a concoction of vegan breaded chicken, garlic and herb sauce, mushrooms, avocado, soy cheese, the kind of stuff vegan dreams are made of.The Damon Bruce ($13) is a mean sammy of thinly sliced rib eye, A1 steak sauce, beer battered onion rings, provolone. That one alone puts me in food coma mode. I'm also a sucker for the Al Bundy, another sub $10 sandwich that consists of ham, salami, french dressing, avocado, and cheddar cheese. Piled high on some Dutch Crunch with a slather of dirty sauce, this sammy is nothing less than a party in my mouth.Gluttons can appreciate any of these sandwiches, but the wannabe competitive eaters of the world would love any of their $20 sandwiches. Sure, the Doomsday is nice, but the Kryptonite is where it's at. What goes in this monster sammy? Roast beef, corned beef, pastrami, salami, turkey, bacon, ham, mozzarella sticks, stuffed jalapeno poppers, beer battered onion rings, avocado, pesto, extra pepper jack. It is stupid good and the consummate hearty meal. And now you know why I dedicated an entire paragraph to it.If you haven't been to San Francisco / live in San Francisco / love sandwiches / eat food / breathe air / have some type of money and an appetite, you should pay Ike's a visit. There is nothing like a quality sandwich from a one of a kind Bay area establishment.
Menage a Tois, my favorite threesome. Matt Cain is downright delicious.The wait will be a while depending on time of day (I frequent during midday-3/4 awkward hours of lunching) Their sauce is wonderful. I prefer my sandwiches fresh and hot. If you wait too long, the once crunchy bread will transform in to a soggy loaf. * you get a free bag of kettle chips AS WELL as a caramel apple pop. = the perfect brown bag.
Their sandwich was amazing!!!! You have to get the dirty sauce with it and eat it right away. The Dutch crunch bread was like no other. It was the BOMB!!
It's been years since I've been back so this was a necessary stop. It wasn't very crowded when we came which was nice. We got the Damon and Mnage sandwiches. Both delicious and flavorful!! Dutch crunch bread is always a must along with their dirty sauce. Can't wait for this place to open in San Diego!!
It was interesting to eat here. I love the bread. Also, the sandwich is packed it meats and other things but it isn't huge to the point where you can't bite it. It can get crowded so prepare for a wait. All I got to say is that Ike should definitely open one in SoCal.
I'm normally not a huge sandwich person, but this was amazing. I got the mnage a trois, which was just enough honey sweet with a whole lot of meat. It was enough to feed two people for an in-between lunch. Also comes with a bag of chips. Worth going out of the way to come here. Would definitely come back next time. You can also bring the sandwich with you to eat at Alamo Square Park.
So many sandwiches yet so little space in my stomach...The husband and I headed out to Ike's after my RnR half marathon. We decided to take Bart from Union Square Powell station to 16th Mission (for those of you without a car in town). It was a bit of walk despite the public transportation, and I think I should've taken the Muni instead. In any case, the line was of course out the door on an early Sunday afternoon. There were also lots of people waiting for the restaurant next door. I contemplated whether or not I should just call and order my food while standing in line. But I decided to go against it because we were in no hurry to go anywhere. This might be a smarter option for those who are pressing for time. We had plenty of time to decide what sandwiches we want, and the smart phone made it easy to pull up the entire menu at the palm of my hand. My suggestion is go with what YOU like, instead of reading what everyone else suggests. I decided to go with the Spiffy Tiffy because I like chicken, avocado, cheese, and mushrooms. The chicken was a little too dry for my liking, but the sauce and avocado added creaminess to my sandwich. I can't remember what my husband got...but something with beef, onion rings, and cheese. We each got a bag of chips and soda to go because the meal just wouldn't be complete without them. We walked over to Dolores Park to enjoy our delicious food. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience and even topped it off with some Bi-Rite ice cream afterwards. Final Verdict: Highly recommended, and I would suggest splitting it with someone else because the portion is pretty generous.
For an Ike's first timer, it definitely lived up to all the hype. I got the back stabber on Dutch crunch and it did not disappoint. The sandwiches are a bit pricey and lines are always long but I would come again.
We drove all the way from San Diego in August on a 2 week road trip and I believe Ike's sandwiches were the most amazing things we ate on the trip. The place was packed but we got our sandwiches within a reasonable amount of time. They were expensive but the sandwiches can be split between two meals. There isn't any in-house seating so you'd have to take everything togo. I highly recommend coming to this place and check out their giant sandwiches!
Ike's is by far one of the best sandwiches you can get in the city! Everything from the bread to the meat to the sauces is absolutely delicious! The only issue is everyone else in the city also seems to be aware of this which means theres always really long lines. I recommend you order ahead of time and skip the line.
Super Overrated, I could make way better sandwiches at home !
When I arrived to SF five years ago, I heard a ton about a place called Ike's around 16th. I tried it. Then I tried again. And again and again. Then one of those cold San Francisco days, I was hungry, and got myself a Kryptonite. My sandwich experience hasn't been the same ever since. Thank you Ike's for dreaming and inventing the perfect sandwich.
Ikes is a small spot that offers up some great options for the average sandwiches. I am a vegetarian and my most favorite thing is that they have so many options and not just your average veg sprout thing. The food was super good that I wished I was hungry enough to eat another one. Its a great spot!
I feel the need to hype up Ike's as much as I possibly can because this place has the best sandwiches I've ever come across (though a lot of people have been telling me otherwise as I've yet to try the Earl in Vegas). Regardless, I stand by Ike's down to earth place with the most heavenly sandwiches ever.What I have the most trouble with when I come here is deciding on what sandwich to get...because they all sound amazing and I cannot for the life of me try every single sandwich. And there's always that question of whether I want to try something new or stick with my staple safe go-to order.My personal favorites:We're JUST Friends[Name of the Girl I'm Dating]MILFAnd most def the Menage a Trois and Matt Cain.The place got rid of paper menus and only have a limited listing of their sandwiches on their display board. For the full menu and secret menu, hit up their website and the internet!Always on Dutch Crutch with the Dirty Chips and an old-fashioned bottle of soda.Beat the line by placing your order through phone or online.Oh, and Ike's by far has the BEST Twitter. He's always offering giveaways for free sandwiches and goodies, follow him and most definitely stop by Ike's frequently!
So deliciously good! My husband and I are from WI and made it a point to visit I ke ' s when we visited San Francisco. I had The Joker, so unbelievably good and my husband had the Bear Hug, also delicious. Both very different sandwiches but equally yummy! Must visit!!
The sandwich was really good. What won even more points for me was the great customer service and yummy root beer on hand. This place was defenently worth trying out!
Used to like this place, but the sandwiches just haven't been good the last few times -- they're all just really fatty to the extent you physically feel awful afterwards, even if you eat just half. I'm not a picky eater, and I don't have a sensitive stomach either. The bread seems oiled, there's cheese, avocado, mayo-based spread, and fatty meat or fried falafel/vegan patty in some combination in every sandwich. Even the "lighter" sandwiches go overboard. This review does not take into account the 1.5-2 hour lag time between ordering and receiving your sandwich, because anyone that knows Ike's knows that's just part of the deal when eating here. However, when you get your sandwich there is no where to eat it, so by the time you get it anywhere the bread and wrapper are soaked. There are just so many other options near by, I wonder how they manage to maintain the large daily lunch queue -- probably first-timers curious about the hype.
Pluses - lots and lots of veggie options, if you like fake meat (I dont). "Sometimes Im a vegetarian" is what I usually go for, as a result. I know people rave about this place, and it IS a good sandwhich...but its a good sandwhich, and that's about it. Priced about what I'd pay for what Im getting...thus the three stars. Not as much 'wow' factor as others claim it has.
Menage a trois on dutch crunch - best sandwich in SF. Done. Don't put it in a bag with other stuff though...flavor juices might leak.
The spiffy tiffy is amazing . I choose Dutch bread which I was told was the yummiest . The flavor of the chicken with the pesto spread is an amazing blend with mushrooms and cheese . My hubby enjoys the kryptonite which is plenty to share . I learned my lesson the first time call ahead and don't wait .
Pretty good pastrami sandwich, the "Paul Reubens," which had good coleslaw but probably not enough pastrami meat compared to the amount of coleslaw and the size of the bun.
Always will be a fan of Ike's Place until the world ends. Everything about the sandwich is wonderful - the dutch crunch bread, diiiiiirty sauce, how every combination they create is overwhelmingly delicious and beats any sandwich shop around. My favorite sandwich used to be the Menage A Trois but now I'm a huge Going Home For Thanksgiving fan. The vegan option, The Pilgrim, is equally delicious. The portions are huge and I love eating it with chips or their homemade sodas. They also throw in a caramel apple lollipop or blow pop in the baggy. It makes me feel like a child again but in a good way.Trust me and thousands of other reviewers when I say a visit to Ike's Place in the Mission is necessary for a trip to SF. There are many Ike's Lairs around the Bay Area but this is the location where it all started. Do yourself a big favor and try it out if you haven't! You will not regret it. To be fair parking is hard in this area and the wait can get very long because this is the original Ike's Place, but do go at least once in your life. You're welcome.
Delicious. I got the mnage a trois on the Dutch crunch roll bread. It might be pricier than your normal sandwiches (~$10) but you get a bunch of stuff packed into that sandwich.I also really liked the pepper and salt chips (I think that's what it's called).
Sure, let me add my two cents to the 3500+ reviews already written. Sounds ridiculous, I know, but when it's good everyone wants to rave about it. Including me. But, fear not, I'll keep this one (fairly) short. I've been to the previous location, so this new home is a definite upgrade! There's a seated waiting area that was remiss at the old spot. We didn't order ahead of time, but the wait wasn't as bad as I expected it to be on a Sunday afternoon. Hubby & I split a sammich and thought that the Matt Cain would do the trick. And did it ever. The sammich is stuffed with roast beef, turkey, salami, godfather sauce and provolone. On dutch crutch. With Dirty Sauce. Oh yeah, and we added stuffed jalapeno poppers. Add the complimentary dirty chips & caramel apple pop, and you're good to go. Ike's has an extensive menu and we've tried just a handful. There are also tons of veggie & vegan choices. Every visit has been a gastronomic feast. As the hubby says, It hurts so good. Ike is a cool cat as well. It's a bit harder to catch him nowadays since he's blowin' up and expanding the biz.
They opened up an Ike's at my school, so I thought I was Iked out after a few years of non-stop "Your clever name" sandwiches.And then I saw the original, and I felt nostalgic. I've tried a bunch of the sandwiches (including the obscenely large 20-dollar monsters) and I eventually settled on the Elvis Keith as my favorite. It's a delicious, wet, halal chicken sandwich that's super tender, sweet, and tangy. Really, it's everything I can ask for in a sandwich. I just can't eat too many of them.So go forth, try Ike's and find the right Ike's for you.
the first stop in the trifecta of the quintessential san francisco visit.there is always a line outside of ikes and rightfully so, it's one of the best places for sandwiches. my tip to you is phone in your order. the wait varies on how busy they are but they have this cool option where you can tell them when you want to pick it up. so we phoned in our order around 1130am and had requested it ready for pick-up at 1pm. when we got there we bypassed the long line and got our sandwiches in minutes. i got the [name of girl i'm dating], and got to try the cheesesteak and the jessica rabbit as well. all the sandwiches were served on dutch crunch bread and it's the perfect roll to hold such a saucy sandwich. we all loved our sandwiches and gave a big thumbs up to coming back for future visits. phone in your sandwich, pick it up, and walk over a couple of blocks to dolores park, where you can enjoy it while watching a game of dodgeball. perfect lunch.
Before resting on the seventh day, the Lord created Ike's Place and people came to worship. Just go get the sandwich. Get the Dutch Crunch. Get the Voodoo chips. Get whatever you want because it'll be good. And then come back for more.Also, if you try to go to a great sandwich place at 12:15 pm on a sunny Friday and whine about how long the line was, shame on you.
Hygiene is horrendous!!!!The Matt Cain sandwich is unusually delicious. The combination of provolone, beef, salami and turkey is hearty and well-paired with the sweet, mayonnaise and mustard sauce. I also really enjoyed the different flavors of potato chips that come with the sandwich. But seriously, the bathroom's toilet was flooded worse than a port-a-potty at a music festival.
this is definitely a landmark destination in SF.  I had to give it a try while in the city being a tourist and after seeing the massive Yelp reviews.  I took the muni line from where I was staying in The Financial district and a short walk over to Ike's from the Church station. Business was steady/heavy but it moved along quite reasonably, everyone was friendly and the food was as advertised. Not disappointed.  Count me down as a fan of the Dutch Crunch bread, Dirty Sauce and the Matt Cain.
We've all seen this line. We've all contemplated whether or not it was worth. "It's probably just hype," we tell ourselves. Wrong. This place is great.I love it here. Their prices raised a bit since moving, but I could barely finish half a sandwich. So 10 bucks for two meals and chips doesn't seem so bad to me.
WOW. Ice cream is to DIE FOR. 5 stars. worth the 20 minute wait. A short walk to Dolores park. What a great way to spend a SF afternoon!
absolutely love this place!!!! I would go here once a week if I could. I always get the Stephen Jenkins on dutch crunch because I love pesto. I would suggest getting light on the dirty sauce because otherwise you won't taste the pesto.
If you have not been, go.. .like, right now.hands down best sandwiches in Sonoma County
Yummy yummy sandwiches! Yum yum yumtown!Sidenote I came on yelp to do recon for a romantic dinner I'm having soon in the middle of nowhere, Pennsylvania and yelp was like, "Ike's place, have you been here, yay!" and I was like "GREAT SANDWICHES MUST BE TALKED ABOUT"So I will say that I forget the name of the sandwiches I've had which is funny because the names are part of the charm. They're unforgettable! (Almost!) Gluten free bread options! Oh yeah, son. So trendy. (Genuinely appreciated by the candida infested/celiac sufferers).Sliiiiightly messy. One time I got sandwiches before going to a music festival in Golden Gate park and it was SO HOT and I wish I had more napkins and like a sink would have been helpful to wash my hands but that was my own stupid fault and then it was so so so hot and I was dehydrated and then there was a pirate with a machete and some coconuts and I bought one for 10 dollars and he was going to pour rum into it but I just wanted the coconut water and I don't even LIKE coconut water but I drank it anyway and also in that moment I think I lost my driver's license and then flew back home to the best coast and thank god I had my passport. Take these babies anywhere to eat (preferably home to a dark corner where no one can see your face in a sandwich because it's so good you'll want to shove your face INTO the sandwich) and don't forget to grab some extra napkins!
Man vs Food did not steer me wrong by introducing me to this place! The sandwiches here are yummy, hot, and filling! The sandwiches cost between $8-12... a little bit pricey but I think they are worth it. Each sandwich comes with chips. On their menu board you will see a list of sandwiches but they have a lot more available. You have to go on the website to see all they offer.This place is very small and basically a hole in the wall. But hey, sometimes those places have the best food! No tables to sit at and eat here. Its purely a order to-go place. Heck there's only a few chairs to sit on while you wait for your food... it pretty much standing room only. You have to pay attention when you search for this place because you can easily miss it. I found it, almost missed it lol. Somehow I can during an off hour I guess... the place was still packed but it wasn't out the door crazy... the line was just TO the door lol. I ordered a Hollywood Philly steak and it was so good. Melted cheese, packed with meat and sauce oozing all over the place. Take that Carl's Jr... if it doesn't get all over the place it doesn't belong I your face! My brother ordered a spicy chicken one- dont remember the name but I tried it and it was good too. Oh so that reminds me, there are extra things u out can put on the sandwich- some free some extra cost. My brother added some of that yellow peppers and that was free. Fries and onion rings are extra cost... and I was a bit disappointed when I found out you can't get them as a separate side but only on the sandwich. I'd for sure come back!! Go on a Sunday and park free on the street!
The sandwiches are amazing!!!!
Thank you Man vs Food! AWESOME food! ENTERTAINING MENUS!  Tip: Don't sit at the "bar" to eat with your kids...they like to ask the people what the monitors are for.....haha.
First time here and it lives up to the hype. Went splitsy and got the Matt Cain and Going Home For Thanksgiving. Both were delicious!Don't let the sriracha sauce in the Going Home for Thanksgiving sandwich put you off. It's not spicy but adds a great flavor twist. Went for lunch on a Tuesday and wait wasn't too bad. Noticed tons of people called in their orders for pick up.Nowhere to eat there, but take a stroll down to Dolores Park and enjoy your sandwich with a view :)
I've had a sandwich brought to me, and it was delicious.However, when I went in person... I waited in line for twenty minutes. I started ordering, "blah blah on gluten-free bread" and she tells me they are out of gluten-free bread today. Instead of losing it (they should either not run out or lift a finger, like tape a sign in the window, to inform customers), I told them I couldn't eat there and walked out.Like many reviews of mine are turning out to be... If you're gonna do gluten-free, do it right.
More like Yikes Place, am I right?I got the Sometimes I'm Vegetarian and it left a really gross taste in my mouth. I don't know if it's what they grilled the mushrooms in or what, but I was not a fan.They also threw in chips and I didn't want them. I know they're trying to be cool and throw in some "extras" but I wasn't feeling them. I'm not a big chip fan and I hate forced chip acquisition. There are no tables and, instead, two benches. I sat with some hoodrats. They were polite, though, as one of them said the phrase "just the tip" and his comrade informed him a lady was present and he shouldn't say that.It's a really big sandwich, though. Defsies two meals if you can stomach it.
I love this place I used to live near ikes but since have moved, I wake up at night craving one of their sandwiches, Recently I was working on a fashion show at the Westin St. Francis, and Ike's fed everyone that was working, I was hungry!! and when I found out this place was catering, I was so excited!!
Soooooo good omg. Had the elvis keith and replaced the swiss with cream cheese (cashier suggested it) and wow top 3 sandwiches for me. Friend got the lincecum and that was goid too also got a parking spot RIGHT outside
This is my first time at Ike's Place. I came with my boyfriend around 2 PM on a thursday and the line was not that bad (it was in the building). Ambiance: The place itself is small and there might be a few seats along the window, but I wasn't really aware of it since we waited outside. It's in a nice neighborhood and not to far from Mission Dolores Park, which is a nice place for you to eat your sandwich.Service:It was nice that the sandwich was brought out outside the building instead of having the customer have to stay in the cramped room and listen for their name. Food: I ordered the "Lincecum" on dutch crunch. It composed of avocado, bacon, ham, havarti, and turkey. It was simply delicious and I can't wait to go back and try another sandwich. My boyfriend got the 1/2 Spiffy Tiffy. It is composed of avocado, halal chicken, mushrooms, pepper jack, pesto, and provolone. Again it was scrumptious. I have nothing bad to say about the sandwiches. Each sandwich comes with a bag of Zapp's chips and a lollipop. We got the original and bbq ranch. My sandwich was $11.11 and my boyfriends was $9.99.with a total of $23.05. For sandwiches this good and at a decent size, I guess the price is alright. This place is definitely a must try! I will be coming back in the future.
Their sandwiches are AMAZING! The bread and ingredients are so fresh. You must try the Dutch crunch bread. I got the Damon Bruce and Manage a Trios, and it left me craving for more! The wait can take awhile so call ahead to place an order. The wait is worth it!
I'm a big fan of sandwiches especially ones with a name like 'name of the girl i'm dating' which is my favorite. I first found out about Ike's place from one of Adam richman's food related shows on the travel channel. When a restaurant is showcased on a show I am watching in San Francisco, it automatically gets a try.Their sandwiches are very delicious with moist and tender chicken, ike's sauce, and free bag of chips and the occasional blowpop or caramel candy lollipop. I'm not a VIP member at ikes nor do I ever call in to place an order so I'm just like any regular walk-in customer taking my spot in line to order which can take a while and meter change if I can't locate any residential parking. And I feel their prices are just a tad too high but it's still fine for me to go there every long now and then.Sandwich lovers is a must-try!
I suppose if you like sandwiches, this place is a hit. They have a TON of options and they have halal meat options too, which is great. My friend loved his, maybe because he kept it simple. Mine was just ok... I couldn't really taste the toppings (guac, onions, etc). The shredded chicken was good, though. It's a pretty big sandwich and I couldn't finish it in one sitting and they have a TON of options for chips and drinks as well. The french bread was awesome but it was super hard the next day when I went back for my leftovers... so try to finish it when it's still fresh =)
THE BEST SANDWICHES IV'E EVER HAD!!!!!!! I'm from San Diego area and iv'e only been to San Fran twice. The first time i went to San Fran a few years ago, I discovered this place from Man Vs Food (love that show) and I am SO glad I did! I will not go to San Fran without going to Ikes! So yummy! employees are always super awesome there! I really wish there was an Ike's near me! Highly recommend! I want an Ike's sandwich right now!
Overrated.Long waits.Decent sandwiches, A-OK. Definitely not Four or Five stars.I've been coming here for years, but I stopped a couple years ago. Why? Because the last few times I visited, the lines were a bit too insane. Life's too short, why spend it in line?
Ike's place is sandwich royalty, something bigger than just itself. There is something magical about these sandwiches. Come try one. Any one at all, and you will understand.
Always busy, but always so delicious. Dutch Crunch bread is bommmb.I wish there were one in San Diego, just one so I can feast... but then again, I'm happy no one else has it so it becomes one of my celebratory foods when I come back home. :)
I have taken many of friends from San Diego to this place to grab sandwiches and hangout at Dolores Park on a Sunday afternoon, and so far, everyone has loved it. I always get the Matt Cain and the Spiffy Tiffy and share amongst 2-3 other people. The portions are huge and they really know how to make really tasty sandwiches. I have been to Ike's during prime time, and have waited up to 30 minutes in line before. But there have also been times where I didn't have to wait at all. MUST TRY. And for those of you in the East Bay, there is a location in Oakland as well!
Visiting one of my friends in SF and he had to take us to Ike's.I had lofty expectations for sure after seeing the 5000+ reviews with a 4.5 star rating.Definitely lived up to the hype! SOOOO GOOD.I've had Which Wich down in SoCal (maybe they have that up north?) but it doesn't even compare...I ordered the Matt Cain and it also came with a bag of chips (my trip was like 2 months ago so I don't remember; just remembered to review this place now). Matt Cain was a delicious sandwich. Whatever sauce they put in there with the bread that I can't even remember what its called but its the popular one.Maybe the most unhelpful review but I had to give it 5 stars and my 2 cents.
Dutch crunch bread was delicious! But the sandwich itself was just alright. I finally had the chance to try Ike's and was sadly disappointed. I think this was the case because my expectations for Ike's was really high especially from all the hype it has received. I might give it another chance.
Birthday free sandwich!!! The vibe is so welcoming in here. Great service and good feedback from employees when you don't know exactly what you want. The employees are very organized and it works well with their infamous rushes, it works like an assembly line. I LIKE LIKE LOVE.
The new location isn't as nice as the previous location; there are limited seats, and the building is smaller and older. There are also no tables, so if you come with a big group, you'll probably have to eat somewhere else*. However, I don't really care about all this because it's Ike's sandwiches that matter!I always get the [Name of the Girl I'm Dating] on dutch crunch bread, and omgggggggggg I LOVE IT! I think it's the sauces that make Ike's sandwiches stand out. Mmmmmmmm. Even though it costs ~$12, I think it's worth it once in a while, and it definitely fills me up.*About 0.4mi away is Dolores Park! It's a great place to eat your sandwich! There's a BIG uphill to get to the part of the park that has the nice view of the city, but... THE VIEW IS WORTH IT! And you'll be burning off the calories that you'll be shortly consuming.
If you live in SF and haven't been to this place you missed a lot! I highly recommend that you check this place out. Absolutely delicious sandwiches!! They have unique combinations, great sauces, and high quality products. Two things to be aware of:1) There is a very limited seating area, so take-out is the best option. 2) Generally the line is long. So don't assume this will be your quick and easy sandwich pick-up option. Budget at least 30 minutes for ordering and picking up your food.
Menage a Trois is all I ever got and it is so amazing!
Delicious sandwiches on the existing menu and more added every week! Such savvy social media presence and they give you a free sammie on your birthday. Love it to the moon and back
Ike's has the best sandwiches! That's what people tell me....I finally had a chance to try the awesomeness couple months ago. No it's not the best, it's beyond the best!I got The Name of the Girl I'm Dating on dutch crutch and it was literally nothing else I could find on this planet kind of good!Ike's is a bit out of the way for me, and I waited 45-min with an empty stomach while watching people carrying bags and bags of sandwiches out of the place, but the wait was worth every second. Maybe bring some snacks with you while you wait though.
I had their sandwich twice when i went to visit my girlfriend in san francisco. It's delicious but pricy. but at the end of the day, this place attracts a lot of visitors since they have been featured on TV and have a lot of baseball players eat there..
While the food may be tasty, the service was horrible. Waited 45 minutes (after being told it would only be 15 minutes), only to have a random security guard working outside telling people they couldn't sit anywhere near the entrance ask "is your food not ready yet?" He checked, and found out they had to fry up the mozzarella sticks, but didn't tell us; we got our food about 5 minutes after that. Then, even though we ordered 3 subs, we only got 2. Somebody offered to give us a 3rd for free, but we were already running late (as we told them earlier), so had to leave.
This place is THE best sandwich place I have ever been too, no lie. Afterall, how does a sandwich shop get 4.5 stars with 5000+ reviews. Must be the crack in their ingredients! Unfortunately I'm not from SF otherwise I'd be here more often to try other choices but I opted for the "Name of Girl I'm Dating" sandwich (Avocado, Halal Chicken, Honey Mustard, Pepper Jack). This thing was packed with goodness and they didn't skimp on the ingredients. The sauce was the kicker and I have to get my hands on that recipe. I refused to give my real GF more than one bite, maybe I should trade her in for this sandwich...keeps me happy and tastes good? LOL JK GF! There are no tables and limited seating around the sides. But SF has so much to offer, stop wasting your time inside of a sandwich shop.The jalapeno chips were a great compliment. They do have a wide assortment of other chips so give them all a try if you are lucky enough to eat here that many times!PLEASE OPEN A LOCATION IN LA/OC! Hint: Order online and pick up to avoid the lines.
I'm really picky about my sandwiches and this is not one of my favorite sandwich shops. I really don't see what the hype is about. If it's their sauce, I really don't taste what's so special about their sauce. I do not like how their meat is all mushed up, taste like I'm eating a sushi roll (not that sushi is bad or anything). The bread wasn't the way I liked it. I like my bread toasted into something crunchy and yet still soft.I would not go out of my way to go here for a quick fix of sandwich.I love the people that work there and I love the location. (+2)I love that a bag of chips are complimentary. (+1)
Overrated and overpriced.Yeah - I can make what the dog barfed up tasty too if I put enough gooey, lardo, cholesterol infused dirty sauce on it.When they do your autopsy it's what they're gonna find blocking your aorta. I can handle just about anything but never feel so great in the gastro after one of these extremist intestinal plugs.Head down the street to M & L Market.
Ok, this place is a real hole in the wall, BUT the sandwiches are creative and really good! HUGE portions, so plan for that. I would consider this a 'to-go' place, because there is really no seating.
Sandwiches galore! If you're being indecisive, there's certainly something for you at Ike's.With tips from a friend, we actually called in our order for pick-up which was ready in about 30 minutes.  Please check website for a myriad of options! Upon walking in, you'll see two lines -- one to order, and one for pick up. The one to order was moving at a fairly glacial pace, not to mention the wait time for the sandwich to be ready. Not a problem if you're in no particular rush...I ordered the Nacho Boy on sourdough and could not be happier. The bread was crispy and chewy, stacked with fresh meat and avocado and was one of the more satisfying sandwiches I've had. Certainly couldn't finish it in one sitting; made for a great midnight snack.
Ike, Ike, Ike, I LOVE IKE'S SANDWICHES! Simple devine!! Worth the wait, worth the lines, worth the sandwich! When you take a bit into Ike's sandwich, you will realize what you've been missing out your entire life! I don't even like sandwiches that much, but when I had a bite of Ike's sandwich, I realized that I was right!! I don't like sandwiches, but I DO LIKE IKE'S SANDWICHES! Will definitely come back.
THE. BEST. SANDWICH. PLACE. I'VE. EVER. TRIED. Seriously!! When we got there, I was too full to eat again but luckily my boyfriend ordered a sandwich named "Let's Just Be Friends" or something like that. Omg. It was on point. I wish I could go back and get some more! Apparently, the lines get long and it's super busy but when we got there it wasn't busy at all. There were about 2 groups ahead of us and we got our sandwiches within 15 minutes. As for the seating arrangements, the restaurant doesn't have any tables and chairs (there are some chairs to sit and wait for your sandwich) so we went to dolores park and enjoyed our sandwiches there!
HERE IS A HUGE GRIPE!while the full menu is online, AT the store itself there is only about 20 sandwiches listed on the board - when I asked to see a full menu to make my selection, the counter guy said they don't list them, and that I should look it up on my smart phone - "UMMM, hey guy not everyone has a smart phone, so would it be THAT DIFFICULT to have a couple printed paper (or paper laminated) FULL menus for people to view?? " (I looked it up as of 2012 only 50% of people have smartphones) I don't think so...in fact I know so --dummies. Just based on the stupidity of that decision alone I will never go back. what restaurant doesn't have a full menu listed - I mean I get secret menu (like In & Out) but just to be too lazy to have a full menu...it doesn't make any sense, especially when you get soooooo much free press and exposure about your crazy sandwich fixins'
Though Ike's will NEVER compare to my neighborhood Deli- Roxies, it is VERY delicious! I don't recall which sandwich I had because they pride themselves on having each sandwich accompanied by a cool name.Ike's was delivered for a meeting I was attending. I had heard great things about them so I was excited to see what they were all about. Most importantly it was really good! The flavors works well together. TIP: Avoid lunch hour AT ALL CAUSE- unless you call in your order in the morning- this spot is a mad house!I won't go out my way to go to Ike's but If I am in the neighborhood and in want of a deli, I'd swing by there.
that hotttt mommmmmmaaaaa is the best in the world with the mozzarella i swear i can get eat it all ths time
Not a sandwich girl myself but this place has now completely changed my mind! I love their sandwiches!!! I wish they had a sit down dining area though. I had the backstabber which had some artichokes in it...game changer for sure. They need an Ike's in more cities!
Officially my favorite sandwich place.The go-to is the Elvis Keith (Halal chicken, swiss, teriyaki, wasabi mayo) on Dutch Crunch. BOMB. But, frankly, you'll be hella good with any choice.The sandwiches currently range from around $9-$14, but trust that their creations are worth it.What you must know:1) Parking likely won't happen, which explains why I only get to go when I'm on foot around the area.2) Lineup and lookup to decide what you want while you wait. Don't forget your type of bread and any extra ingredients you might like. Then, at the register, choose a bag of chips, which comes with each samich order.3) It's takeout, so while there are seats in the waiting area, there aren't any tables.4) Please don't hangout in the neighbors' driveways or doorways to eat. If you paid for a $10+ samich, don't start being ghetto right after.5) When you get your order, the Blow Pop's complimentary and is in the bag on purpose, so don't think it's a random from a maker who didn't want it. Surprise!
Oh man, I never understood why people love sandwiches so much..until now.PARKING: Street parking. I would suggest going early (around 10AM) because I had no trouble parking then!FOOD: I ordered the Hollywood's SF Cheesesteak. It was the perfect blend of protein, veggies, and carbs in one delicious wrapper of Dutch Crunch bread. Seriously, this sandwich is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had in my life. My friends ordered the Menage a Trois, which they said lived up to the hype of Yelp (what ever does!?). There's definitely something magical in their spread!WAIT: This place is notorious for their long wait, so we decided to order ahead by phone and schedule a pick up. We came by on a Sunday morning, and there were only a couple people ahead of us. I would suggest ordering ahead of time to get the best service!Does this compare to Earl of Sandwich? Maybe. Is this a must-go if you're ever in the city? YES!
Why am I the outlier here?Ikes is okay. Simply okay. It reminds me of Fat Sals... but smaller sandwiches that cost more. I ordered a Jim Rome, which my friends berated me for, saying it wasn't that adventurous... and regretted it. The bread ripped the roof of my mouth raw, the cheddar wasn't melted and tasted like thick Kraft slices and the Avocado had no preparation of flavor... it was bland. How are you a sandwich shop in CA and the majority of your sandwich have avocado, but you can't properly prepare it?My husband had the Jessica Rabbit and loved the vegan chicken and jalapeno poppers, but thought the sauce was terrible and picked his way through the sandwich. We heeded your reviews and ordered for pick-up to avoid the mayhem but I certainly won't return, convenient order or not. Word on the street has it they're opening in LA. Good luck...
5 stars. No question about it.Yes, I'm rating this place 5 stars, and yes, as a previous reviewer predicted, I do wear skinny jeans (slim straight actually). But, that doesn't make me dishonest does it? Ike's has been, without a doubt, the best sandwich shop I have ever had the pleasure of eating at. I frequent Ike's Lair in Cupertino, but have been to Ike's Place a couple times before. The menu board shows different sandwiches depending on each Ike's location, but the most popular sandwiches are all there. Ask for the full menu if you want to look through all 300+ sandwiches.I've tried every sandwich on the menu board at Ike's lair and a bunch off the menu as well. Best one I've tried so far is the Don't F- With Elvis Keith. I make it my goal to try at least one new sandwich (yes I often get more than one) every time I visit an Ike's, and I highly suggest you do too if you visit more than once. Yes, I've had other sandwiches. I am quite the sandwich connoisseur, if you asked me. Eat here as much as you can, before you, like me, move to LA, and are left with only memories... If anyone finds another sandwich place as good, better, or even slightly worse than Ike's in LA please let me know.
Amazing sandwiches!I had the change -- ribeye, lettuce, cheddar, bbq sauce on dutch crunch. Just amazing, I wish I had some right now.My bf had the Kryptonite -- HUGE sandwich. They even wrap it separately. It had salami, turkey, roast beef, pastrami, bacon, ham, guacamole, pesto, bell pepper poppers, mozzarella sticks, lettuce, tomatoes. It was delicious as well!I would definitely go back!
MY FIRST TIME HERE!!!!!!!!!I've heard so much hype about this place (and the long lines) so I've always hesitated on coming. I came here on a Sunday to meet a gf for lunch. Man, the lines were horrendously long... so long that it wrapped around. I waited about 30 minutes before I got to order. We got the SF Giants (turkey, avocado, bacon and mushrooms). It was super yummy. We ordered and walked over to Dolores Park to enjoy our sandwiches since it was such a nice day. Price: Our sandwich was $11.50? I felt like it was a bit steepish for what we got. I appreciate the fresh ingredients, but the sandwiches are much smaller than Mr. Pickles and Little Lucas. Overall, it's definitely worth a try but come during a non-busy hour. Or, if you are in a rush, it's probably not a good idea. :)
Delicious sandwiches and staff is excellent.
Name Of Girl I'm Dating was the name of my sandwich - a wonderful combination of fresh whole grain bread, pulled chicken and avocado. THEY SELL CHEERWINE! Being a North Carolina native, I was truly impressed by that. When the cashier found out we were from NC he was in awe. "I've heard that Cheerwine is actually a fountain drink there!" Ha funny. Love Ike's. I'll be back.
Everyone kept raving about this place so I tried it during my trip to SF. We got the Kryptonite sandwich and it was waaaaay too much for two people. It is around $20 for two HUGE sandwiches. There is all types of meat inside and was quite delicious for the first couple bites but then it got a little salty and we had an entire sandwich leftover, which turned soggy soon after.
Dont need a reason to be here!! Their SFO one was the best! But having opened in San Jose,Santa Clara as well is a boon."Sometimes I am a vegetarian" and "Sesame Street" are the best for Vegetarians like me! With their secret sauce(!) and fresh veggies, it could'nt have got any better!
Bottom line: VEGANS SKIP IT. Not impressed. I understand waiting in line. I live in SF, I get it. Stoner food for $14.00 - GIMME A BREAK.Was hanging out near here and wanted to give this place a try, since it hit on the vegan lists of 7x7. Waited in line for 40 min+, scoured the menu for what I wanted.Confusion: there are 3 menus. WHY? 1) There are the menus posted on the board when you walk into the restaurant. Gee, that's nice for the outline of whats avail.2) There's the yelp menu. Gee, that's nice if you read yelp, you'll find some other yummy menu items avail.3) There's the super secret menu that's made up of nintendo word if you google IKES secret menu? WHY? Not even cool.So, I ordered the Wario, which was mozz sticks, vegan meatballs and marina. Good stuff! FOURTEEN DOLLARS? NO EFFING WAY. That was at most a $8.00 sando. So, if you're into finding something that's stonerific, overpriced and a horrendous wait, go here. Otherwise, I'm sure you can find a better restaurant that's got better food in the area. I saw a vietnamese sando place that I'd gladly give my money to at this point.Bottom line: VEGANS SKIP IT.
I gave a four stars for the delicious sandwich, it's the first time I finished the whole loaf of sandwich by myself and it's a huge loaf. The best thing about the sandwich would be its special house sauce. The first lady who served me was really nice and then the one after not so much. When you are snobby in the food service, people remembers.
My first Menage A Trois was at Ikes and it was AMAZING!If you love yourself a nice big all american sandwich, this is where you want to be.I can wait to try everything else on the menu!
I love ike's place a ridiculous amount. Really like that extra dirty sauce.
The sandwiches are filling, but not all that impressed with the prices. Still it was nice to try it out.
The sauce and the bread are just amazing. Almost doesn't matter what you ask them to put inside the sandwich. As long as you get the Dutch Crunch Bread and their delicious sauces!
I had the Matt Cain, not a chicken fan. The bread alone is worthy of a visit, the gritty atmosphere may not be for everyone but your going to get it to go anyway. Loved the Godfather sauce, I suggest a carryout on the way to SFO. I did and was off the ground long before the plane! YUM
Dayumatic (Sp? it's like damn + dynamic put together) -- however it is spelled, it is amazing. It's the most ridiculous sandwich I have ever had and is probably the reason why I am now seeking a new gym membership. The sandwich is actually two sandwiches and is practically everything but the kitchen sink. From memory... it has fried chicken, fried chicken steak, meatballs, bacon, potato chips (yes in the sandwich), honey, yellow bbq sauce... there has got to be more meat in there that I forgot about. The thing is about $20.No fries served here anymore so those pics from back in the day are misleading :( Ike's does have uniquely flavored potato chips. But honestly who needs chips when you have all the flavor you need? :)
If there were 3.5 stars, I'd probably give it that, but I'm defaulting to three because with all the hype, I expected more out of my sandwich. The sandwich was good, but I've had equally good, if not better tasting sandwiches elsewhere. Things I like:-This place is open and shows you the whole sandwich making process (you can look into their kitchen) -They seem hip and promote health awareness (there's a sign @ the cash register that tells you to get tested for STDs every 6 months)-People working there are nice and seem to know the regularsThings I wasn't so stoked about:-So I ordered the Name of the Girl I'm Dating and my boyfriend ordered the Matt Cain -- both on the dutch rolled. The dutch roll was VERY good. If they sold bread like that, I would buy a loaf of it. However, the sandwich itself felt heavy. The sauce is supposed to be the best part of the sandwich, but it was overwhelming to me.--Portion size was big. For others, this may be a good thing, but neither my boyfriend nor I felt good after each finishing off the sandwich (yes, I know -- a little bit our fault, but it would be nice if they made it smaller and a little cheaper). Because it was so saucy, we didn't feel like it was something that could be saved for later. --The wait took awhile. However, I learned (once we got there) that you could order online and go and pick up.)Chances are, I won't be coming back for awhile since this place is out of my way and I didn't think it was really worth it. But if/when I do come back, I'll be ordering online and probably splitting something with the boyfriend.
I've only been to Ike's once, but it is NOT disappointing. It is ooh ooh goodness! I ordered the Sequoia Raven and the BBQ sauce was just right. Not too sweet and not too tangy. I went to the Foster City location, which gets pretty busy during lunch. It took about 15 minutes for my co workers and I to get our food. The location is really small and can be cramped if you're planning to dine inside. The prices are relative to the quality and the size is a good portion. I say its a MUST TRY.
I couldn't believe my taste buds when I had the menage a trois with extra dirty sauce!!! I can't wait to go back!!!!
Never again.I told the bf to never again let me finish an entire Ike's sandwich in one night. True story. I ate the first half of my Nacho Boy on Dutch around 5:30pm and held off on the remainder, hoping my stomach would growl again later, when I could then polish off the rest. Four hours rolled by, and I could withstand the hold off no longer, despite really not even being hungry. I, now in sweatpants (thank God), cannot move and don't even want to think about eating again for the next 72 hours.So I write this review, stuffed and asking myself why I couldn't just save that second half for lunch tomorrow - it's not like it would have disappeared had I waited (hindsight truly is always 20/20, I suppose)!! I guess this is just true testament to how deliciously amazing Ike's sandwiches are. And you know what? No regrets.
bomb bomb BOMB sandwiches! I've tried several of their sandwiches, and they're all good (including the veggie ones). Their bread & sauces I think are really what make the sandwiches great.
Ton of food for not much money, and the sandwiches always taste great, but the bread here makes me feel icky. Not sure why. I'm not super sensitive to gluten, but places like this might make too many people think they are.
Just visited here yesterday and I ordered the Jaymee Shire, a fried chicken sandwich. It was delicious but after tasting a different chicken sandwich (that was vegan) the flavors seemed to be so similar that I couldn't tell the difference. It's basically a ton of stuff jammed in between two yummy yummy yummy ( did I say yummy?) slices of Dutch crunch bread. That bread was much appreciated as was the dill flavored chips! I order a drink which they forgot to give me but hey no big deal. The salt vinegar chips were also a good choice to munch on whole you wait. I would come again but I think ill try the Oakland location since it's closer. It's a famous and trendy spot so if you're in the area swing by!!!
If you love to wait in line come here. Only one person working at the register. They are more focused on the people calling than the ones already here. Please hire more help for the registers. Also the bathroom is in the worst possible place against the wall where the huge line is. This will be my last time here this place needs a huge face lift.
Oh Ike. Your Kryptonite sandwich left me in a food coma, but I had a good time eating it!After seeing this place on TV and reading all the Yelp reviews, I finally tried Ike's. Since it was my first time, I decided to go for it and get the Kryptonite. What isn't on this sandwich?! All the fatty goodness melted in my mouth and left me wanting more. My only complaint is that by the time I got home the sandwich had cooled down so the mozzarella sticks and jalapeno poppers weren't nice and melty. Otherwise, I can't wait to come back and try some other sandwiches!
the dutch crunch was definitely the best I've ever had. I'll be back just for that. great turkey avoc too!I've been wanting to come here for years, but what I really didn't like was that they didn't have their menu out anywhere! It's only online?!
Just omg... I got the Matt Cain and it was sooo good. Ate it on top of Dolores Park, and totally killed my appetite for the rest of the day.
Ok ok ok. You win. I went. I ate. I lost my mind. Any other sandwich will taste like a salad on bread now and it's all Ike's fault. Damn u Ike. Damn u.
Wow, after many years and hearing everything about this place, I finally had the chance to try it out and it was not disappointing at all - amazing, fantastic sandwiches! I've had a couple recently and they were both full-flavored and perfectly created.My first sandwich was a "Paul Reubens", which was a masterpiece of pastrami, coleslaw and Swiss cheese. Paired with a fresh Dutch Crunch roll, this was an excellent sandwich with a perfect proportion of meat/filling and bread. My second sandwich was the "Going Home For Thanksgiving", which was great for those who want that turkey dinner flavor and don't want to wait until Thanksgiving.  This had a hefty portion of nicely flavored turkey breast, cranberry sauce and Havarti cheese. Again, it went perfectly with the Dutch Crunch roll.This place really is excellent and I'd recommend anyone to visit. The last two times I've been there, there was not really a line, although a bit of a wait, which makes sense considering everything is made fresh. It's also a nice touch that each sandwich order includes your choice of chips!
I was totally bummed out by my recent visit here. I rarely get out to SF but when I do, I always stop by Ike's Place because their sandwiches are like none other. This is why it was bad this time:- I called ahead as they said it'd be 35+ mins for a to go order but if I came in, it'd be a lot faster. That didn't quite make sense to me - the sandwiches I ordered were $2 more than it showed online. When I asked if the website had up to date pricing, they said yes. When asked why mine were an additional $2, they said that there was some updating that may not have completed. And by the way the board behind the register had the same pricing as online. -the famous Dutch crunch bread which I considered to be my favorite sandwich shop bread of all time was kind of stale this time around -the sandwich called "Change" was shockingly flavorless. Couldn't take the meat at all.After paying $29 for two sandwiches, it was just utterly disappointing. Need to hunt for a new sandwich spot in SF now.
Ike's popped my cherry when it came to sammiches! Before Ike's Ive only had bush league saNDwiches - [Bay cities, Busy bees, Philippes, Oinkster, Mendocino Farms]Ike's Ruben's, menage, and just friends all EXTRA DIRTY is all you need to know.+halal chicken for the motherfathering win.+artisan soda pops+go go go
I've been to the Oakland location many times, but I had to come get my fix of Ike's at the OG location in the city!It was a weekday evening so there was no line at all, I ordered my Dan Ashley sandwich and the cashier was telling me it's her favorite and that I'm awesome for ordering it. One thing I really liked about this location is that you already get a bag of Zapp's chips with your purchase and these chips are HELLA GOOD with a sandwich, trust me!Next time when I'm down in the Castro or Mission, I will be back!
Wow. Just wow. My boyfriend and I are from Seattle, but was recommend to come here by a local. We went at about 10:30 on a Thursday, so the line wasn't too terrible - we waited about 30 minutes for our sandwiches, but it was well worth the wait.We both ordered the Spiffy Tiffy and it was AMAZING. There was so much avocado and pesto goodness that combined with the tender halal chicken that made an experience to die for. The mushrooms was a nice vegetable touch to the towering sandwich. We could have ordered just one sandwich. Talk about a bang for your buck. I ate this for lunch AND dinner and I was still blown away by how good it was the second time around.
OK so there are already 5,000+ reviews of this place, so in rare form, I will keep this brief:Why are there no tables? Where am I supposed to eat this HOT sandwich when there is nowhere to dine? I take it home, it's lukewarm. So I'm witnessing these people sit around the perimeter of the store - in the seats that are oddly provided sans tables - eating their massive sandwiches over the paper bags they were given in like slobs. Then I became one such slob. What else am I going to do? I won't take it to go: I don't play that soggy shiz. Also, why are chips included in the price? I'm paying double digts for a flippin' sandwich, and it's already pretty big. Spare me the chips and spare me a dollar. I do appreciate the inch-thick stack of napkins provided. Screw the environment. I need clean hands when I eat! Obviously the sandwich tastes good. I just think Ike's reputation allows him to get away with upcharging (PS - $1 extra to sub in roast beef for ham? I have been swindled). Ike must be some sort of culinary gypsy.
I only eat the Kryptonite. It's the biggest, meanest, and baddest sandwich on the planet in my book. It's also shocking that someone can make something with so many different things (meats, sauces, cheese, veggies, bread, ONION RINGS, etc.) and still taste amazing. There was no clash in flavor throughout the sandwich. WARNING - for those attempting to conquer this feat in one go like I do. Just use the carmel apple pops they hand out as your motivation. Keep telling yourself that you're slowly working towards that sweet candy one bite at a time and it'll help.
I mean, its a sandwich. I came here because of the reviews thinking I was going to experience something awesome. Bottom line is that a sandwich will always be a sandwich and the stuff coming out of Ike's was decent but I would never say to myself that I want a sandwich from Ike's. The dirty sauce is just a rip off from a middle eastern dish and was kinda weird in the sandwich.The 3 stars is for price, wait time (20min from order to my hands), just an okay sandwich (Matt Cain sandwich).Im not trying to be negative. I went out of my way to eat here and I was very excited to try it and really wanted to like it. But 3 stars is as good as it will get for me.
Great sandwiches! Tried the Pilgrim and Captain Kirk- they both hit that perfect spot.
I recently went a trip to the Bay Area and the first thing on my list that I needed to do was get a sandwich from Ike's Place. I've been hearing about this place a lot and all of my friends who live in NorCal suggested that I get a sandwich from this place.I just wanted to try one sandwich and ended up eating three within 18 hours, so that kind of says something. I ordered the Nacho Boy, Pride of Castro, and Paul Reubens all on Dutch Crutch (the only way to go, apparently). You get a lot of food or what you pay for, so it's definitely worth it.The environment threw me off since it was very small and it kind of looked vandalized, but that's just part of the charm at Ike's Place. Also, the employees are super casual and chill, as if you're friends, and that's always a plus in my book. I'd recommend this place to anyone who's a fan of sandwiches, which should be everyone, right? I thought I wouldn't find a place better than Earl of Sandwich, but Ike's definitely gives them a run for their money.I'm definitely making Ike's Place a "must-go-to" place whenever I visit The City.
Five star food, worth the wait....but it's a long wait for a sandwich. I think it took about 40 minutes to get a single order, I went with some friends and my wife - we all split a few sandwiches and I don't think I can say a bad word about them. ANYTHING you order will be amazing.
I frequent this place way too much. Tip: if you want a sandwich during peak lunch hours, CALL FIRST. A little thought and planning will take you a long way. If you show up within the first hour of opening on a weekday, it should be alright. If you want a sandwich on the weekend, around the lunch rush, just call. Any other time off lunch rush is fine.Tip2: This is not a place to sit down and eat your sandwich. Very little seating to go around. Most people use the seating just to wait for their food, then leave. There is a line of chairs against the wall (roughly 4-5) and an extension off the window to sit but that's it. Its better to plan on eating elsewhere.Tip3: Not sure if they still do this, but if you order the sandwich of a Giants pitcher who is starting that day, free drink.FOOD:-No getting around it. The sandwiches are expensive.-Dutch crunch is the bread everyone loses their shit over. Its pretty good but it adds a lot of bulk to the sandwich.-Lincecum, Cain, Bumgarner, Zito, Say Hey, Barry B. SF Cheesesteak, Harrison Barnes, Harbaugh, Kryptonite, Spiffy Tiffy, Jaymee Sire are the ones I've tried. All good. -The 'challenge' sandwiches are fucking huge. Good luck. -Free chips (voodoo chips) and a lollipop with every sandwich. Meh. Honestly it just feels like the price of chips were tacked onto the sandwiches.Great place, good food.
So I put this place on our list of places to go for our SF road trip after a friend suggested it when I asked for a well known sandwich place to go in SF comparable to Paseo's in Seattle. We stopped by here around 10:30 on a Tuesday and there was NO LINE! Score! We chatted with the girl up front and she recommended a few sandwiches and we decided on the Menage trios and the Matt Cain.The sandwiches were HUGE! I made such a comment and the guy next to us kind of chuckled. I think I totally gave away that we were tourists. Anyway, the bf and I split the Matt Cain (roast beef, onions, avacado, a bunch of other stuff) for lunch a bit later on. Totally delicious! Generous amounts of roast beef, avacado, toppings, and the dirty sauce (garlic something sauce) complimented everything perfectly. We were stuffed w/ one sandwich and bag of chips btwn the two of us (each sandwich came w/ a bag of chips; we got jalapeno and salt n vinegar).We saved the other sandwich for the next days lunch and it was still tasty! The menage trios had halal chicken (shredded and seasoned chicken) which went well with the other toppings. The bread was barely soggy after a day and half of sitting (I actually don't mind soggy corners). Yum. I can see why ppl come here. Large portions, good quality meats, friendly service, and tasty sandwiches! 2 sandwiches was about $23ish, but that's actually pretty darn good considering how large the sandwiches are and you get a bag of chips w/ each one. After eating just half a sandwich from here I was satisfied and full. Stop by if you get the chance.
Absolutely F$%#*ING RIDICULOUS!!!! First time, staff recommended the Matt Cain and it was insane. Nuf said.
The food is great. Maybe your stomach hurts a bit after from all the secret sauce but, I always go back for more. Def. not something you eat before doing any physical activities but binge watching a show. Captain Kirk is great for Vegetarians too.
Came here on a Sunday afternoon, there was still a line but it went quickly. I got the "menage a trois" with pickles, special sauce, drink and chips. Sandwich was good. it was satisfying and i ate it all. I did not think it had all that hype, it was a god sandwich but that is it. i would not go there again bc of the long lines and there is no availability for sitting down ..there is some space to sit down but you gotta wait for an avail. there as well... They do have vegetarian and vegan options which is nice.. but overall, the hype was overrated.
Love love love. When the bf suggested Ike's, I wasn't really excited because how good can a sandwich be? Little did I know that Ike's will chang my world. The Dutch crumb bread is cooked to perfection. I had the name the girl you're dating with jalapeos.... And wow. That was the best sandwich I ever had. Each sandwich comes with some dirty sauce that gives the sandwiches a unique kick. Next time, I'll probably ask for extra as recommended by others! Each sandwich also comes with a caramel apple pop and bag of chips. Try the voodoo! It's their best seller for a reason! I mean you know you're doing something right when there are lines outside the door at a random 3pm! Keep it up, Ike's. We will definitely be back!
Okay, so the menu can seem overwhelming at first....That just means you'll have to keep coming back until you try them all! The sandwiches are unique, delicious, and the staff are well aware of allergens to help you avoid them. There is always a line at Ike's, but the good is the line will give you plenty of time to read the menu, and choose your favorite sandwich!
So many great sandwiches with great names (they also taste very good). I think the one I really like is called "The Girl I'm Dating". I'm pretty sure I would like all of them. Believe the hype. This place is amazing!
Does this place need another review? No... but I might as well write one. I happened to spot Ike's Place on my way to somewhere else. I believe it was destiny that brought us together that day!The place is really small, so there isn't really a place for you to sit while enjoying your meal. There was no line inside when I went. I ordered the Mnage a Trois- halal chicken, 3 sauces (real honey, honey mustard, bbq), and 3 cheeses (pepper jack, swiss, cheddar). The sandwich came with a side of chips. I didn't even realize how hungry I was until magically, half my sandwich was gone. The sandwich made my whole trip to SF worth it![As Seen On The Best Thing I Ever Ate and Man v Food]
Wow, best sandwiches EVER! I recommend the #18 "Matt Cain" & the #111! Both were exceptional!
OK, I'm going to join the crowd and clearly say it out loud: best sandwich place in San Francisco. You should be prepared that in peak hours you are going to wait around an hour to get your order. They have no real seating, but Dolores park is just a few blocks away to sit, enjoy the sun and park people with your fantastic sandwich.So just get a Hot Momma Huda, head to Dolores park and pick up a beer on your way.
Best sandwiches in the area!!!With a delicious creamy garlic sauce and big sizes for hungry people!My favorite is the Meatless Mike, suitable for vegetarians :)
I had just gotten home from a flight and the last thing I wanted to do was make something to eat. So I headed out to Ike's for a sandwich.It was my first time, but I decided to go all out: the Doomsday, baby.With roast beef, corned beef, pastrami, salami, turkey, bacon, ham, habanero salsa, mozzarella sticks, stuffed jalapeno poppers, and extra jack on a dutch crunch roll, this ain't no joke. (Note: I omitted the turkey--because I don't eat animals with wings, it's weird, but whatever, get over it. It's good to know they can omit certain ingredients.) Anyway, at $19.91, this isn't cheap, but if you're feeding a family of four--WHICH THIS SANDWICH COULD TOTALLY DO--it's a steal!I was asked to wait about 10 minutes for it to be ready. So I walked over to the library, checked out a Murakami book, came back for the sandwich, grabbed a Diet Cheerwine (yes, they have diet Cheerwine!) and went home to eat. (I can't think of a more perfect way to welcome myself back home.)I would've taken a photo of the monstrosity, but I just HAD to take a bite first; and once that went down, well, the only thing I could pick up and not care about staining was a napkin.Also: love the lollies you get with the sandwich. I got two caramel apple lollipops. Yep, two. Thanks for thinking this sandwich was for two people, guys. Yep, don't feel like a fat-ass AT ALL.
Wow. There's something in the bread here (Dutch crunch?) that doesn't exist on the East Coast. The sandwiches are incredible, delicious and filling (but on the pricey side). We had four people order sandwiches, a bag of chips and three bottle sodas and the total was over $60. This is a bit high for lunch. But the food was good and we called our order in, so we didn't have to wait in line. Definitely worth the trip if you're willing to splurge for a yummy sandwich! Oh, also, nowhere to eat inside, so be prepared to take it home or have a picnic somewhere!
My boyfriend and I got the Matt Cain and Menage trois. We both like the Menage trois but our favorite is the Matt Cain. It was savory... That sauce is heavenly! Their house bread, Dutch crunch, went really well with both our sandwiches. We both also enjoyed the free chips that came with the sandwiches. We took our sandwiches to Delores park and had a nice little picnic with like 100 other people doing the same thing. Lol We decided that out of all our meals during our 3 days in SF, Ike's place was our favorite. So would I recommend this place to others? Heck yes!!!
Roll into Ike's expect a bit of a line, but don't worry it is worth it.Get yourself a Lincecum, which will satisfy the greatest lunch time hunger pangs and lead you to an epic stomach symphony of awesomeness.Ike's is becoming an institution here in San Francisco and rightly so. The fresh baked bread, hearty sandwiches topped to the brim and has the most important ingredient for a popular place in SF... a HUGE LINE TO WAIT IN. People here love lines, so just go with it.You'll love it.
Ok, Ike's has won me over. I'm not sure if the long lines are justified, but they've got some good sandwich options, and they have done a good job trying to control the lines and customers who throw trash around the neighborhood. Good option for calling ahead and picking something up for lunch.
I've had many sandwiches and they're all delicious. The sauces make it and don't forget the Voodoo chips!
I had this (name of the girl I'm dating) 3 years ago while on a trip to SF and still crave it. That's how good this place is. Ike, some day we will meet again and I will be a happy woman.
Great sandwiches. Had one with onion rings thinly sliced rib eye on the special bread with special sauce. Very yummy. My only problem with the place is cleanliness. If it didn't have such high reviews I would've walked right out. I managed a restaurant before and would've been fired if my restaurant was even a forth as dirty as there's. If they want to expand and become more of a chain they definitely will need to develop cleaning systems. The dirtiest in customers view was the outside of the trash can, floors, and stainless in the kitchen lots of debris on the floor. But the sandwiches were so good I would go again...
Ike's is my go to when I am on a walk and think about sandwiches an hour before I want them. There is an overwhelming menu of choices, but you can't really go wrong with any of the options already on the menu. Dutch Crunch is my favorite bread, so put that with anything you order. Just make sure to call ahead and get an estimate of how long it'll take.
All aboard the hype machine.Still haven't gotten over all the 4 and 5 star reviews people give places on yelp and Ike's is no different. More like out of town people watching food network. If it really warrants 4 or 5 stars I would not have had this conversation with my wife recently:Me: We need to try Ike's sometimeWife: We have and it was no big deal, messy and a little priceyMe: What did we haveWife: I don't remember but we didn't like either sandwich that muchIf that sounds like a 4 or 5 star experience then go for it. If you are in the neighborhood you won't go wrong - it is not bad by any means. Just don't go out of your way for it or rate it highly unless it was mind blowing and made you weak in the knees.
This isn't your typical sandwich! I'm crazy for Ike's sandwiches! I usually get the Matt, Cain menage de tois, Damon Bruce and name of the girl I'm dating. You can't go wrong with any sandwich! I've had a vegetarian one (soy meatballs) and it was ok. Not something I would get because I would crave for it but I couldn't eat meat since it was during lent and it was on a Friday and it wasn't that bad. The godfather sauce is just tremendous! I normally don't eat roast beef but in the Matt Cain it just melts in your mouth and you get hooked! I've gotten a few of my friends hooked on Ike's since I first went in 2011. I recommend this place to everyone. It's small so you have to take it to go. Parking can be a drag here but it is well worth it for this place! Service is friendly and I've never had a problem here. I came about once a month here all the way from Richmond for an Ike's sandwich, but since the Oakland one has opened, I go there now. Reasonable prices but seems like Funky Chips have been taken away =(Tip: Make sure you call it on so you don't have to wait in like ordering your food or waiting for them to make your sandwich!If you want a great fill up sandwich then come check this place out!!!!
You can order your sandwich through the iPhone app to save time when you pick it up, although when we came by, there wasn't much of a line at that time. The sandwich is pretty good. I remember getting a Matt Cain (Godfather Sauce, Provolone, Roast Beef, Salami, Turkey). It was good, but it was $10. I think I ate only half though given how humongous the sandwich was. Barely any seats on this place, so it's really more of a to go type of sandwich place. Even though it's a little pricey for me, I still recommend at least trying it once. I'm still planning to get a Doomsday sandwich one of these days, maybe after I run a marathon.
this place is just as good as everyone says! A local recommended this place and it was well worth the wait!
Just an outright unique sandwich shop in the Castro district of San Francisco which for us out-of-towners was a very unique but very good experience the lines can get a little bit long but the sandwich is well worth it!my only complaint is that the sandwich is fantastic eating but there is really no where to eat it!no tables no benches Etc...
I came to SF to see a friend for the weekend and Ike's was definitely one of the local spots I just had to visit while I was up there. Ike's definitely lives up to the expectations and delivers great sandwiches at a reasonable price. The outside is distinguished by the classic Ike's charicature logo with big clear windows. The inside doesn't look like a typical sandwich deli, but rather gives off a small gastro pub ambiance. They also have a broad selection of awesome sandwiches and chips that compliment one another. My friend and I came on a late Saturday afternoon and found the place to be packed with a line of hungry customers (pro-tip: order by phone or app ahead of time to beat the rush!). Still, the wait wasn't half bad and the Hot Momma Huda I ordered made it all worth it. The sandwich contains hulal chicken with buffalo sauce, ranch, and provalone cheese. Needless to say, it was everything I expected and more. The chicken was moist and the sauces definitely played well together in the sandwich. My friend and I walked a few blocks to a local park to sit and enjoy our sandwiches since there is limited seating inside of Ike's. The walk helped me digest the sandwich, but I literally had to stop by again and order a second one after passing by on our way back to the car. NO REGRETS!So if you're ever in SF and need your sandwich fix, come to Ike's and try one of their modestly portioned sandwiches. Go with the Doomsday if you're feeling tough.
Been to Ike's a few times and still trying to find the best vegetarian sandwich. Ike's is pretty good but there prices run a little high, sandwiches are about $9-$11 dollars and no longer come with free chips. There Dutch crunch bread is always dankie. I split the 'I'm sometimes vegetarian' -with added jalapeo poppers & the meatball something I don't remember the name... Both were good but neither stellar. Don't get me wrong, Ike's has very yummy sandwiches and good portion sizes but I'm always looking for a little something more every time I go.
Came here with my bf late afternoon on a Sunday and it wasn't packed at all. The service was very speedily. We were in n out of there in less than 10 minutes. I ordered the "Going Home for Thanksgiving" and my bf got "The Damon Bruce" both on Ike's famous Dutch Crunch & an order of fries. The fries were too soft for my liking, maybe because they're baked instead of fried, so I wouldn't order them again.. But O-M-G their sandwiches are AMAZEBALLS! The one I ordered was literally like a party in my mouth.. Turkey, cranberry sauce, sriracha & Havarti cheese. Also added avocados to it and it was perfection! I had a bite of The Damon Bruce as well and it was very good! We took them to-go and ate them on Hippie Hill at the Golden Gate Park, which is about 10 minutes away, and enjoyed the beat of the drum circle while chowing down on our sandwiches. My tummy was surely happy and full. Oh, and they also throw in caramel apple lollipops for a little dessert :) I'll definitely be returning to Ike's when I come back to visit SF!
YUM YUM YUM sandwiches and a million options!! I love the special sauce. DEFINITELY call in your order and pick it up. Be prepared for a 15 minutes wait even when picking up if you order at a prime mealtime. Worth the wait. Also very worth the price I think. 1 sandwich is almost enough to split.
BEST SANDWHICHES IN THE WHOLE FUCKING WORLD. Like no wonder there's always a damn line. Thank goodness for call ahead ordering and ordering online through Facebook. Always get the Dutch Crunch bread. My favs are: Name of The Girls I'm Dating, and off-the-menu Desperate Housewife sub fried chicken for the Halal. Literally the only two I've ever eaten in the last year because they are just so good it's ridiculous.
Oh Ike's Place... If your line wasn't so crazy all the time and your call-in wait wasn't so long I'd probably come here more often. Not gonna lie though, this place is good. I remember when I first tried Ike's they were at their old location down the street, Ike himself delivered my first sandwich! It was like meeting a celebrity. You get a serious bang for your buck: Huge Sandwich of your choice, bag of chips, and a lollipop. Cute Ike, real cute. I've tried a couple of sandwiches here:Menage A Trois - halal chicken, honey, honey mustard, bbq, pepper jack, swiss, cheddarBackstabber - halal chicken, marinated artichoke hearts, caesar, provoloneJayme Sirewich - ranch, pepper jack, chicken fried chicken, ikes yellow bbqCan't really decide on a fave because they're all so unique and good! Tip: Phone in your order a good hour or so before you plan to eat, that way you won't have to wait when you're dying of hunger.
What can I say but the best sandwiches you'll ever have. As a vegetarian, they've really got it covered. A bit pricey but worth it. They could certainly learn to speed up the service a bit, when it comes to making the sandwiches. I really wish they had tables but this location doesn't have room for tables and I like where they are and wouldn't want them moving for table space, unless they could stay in the same hood. I would certainly love to see them open a couple more locations in The City. How about one in the Inner Sunset, Ike?
Worth the wait and every penny!!! Try the Backstabber, so good!!!
Not your usual gourmet sub. A little more delicious. A little more over the top.Tip: Phoning in ahead is a good move unless you like wasting Sunday morning in a line.
The Menage a Trois is seriously my crack... another fave is the Count of Monte Chase-o.Enjoy eating your sandwich in Dolores Park with the entertaining hipsters. Truly an SF MUST!
Finally got a chance to try out Ike's place. It had been on my bookmarks for a while now.Getting to the point. I tried the Matt Cain and it was exceptional. For $11, I go the sandwich and a packet of Chips. The taste was exceptional. The only thing that I didn't like was that they had too many great sandwiches on their menu but I could only try one. Since I am distant from this place, it may be a while when I try out another of their classic sandwiches but hopefully the experience will bring me back soon.
Line is pretty long, but it's worth the wait. SO GOOD. Probably my favorite sandwich place. I got the Cain sandwich and tried a bite of my friends'. Such great flavors!
Somebody should go egg the (now) ex-neighbors. If you're going to get jealous of a successful business, MTFO.I hate how it's at a bar. Things don't run as smoothly anymore since they're only allowed to occupy a small corner of the room.I mean, praise Lime for allowing Ike's to stay. It's closer to the MUNI station, which is awesome.
Staff is always friendlySandwiches are huge and messy and very good!I recommend sharingIf u wait to eat it later it will be soggy but prolly still goodI take all my outtowners hereThis is not a sit down place to eatU can order your sandwich over the phone and pick it up. It will be faster.All there sandwiches are good, just depends on what your craving for
Some friends were visiting and they really wanted to get Ike's so we decided to meet up at the original Castro location.At first overwhelmed by the huge list but calmed down in line. The line was so long we had way too much to decide. Everyone ended up ordering the same thing: Spiffy Tiffy's. Spiffy Tiffy's consist of chicken, avocado, mushrooms, and a cheese that I don't remember. I just know that it was very tasty. They changed up the place a little. It's more spacious now that they moved the chip boxes to the back behind the registers. They have a few more chip choices too which I find to be exciting. I liked the tomato basil one. It tasted like tomato soup in the form of a chip. Great sandwiches.
Very good savory sandwiches. Grab a sandwich from Ike's, walk over to Dolores park, and enjoy the goodness.Good plan for a nice sunny afternoon in San Francisco.
So yummy!
I don't really have anything to add that hasn't been said before. This place was pretty awesome. So awesome in fact that on a 6 day trip to San Francisco this place was good enough that we ate here twice. It probably would have been more than that if we had found out about Ike's more than two days before we left. Thankfully we came mid-week so the line was very minimal, if at all, but there were always people in there. I'm really not much of a sandwich person, but this place changed my mind. Their sourdough bread is mind-blowing...and I hate sourdough. The fact that they offer a full length menu of vegetarian options makes it a great option for carnivores to veg-heads a like. My guy isn't a vegetarian and even he was pretty blown away by the breaded vegetarian chicken. We tried it two ways.....first in the Blind Date, then in a mock chicken-parmigiana sandwich that I can't remember the name of. But holy cow balls it was good. Honestly, you could put just about anything on that bread and it would be delicious. The voodoo chips sealed the deal for me too.
I'll admit it: The only reason Ike's made it into my bookmark archive is because of the Man v. Food program. Indeed, I often bite that hook very easily, often knowing that Adam Richmond has likely baited me with a bill of goods that are grossly overrated. I'm pleased to say, however, that Ike's managed to live up to the consistent oohing and aahing that surrounds its ever-growing reputation.It was our first day in San Francisco, and by the time we drove into town we were famished, in desparate need of sustenance. I had already fired up my Yelp app and had pinpointed some promising locations in the Castro area. While we were scoping the area out on foot, my eye managed to hone in on Ike's. I was so surprised and happy to run across this iconic sandwich shop that I had heard so many good things about. It only took a matter of seconds for us to decide that we had finally found our lunch destination.The interior isn't what I expected. There's no available seating to speak of. No tables. No catchy or showy design aesthetic. No, none of those silly things can be found at Ike's. All you'll find is a drab counter where you place your order in front of a large, expansive menu that has every type of sandwich combination that you can think of. I tortured myself over the menu; I wanted it all. I finally settled on the Matt Cain, a creation that consisted of roast beef, salami, godfather sauce and provolone. My B.K. chose the Hot Momma Huda (halal chicken, Franks Red Hot Sauce, ranch and provolone). In other words, he basically ordered a hot wing sandwich. My Matt Cain was ridiculously delicious. The accompanying sauce, the godfather sauce, manages to perfectly marry every ingredient to produce a sammie that is on a playing field that no chain could ever hope to aspire towards. Absolutely, I ate Matt Cain with unbridled enthusiasm. And he's a big boy, too! I was a happy boy. And if things couldn't get any better, they did! I managed to steal a couple of bites from the Hot Momma Huda that my B.K. was chomping on -- it was sheer ecstasy on a sandwich roll. Each sandwich comes with your choice of potato chips. I believe the drinks were separate. All in all, fantastic experience, one that I certainly look forward to replicating again on my next adventure to the Bay area.
Amazing Sandwiches!!! I came to Ike's in SF 2 yrs ago and was hooked.. Sadly there was none in LA where i live till now! So much fucking win! Nomnomnomnomnom
This place was busy, but the counter service was quick and experienced. We ordered a vegan chicken bbq sandwich and the favorite menage trois. After a bit of a wait, we received our sandwiches and lollipops and couldn't have been more thrilled! Both were incredible and we were tempted to go back in and order more to-go. We will definitely be back!
This is hands-down the best sandwich I have ever had. There is a reason for all these five star reviews! I went to Ike's Place for the first time last week after my brother, who has lived in SF for about 4 years, suggested it for lunch. After careful consideration of their extensive online menu, I decided on the Wario, which is veggie meatballs, marinara, and fried mozzarella sticks (fyi: the meat version of the same is called Super Mario). I have been a vegetarian for 12 years and I'm used to 1-2 vegetarian options, if that, at sandwich shops. It was so refreshing to have a ton to choose from, and then the sandwich itself was amazing! The Dutch Crunch bread was perfection, the condiments were delicious, and I mean...mozzarella sticks on a sandwich? Best idea ever. I can't wait to go back and try more options. Tip: Definitely check the menu online before you go. They don't list all of the sandwiches on their board. Also, there are also a few secret sandwiches so look those up, too.
Best sandwich place I've been to in San Francisco. The menag trois is my favorite sandwich, it's also their best sandwich here. Call ahead if you don't want to wait in line on weekends or during lunch hours. Also, chips are free with a sandwich.
When you read the descriptions for the sandwiches you think "okay, that sounds pretty good." But then when you actually try one it's like "whoa! I was not expecting it to be THAT good!!!"So far I have tried: Matt Cain, mnage trois, Mario bros, and going home for thanksgiving.  All on Dutch crunch. My fav is the going home for thanksgiving and a close second is the Matt Cain!
Extra Star today I think I found my go to sammy.."Say Hey" = so yummy! Pastrami, BACON, pickles, tomato, lettuce, onion and extra dirty sauce. The bacon was crispy perfect with the dutch crunch bread and pastrami. The bbq ranch Zapps was just ok. I wish I got my go to the Dill flavor.
The best sandwiches ever.
thank you Ike's for your vegan options!! each one I've had (Captain Kirk, Handsome Owl, and Pilgrim) are amazing, but Pilgrim has to be my favorite. Usually, a vegan sando somewhere else consists of veggies with weak condiments, and no cheese or meat alternative. Ike's really has super tasty vegan options, that are not boring, and each have a unique personality.
I got a [your favorite Sesame Street character] on Dutch Crunch, add jalapeo poppers...what ensued was the only time in my adult life that I have cried over food.So...my parents, sister, dog and I waited in line and got our sandwiches. The wait went by way faster than expected and the place was fun to be in...super nice staff, cool weird sandwich posters, a bathroom! It was great.We walked to Dolores park and ate our food while eavesdropping on a vagrant teenager's weed brownie transaction descending quickly into an impassioned plea for his customers to trek out to Burning Man, lest they never transform and manifest their intentions in our capitalistic, money-driven rat race which we call modern life.A guy playing Frisbee was checking me out, trying to catch my eye but I could not have cared less. The only thing in my eye was pesto. I had cream cheese all over my face...this was the best fucking sandwich I had ever had in my life. The bread alone blew anything I've ever had out of the water to be consumed by uninspired flies on the bleak and desolate shore of mediocrity.I restrained myself and saved the second half of the sandwich, knowing that its explosive and all-consuming pleasure would only multiply later in the evening, when I vanquished, trapped in the hotel room under the starvation of my shamelessly anorexic family.Seven hours later, ravenous as predicted due to my family's (also predicted) disinterest in eating again that day, I searched for my sandwich. I found it. In the ice bucket. Completely soaked in ice-cold, dirty water.I began to act irrationally. I banged my head against the wall languidly...letting out a soft "fuck." Beyond this, I could not speak. My savage family, whose hearts and senses of food-storage logic no doubt atrophy daily under their abstention from any more than one daily meal, looked on in confusion and disbelief that I was indeed, crying. My tears could not have been contained by the Hoover Dam, or any amount of "adult" restraint and care for the feelings of others. I attempted to dissemble my devastation under the thin veil of a half-hearted abortion of a laugh. It was useless.I, quite literally, cried over a sandwich, for an immodestly protracted period of time. You should probably go get one and see which of the deeply-concealed, shamefully childish bowels of your subconscious are illuminated.
Best sandwich place in SF! Plus they have a really well thought out vegetarian menu.. some of the other sandwich places I have been to have really crappy afterthought options for vegetarians, but not Ikes.Have had their Meatless Mike in their Stanford outlet and Ugly Owl in SF and both are really really awesome! And they come with a big bag of chips, and weirdly a lollipop!Glad this place is not in SOMA.. trying to go on a diet will become soo much harder if this place ever ventures north.This place prolli has a big line at most hours of the day.. but come here on a Saturday morning a little after 10 and you will find no line at all. They still make you wait quite a while while they make your sandwich though.
Yum yum yum!! I got the spiffy tiffy and it was amazing .. the bread the sauce the meat .. Yum! There are so many options for sandwiches that I wish I could've tried them all ..but there sandwiches are rather big portion so only had room for one .. especially since this was only meant to be a snack .. Teheh :) I got my sandwich with red onions and jalapenos .. and they weren't too spicyThere wasn't a line when I came around two pm on a Wednesday .. but they had two separate lines .. one was just walk in the other as for phone in orders and VIP members lol I guess the lines get pretty crazy ..The staff was super nice .. the guy came out to have me my sandwich but before I could grab it from him he was like sorry I think we messed up and went back to the kitchen to fix whatever happened .. he apologized few times though it really was no big deal since I was not a bit hungry -.- Seating is a bit difficult since they only have a bench and few chairs .. and these sandwiches really need to be eaten sitting down .. I'm really craving their sandwich right now but sadly I'm on my way back to L.A. :(
Best sandwiches in the city. EXTRAdirty is the way to go! Fried rings, zucchini, mozzarella sticks, jalapeos? Yeah, THATS the way to go. Grab it to go and enjoy the city views with a big 'oil good sammich!
Seeing as my corner Pal's Takeaway is on break while moving to their new location, it was time to find a new sandwich nirvana. Time to pop my Castro cherry and Ike's cherry all in one go.The gods must have been with us that day because there was only one other person in line. The ordering process was painless and within a few minutes, our sandwich was ready. The sandwiches at Ike's are big enough for sharing, so we split a Menage A Trois (BBQ, cheddar, halal chicken, honey mustard, pepper jack, real honey, swiss) on dutch crunch.I have to say that dutch crunch must be the perfect bread for a sandwich. It's soft enough to absorb some of the juices, crunchy enough to give you that texture, and it isn't a struggle to bite off. Optimum sandwich enjoyment. The Menage A Trois was great. I was full, but those flavors just kept me going until I was licking sauce off my fingers. I want to taste a couple of their other sandwiches before I give it a fifth star though. But first, I have to actually get through reading the incredibly long menu.Ike's doesn't have a lot of seats and nary a table in sight, so you'll have to figure that one out for yourself. Either wolf down your sammich, perform a balancing act, get thee to Dolores Park, or park your butt in some other restaurant with outdoor seating and order some dessert (that's what we did).You will definitely do, Ike's.
I've had Ike's several times at different locations. The first two times didn't live up to the hype and I was a little disappointed. I decided to give it another shot though and went with "Name of Girl I'm Dating". I guess the third time really is the charm because it was delicious. And I may or may not have been dreaming about it since then...I love the variety in the menu and the fact that the sandwiches are fairly customizable in terms of ingredients, which are all fresh. It is a little bit pricy but worth it once in a while.
Step aside Subway+Quiznos, you guys have NOTHING on IKE. Ike's signature formula for line-worth sandwiches =Generous HEAPING portions of Mouth-Watering Meats + Fresh Veggies/stuffing + crazy names + Signature Dirty Sauce = 5 Star WINNER!!!!!!!!Man vs. Food did a segment on Ike's Place and my bff Shannon has been raving about this joint for quite some time now. They are famous for their signature Dirty Sauce--a mysterious paste concoction of garlic and spices. On a recent trip up to the Bay Area (I'm from SoCal) I just HAD to try this. Most delicious sandwiches I've had in a long time. Ike's sandwiches sure lives up to the TV/Yelp/word-of-mouth hype. There are layers upon layers of mouth-watering meats and fresh veggies+stuffing. Every sandwich is made to order--which is probably why there is a ridiculous line out the door. Quick Tip: Say good-bye to the 2 hour wait! Save time and hours of your life--order by phone (415) 553-6888, for pick-up and convenience. Yummies in the Tummies:- Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian, $8, (5/5): The grilled mushrooms, marinated artichokes, pesto, provolone and DIRTY SAUCE was perfect in taste and looks! I devoured this melted goodness and was so satisfied. ^_^- Do You Smell What Barack is Cooking? $10, (5/5): Layers of thinly sliced rib eye steak, BBQ sauce, smoke gouda and DIRTY SAUCE was both hearty and full of flavor! - Kryptonite, $20, (friend gave it 5/5): THE grand daddy of sandwiches. 13 ingredients and a whopping 4 POUNDS!!! (Gotta unhinge your jaw for this and maybe have the medic on hold.) My bff and her bf shared just half of this collossel sandwich and was ridiculously HUMONGOUS!! There's like a whole army of MEAT- roast & corned beef, pastrami, salami, turkey bacon, ham and STUFFING--stuffed jalapeno poppers, beer battered onion rings, avocado, pesta and of course, DIRTY SAUCE!!!! A pretty messy, but delicious looking sandwich. (I may take up that challenge next time I go back)- Dirty Potato Chips Funky Fusion flavor (5/5): If Sea Salt & Vinegar and BBQ flavor chips got together and had a baby, it's the Funky Fusion potato chip. Pretty darn delicious. My friends and I think Dirty Potato Chips may have specially created this flavor for Ikes because we can't find this flavor at any store or grocery market! Only found here! Finger looking goodness all around ! Ike's Place lived up to the hype !
I haven't had the opportunity to actually visit this place. So this 5 star review is strictly for their sandwiches :)If you are vegetarian, look no further - Get the Stupid Eggplant sandwich. You will not be disappointed. You will go straight to sandwich heaven and lurk there for the longest!!PS: If you are vegan and have other forms of dietary restrictions, look no further, Ike's caters to your needs :)PPS: My mouth is watering thinking about the Stupid Eggplant sammich right now. I will be getting me one this weekend!
Got the 'We're just friends' with red onions, super good! Really filling, so if you are starving it is totally the right size. Would be coming here again and try all their sandwiches!
YUMMY sandwich! Such a long wait in line but it was totally worth it. Definitely will come back.
AUGH. so good. if it wasn't for the gd 2 hr wait, i think i would drive the 6 hours to eat here every other weekend. ordered the manage-a-trois, the will the thrill, and the name of the girl im dating (thx janey for the recommendation on this one!) i gotta say...its the bread and sauce that made me fall in love. the dutch crunch & the dirty sauce=money.a MUST. im DEF dropping by the next time im up north.
I'm giving 4 stars for the awesome sandwichesand 1 star for the Caramel apple pop they give you along with it. Matt Cain on dutch Crunch with extra dirty always.
Not much needs to be added. The hype is real. The line moves quick. Come try it once and judge it for yourself.My eyes have now been opened to the world of Dutch Crunch. Where have you been all my life?
Decided to stop by this restaurant after reading an article on the "6 best sandwiches in SF" on the thrillist.com website. I was not disappointed at all! I had the Menage a trois which was so so so so so so so so so so soooooooooooo good.The chicken was tender and the sauce was perfect. I ended up sharing a sandwich with my girlfriend which was the only disappointment - I DIDN'T GET ENOUGH! This will definitely be a MUST VISIT every time I return to the city to demolish the rest of the menu!
While I like this place, it's just too expensive. The samy's are delicious and plenty. Been many times. The menu is huge so if you're hungry, you'll do what I did.A guy had just received his drippy large package of delish. I was so hungry I just said, I'll have what he's having. Ouch on the bill.
What more can I say? The reviews say it all, so badass, so delicious, so yummy.The best part? you even get a lil lolipop at the end!haha even the man v. food guy came to check it out!TiP: NEXT TIME - ONLINE ORDERING OR CALL IN. DON'T BE WAITIN IN THAT LONG ASS LINE! But even if you don't - wait. it'll be worth it. the best damn sandwich i've ever had in my life!! haha, but don't come if you're into the regular sandwiches. don't expect no turkey and cheese slapped on bread. sorry, only come if you're ready to experience THE BEST SANDWICH EVER!! also, staff is great! and you best get yourself some of those chips!PS. hope you have a bottle opener key chain because some of the super cool old school sodas aren't twist off :)
I know this place is famous and all, but when my friends suggested we eat here my first though was 'ugh, sandwiches...'I'm just not a big fan of sandwiches. It's just meat, cheese and sauce on bread. I can make that at home. I don't like paying people to make something so simple. But I kept my mouth shut and tried it anyways. I got the 'Change' which was ribeye, BBQ sauce, cheddar, and beer battered onion rings on dutch crunch bread. I can't even describe it, but it was amazingly good! It was even a little soggy but it didn't even affect the taste. The choices are a little overwhelming and I don't really like the cutesy names they give them. But this is definitely a must try if you are in the area!Minus one star for no seating.
I made it my goal to stop by while I was in SF, because of the great reviews and stories about this place! Honestly, I was very disappointed.1. I expected a long line and I was perfectly fine with it, but the cashiers moved fairly slowly. They were not the friendliest and could have been more attentive.2. I went in with a group, and we had 5 different orders. 4/5 orders came out fairly quickly, but 1 order was forgotten. We had to ask for it, an employee went to check, and the employee came back to take the order again. They lost the order, and it took forever to come out. We asked another employee, and he gave us attitude. Finally, the sandwich came out and it took about 20-30 minutes to make since he took the order.However, the food was still delicious. the rest of our group's sandwiches were soggy, but still pretty good tasting!I would come back, but only if I was in the area. It took me 30+ minutes to find parking. The customer service makes me hesitant to do that again.
Legendary sandwiches. Gotta have that Super Mario sandwich. The best around!
Ike's is a must try when in SF! The sandwiches are bursting with crazy flavor and the menu has some of the silliest names every bestowed on sandwiches. They're pricey, but huge - I can be satisfied with half. And each comes with chips and a caramel apple lollipop! The lollipop is my favorite part of the meal, sadly.Favorites:1) Jaymee Sirewich: chicken fried chicken, Ike's yellow bbq, pepper jack, ranchI could eat this all day and night and then repeat again the next day and night2) Spiffy Tiffy: avocado, halal chicken, mushrooms, pepper jack, pesto, provoloneI like pepper jack. A lot.3) [Name of Girl I'm Dating]: avocado, halal chicken, honey mustard, pepper jackApparently everyone loves this one, and it's definitely good, but I think a little overhyped.Beware:1) Parking sucks.2) The wait can get pretty long: the line can get pretty epic, and you'll still have to wait to get your sandwich too.3) These babies get messy and drippy; arm yourself with napkins!4) There is very little seating inside, and definitely no tables for eating - take your food to the park instead (DONT FORGET NAPKINS!).Also, Bi-Rite Ice Cream is pretty close to Ike's and makes for the perfect dessert!
Some amazing sandwiches I've had from Ike's:*The M.I.L.F--the Hot Mama Huda with Jalapeno poppers (I like the fried chicken better than halal)*Meatless Mike--I'm not a vegetarian/vegan, but I love this sandwich.*Matt CainI can't remember the other sandwiches I've had here, but I have never had a problem with the food quality. They have unique bottled beverages to choose from (Leninade anyone?) and they give you a free Caramel Apple Lollipop with your sandwich!Why it gets a FOUR-STAR...the lines. It's such a good place, people are willing to stay in line. If you're impatient, don't come to this place. Their queueing system ticks me off at times, but I'm reminded of why I wait in line after I take my first bite.As far as SF sandwich prices go, it's a little high for some of the sandwiches. Like I said, it's a treat coming out here.
OH YES. FInallllly!!! It's about time I reviewed something that hasn't pissed me off :) Love this place! Other than the fact I was completely hungover when coming here, their sandwiches are really delicious!!! Probably one of the best sandwiches I've ever had EVER! The line here was super long and we had to wait probably around 30 mins, but it's totally worth it. I ordered the first thing on the menu...(Forgot what it was called) but it was soo good: juicy, fresh, and everything you can imagine from a really yummy sandwich. it had chicken and a bunch of other stuff on it. I couldn't finish it, but it tasted even better when i went home and heated it up in the oven and put tabasco on it! Only thing is the chips are toooo salty, but all the workers here are super nice and i really love this place! can't wait to go back, preferably not hungover.
To be honest, before I tried a sandwich at one of Ike's joints, I loathed the idea of paying for a sandwich. His South Bay joints were good but man, the SF one just sells it all!I got the Zevity and man, this sandwich was huge! It was DELICIOUS and it sure filled me up. I couldn't even finish the chips that came with it! The pesto was delicious and just worked together with everything else to create a beautiful sandwich. I can't wait to try more sandwiches at Ike's!!! Beware of crowds if you come in at peak hours!
Extremely good sandwiches.I'd highly recommend the MILF which is the Hot Momma Huda with jalapeno poppers instead of provolone cheese).They have a good variety but some of them are pretty basic (menage a trois and spiffy tiffy are a bit overrated).
This is my first stop every time I'm in San Francisco and my last stop before I leave. Their sandwiches are RICH with flavor, which both surprised and and impressed me the most. Their dutch crunch bread goes out pretty fast so if you get a chance to order it, don't pass it up. Pretty much every sandwich I've had was delicious. Gold. There's always a nice surprise like matching sweet flavors of cranberry jam with sriracha on their Thanksgiving sandwich or just a magical sauce makes the sandwich heavenly.Try something new whenever you go, their menu never disappoints!
Me n' the fam (5 generations in SF!) have been long time fans of Ike's. The only complaint (not really) I can think of: I've always thought the Mac Dre sammie should have some kind of Thizzle Drizzle...and speaking of reppin' tha Bay, where's the Andre Nickatuna sandwich?
I've been here a couple times, and most recently brought a friend who was skeptical about waiting in a long line for a sandwich. However, he was quickly reassured that it would be worth it after reading the menu. Important to note here that the line may seem intimidating but goes by surprisingly fast.As for the sandwiches, they have a great selection on the board above the registers, but there are many more items on their online menu. Both of our sandwiches were evenly hot through the whole thing, cheese just hitting that perfect melting point and the meet still steaming. This last time I ordered "Change" (BBQ, Beer Battered Onion Rings, Gouda, thinly sliced rib eye) which was around $12. He had the Kryptonite which is... pretty much everything on the menu (Avocado, Bacon, Beer Battered Onion Rings, EXTRA Pepper Jack, Ham, Mozzarella Sticks, Pastrami, Pesto, Roast Beef, Salami, Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers, Turkey). This mother f---er was about $27 but it was huge. Not just thick huge, but they gave two sandwich sized halves, each of those being cut in half. He's a big eater but one half of a sandwich (a quarter of the whole thing) was more than enough. The rest made for great leftovers.Prices range from about $8-$30 depending on what sandwich you pick, but each one is a craft of its own made complete with their special sauce. Its an experience in itself, worth the wait and price - and that's coming from a person who usually tries to avoid sandwich joints.
Okay Ike's. So you live up to your reputation.Quality sandwich joint. That's one dense sandwich. I love the hipster soda and chip selection. After that first bite I was addicted. It's crazy how you can make a sandwich so good. It's just a sandwich. But dang.And whoever named those sandwiches is freaking awesome. Bravo Ikes. Bravo.
D-FcKn-LICIOUS!Ike's catchy clever hilarious names for his sammies made me a fan even before first bite. I'm the kind of eater that likes to be prepared so with over 50 amazing sounding sammies to choose from I had some major research to take on. Dutch Crunch Bread = check! That was a no brainerBacon added to whatever sammie = done! I mean, come on I'm Ciara and Bacon is my middle name. On to the sammie itself, Oh man, really? Seriously? How do you choose?Well, you just do. In my case you copy your fave choices off their website and paste them into a text box on your iphone and then text yourself the choices. Seriously this is what I did and how I decided. I stared at my choices for over a day and when I finally made it to Ike's to place my order Napoleon Complex it was. Super great choice I was told by the dude taking my order. Turkey, Honey Poppy Seed French Dressing, Avocado, Havarti Cheese and I added bacon. OF course I added extra Dirty Sauce and topped my sammie with all the fixins (hold the pickle). HUGE, Warm, and TASTY!!!!!! The flavors were mind blowing. The Dutch Crunch bread was out of this world and the Dirty Sauce.....Oh that Dirty Sauce.No place to eat your sammie here as it is strictly take out. So strict as their crappy neighbors actually have a lawsuit against them so they are selling SAVE IKE'S Tee Shirts ($20 buy one and get one free) to help cover the cost for their lawyer fees. Of course I bought one! Stupid neighbors. If I lived near Ike's I would be super stoked. And super fat. Hmm...maybe that's what this whole lawsuit is about.Sammies are MADE TO ORDER and are served warm so prepare to wait a bit. There is no place to enjoy your sammie on the spot, so I suggest heading over to Dolores Park. Don't take too long deciding on where to enjoy your sammie at as you have to eat it while it is still warm and even with the Dutch Crunch the bread tends to get soggy as it is loaded with delicious saucy sauces. CASH ONLY so bring a Jackson as a sammie and bottled bevi will run you about $12-$15 One sammie down now only 49 Ike's deliciousness more to try. I will be returning for sure on every SF visit.
Long line goes by very fast! It's the wait for the food that takes 10 minutes, but trust Ike's sandwiches are worth all the hype it's received.For those tempted to sit and wait or eat on Ike's neighbor's steps, there is a security guard that will ensure your butt doesn't get the chance to touch the ground. Don't even try, he looks buff. The sandwich is MASSIVE, feel free to split with a friend. We got Spiffy Tiffy on Dutch Crunch (it's a very healthy sandwich that tastes the part) and Hot Momma Huda on sourdough (tasted like hot wings in a bun, fingerlickin good). Order comes with chips and a caramel apple lollipop. For the chips, I suggest sticking with sea salt, unless you love abnormally hot jalapeno, and overly salty sea salt and pepper. We took their suggestion and took our meal to Dolores Park (a short 5 minute walk away, front row view of dogs who like to show off and yoga masters) and finished our meal with a nice nap at the park dreaming of the next Ike's sandwich to try.
When: June 4, 2011Location: Castro in SFCompany: My boyfriend, ChrisCrowd: All types of people!Vibe: Crowded. Confused people who didn't know where the menu was, like us! It's basically 5 sheets of paper that is stapled on the top left hand corner. Looks like some kind of studying material.Decor: The guy from Man VS Food had his picture with a note hung on the wall.. Awards for the sandwich shop and tons of bags of chips! Cuisine: Sandwiches! YUM!Service: Great!Hate: They give you a free bag of chips, however it's the kind that's cooked in peanut oil! What about the people who are allergic to peanuts? Also, They ran out of tomatoes that day.Total: $25.00 for 2Side note: The sandwiches were awesome! I had:Pizzle: which had Halal Chicken Breast, Bacon, Ranch, Cheddar.. It was super good.. However, it can get messy. I would request easy on the Ranch or none at all.. My boyfriend, Chris had:The Hollywood SF Cheesesteak: which had Thinly Sliced Rib Eye Steak, Mushrooms, Provolone..This place makes me want to print out the menu and try every single sandwich here.. =)
Craving a big, juicy, high calorie, messy sandwich? You've come to the right place, my friends. Honestly, Ike's extensive menu makes it highly stressful for a sometimes indecisive individual such as myself, but whatever sandwich eeny, meeny, miny, moe lands me on, it's sure to be delicious. My favorite is the Manage A Trois.
On me and my boyfriend's San Francisco adventure he wouldn't let us leave until we made a visit to Ike's Place...why??? Because he saw this massive sandwich called "Kryptonite" on Man vs. Food. So he ordered the sandwich and he said it was so massive that we could both share it...I though for almost $20 we better be able to share it for lunch and dinner! But I was patient and obliged because he was sooooo excited. The folks that work here are very helpful because the menu is pretty overwhelming so they offered to cut up our sandwich into 4 pieces so that we could get through it. Once we got the sandwich I even got a little excited...it was all kinds of meat: pastrami, salami, turkey, ham, bacon with pesto onion rings, mozzarella sticks and some other items in between 2 slices of bread. I immediately thought this can't be a good look for my life...but after 1 bite I was in heaven. All of the flavors together were delish and actually worked pretty good together. you could def. tell that they use very high quality meat and bread. Unfortunately I was only able to make it through 1 half of the sandwich...but at least I tried!!
Definitely a good sandwich! I love the naming convention. Great selection of sodas.Highly recommended.
OMG...best...sandwiches...ever.Been here about 2 times, the service is always good. If you are here on a weekend or at lunch time....expect the line to be out the door. Lucky for me, I like to eat at odd hours.I had the "Hollywood's SF Cheesesteak", it was the best cheesesteak sandwich I ever had. Especially with their dutch crust bread. It was AMAZING! I think I will make it a habit to come here every time I am in SF.
The sandwiches here are the bomb! I am someone who deigns eating with her hands and thinks eating certain food items in layers is best way to go because hello, no mess, but I wrapped my chubby fingers around one of these sandwiches and stuffed my face like a pro. (End thats-what-she-said moment). Much dripping of sauces and condiments ensued, but I didn't even care. Sharing is recommended, as these are too big to handle by yourself. (Ok, NOW end twss moment).
Amazing Sandos
UPDATE: SHUT THE FRONT DOOR!!!!!! SHUT. THE. FRONT. DOOR. And re-open the door right across the street from the original location! More spacious (not much more, but apt for sitting or at least standing indoors while waiting), and less waiting time (for now), Ike's has redeemed itself and redemption has never tasted SO GOOD. As I wrote in my last review, I was sorely disappointed with my sandwich at the Lime location. It just wasn't the same. But thank the heavens for blessing us with Ike's return to 16th St.! Was craving BBQ/cheddar, so I tried the Everett Middle School and substituted chicken with veggie bacon. And it. was. BOMB! The bbq sauce complemented the dirty sauce so well, and all the ingredients happily swam in my mouth! Not a single complaint. I had planned to "save half of my sandwich" for tomorrow's lunch. PSSH obviously that didn't happen. There must be crack in that sauce b/c it was ADDICTING and I DEVOURED that sandwich like it was the last supper. Ladies and gents, the best sandwich is BACK in the HOUSE! =D
I. Love. This. Place.
I've been here twice and both times my sandwich was soggy-licious by the time I got to Dolores Park...I will try again soon!
The line is worth the wait. First time at Ike's and I'm sold! Food: Decided (after much pondering, to say the least, due to their extensive menu) on the Going Home for Thanksgiving. Turkey, cranberry sauce, sriracha, lettuce, pepperjack cheese (instead of the havarti that's listed on the menu), and light on the Dirty Secret Sauce. Ordered it on Ike's Famous Dutch Crunch bread. Soooo full of flavor. I was in sandwich heaven as I slowly ate this masterpiece. Oh, and to make matters even better, each sandwich comes with your choice of one of 8+ varieties of chips and a caramel apple lollipop.Savory + salty + sweet. All in one meal.Vegan and vegetarian friendly with lots of sandwich combinations for those with dietary restrictions.Price: $-$$. Not a cheap sandwich like Subway or Quizno's but rather a moderately priced one with MUCH fresher ingredients than those chains. Also, as I mentioned earlier, each sandwich comes with your choice of 1 of 8+ choices of chips AND a caramel apple lollipop (childhood memories...). These inclusions as well as the large sandwich with no shortage of meat and toppings justifies the price.
The only problem with these sandwiches are they are so darn good and huge.I love ordering Tuna with Avocado, you have to ask for it...its not on the menu. With that great sauce of theirs, mixed with the avocado and Tuna. I can only do this a few times a year, but when I do, so happy.
Came in on a whim and ordered a Nacho Boy on Dutch Crunch.Sandwich was good. They toasted the bun and meat + cheese.Sandwich sauce was too drippy and created a mess. Good thing for napkins!Sandwich came with a small bag of chips. Nice.Appreciated the lollipop but did not really need it.The sandwich shop seemed a little bit dark and the restroom needed work but I liked my sandwich. I would probably go back and check out their Menage x3, just for the hype.
This review is a long time in the making, I campaign so vigorously for Ike's on a daily basis, you would think I got paid for it. Then I realized I had never gotten around to Yelping them, and I came with haste to right that wrong. Ike's is by far and away both a "top-10 Places to Eat in SF"for me, and a general "Must-see/try in SF" for me as well, that I tirelessly champion wherever I go. Even if you only try their legendary sandwhiches once, once is all it takes for this other-worldly experience. I would like to recommend a few things specifically, but on second thought, part of the mystique of Ike's is that it's all so, well, both unique, and delicious!! I feel if I recommend a specific sandwhich it would do the others a disservice because unlike your average restaurant/diner/sandwhich shop, there is no one "must try", they are all "must trys", and you must negotiate your "first time" with Ikes as such.A San Francisco landmark, 'nuff said.
Love this! Was lucky enough to hit Ike's on a slow day. The sandwiches were delicious but I'm not sure if they're worth the hype. Recommend it for those with a big appetite who want some flair and aren't too aware of what subs on the east coast taste like!
I jumped at the opportunity of finally getting to eat here when I came up to Norcal to visit my boyfriend during winter break. I sat on the BART for an hour and walked for ~20 minutes to get here. When I saw the sign, it took a while to register that I was finally, FINALLY here. My boyfriend and I got here at about 11:30 or 11:45am and there was hardly any wait, which was very lucky, because soon after, the line become very long, very quickly.Inside, the decor was somewhat strange. There was ample seating, although they roped off the back. There were small tables and chairs along one side and cushions at the front of the restaurant. They also had a bar that was glowing in pink light? I don't know. That's not important. What's important is that my boyfriend ordered the Ex-girlfriend on Dutch Crunch (one of the types of bread that you can choose - I highly recommend it!) and I ordered the Menage a Trois on Dutch Crunch. The sandwiches were quite big. Although the price was a bit steep ($11.11 for their famous Menage a Trois), the taste of the sandwiches with their secret Dirty Sauce was worth it. I wouldn't come here to eat on a regular basis because of the price, but as a once in a while treat (or in my case, a long while), I'd definitely make that trip.Among all the humorously-named sandwiches they offer (and they offer a LOT - it fills up three sheets of paper), they also have a lot of vegan and vegetarian options, which I think is really great.Service was quick and incredibly friendly. Overall, my experience here at Ike's was ace. Thanks, Ike's!
Now this is where u buy a Sando in the City.I have to be in the civic center twice a week. At least once i end up at Ike's.. Lovingth e Menage a Trois.. oh i am serious about the name AND how damn good,.Oh please, please, please, do not forget to check out "name of a girl im dating".. Or damn " Nacho Boy"...But get ANYTHING (whether u usually would or not ) on DUTC CRUNCH.. Trust Me... SIGH... Again i say....: OH MY GOD
This is one of the few places that really lives up to the hype. 100% worth the wait. Huge variety on the menu, fair prices, and the best sandwich you will ever have.
Sandwiches bigger than your head? CheckMessy food? CheckGood bread? Check (but too much of it)Never seen Ike, though.
Gluten free, vegan sandwich bread +Vegan dirty sauce+Vegan cheese =Heaven for someone with food allergies. I don't even need to say anything else. The sandwiches are amazing, the staff is great. Order ahead so you don't wait for-ev-er in line. And do yourself the favor and go there, regularly.
I had the Paul's Reuben sandwich on Dutch Crunch. Definitely one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. All the ingredients were Very Very tasty and delicious, that special dirty sauce is succulent! The dutch crunch was thin, not sure if they pressed it or hollowed the inside but I like it. It is pricey for a sandwich so only a once in a while treat. The BBQ potato chips were kettle cooked and awesome, yummy! Not sure what brand they were?Only negative was the service/cashier... had an attitude but it's understandable dealing with so many people (place was packed). But it's a negative since it was a first impression for me.
Yummy Sandwiches, but a long wait!
Yes, it's worth the hour wait! Tip - try ordering after the lunch rush - we called in an order at 4pm on a Saturday and were caught off guard when they said our sandwiches would be ready in 20 minutes. Gluten free menu - gluten free sandwich rolls - amazing. It's a pastrami charmed life indeed. Thank you, Ike!
AWESOME! Had the Menage A Trois on Dutch Crunch bread with voodoo chips!super delicious sandwich, plus the chips were AMAZING! like they were a mix of barbecue and i don't know what else, they were just salty sweet savoury and a perfect complement to the sandwichThe people who work there are wonderful, the girl at the counter helped us order and was super nice, she's the one who suggested we try the voodoo chips!will definitely come again when in San Fran :)*plus they have halal meat and vegan options, which is awesome*
This was one of the best sandwiches hands down, but I like Lou's better. I got the Matt Cain and it was too messy. The sauces were dripping out and it was getting all over my hands. Although it was messy, it was good too. It filled me up and was very tasty and savory. I would rate this a 4.5 stars but I don't think it's worth 5 stars.
I ordered the breezy b and it was the best sandwich ever!! The bread was crunchy yet soft. They didn't skimp on inside do every bite was the most of the sandwich. The wait is pretty long but I say it's well worth the wait. I would probably skip on any Ike's drink products, the gal who works there said that she hadn't heard good things about them so... I would listen to her. Should check out this if you are ever in town
I'm a bit of a cynic. I was convinced that there was no way for Ike's Place to live up to the hype.I mean, the hype surrounding Ike's Place is epic. Between the thousands (!) of 5-star Yelp reviews and Guy Fieri's enthusiastic endorsement, I had to see for myself what the fuss was about.And you know what? For Ike's, the hype is 100% deserved. These sandwiches are among the most delicious I've ever had.Here's how it went down:We showed up at Ike's at 2pm on a Saturday afternoon, and there was a line stretching halfway down the block. We were anticipating this, so we patiently took our place at the end and waited for a half-hour, passing the time by reading the long menu and poking gentle fun at the hipsters walking by.When we finally reached the door and I placed my order, I opted for the Elvis Keith -- with everything on it. That meant teriyaki chicken, wasabi mayo, swiss cheese, avocado, and a towering stack of veggies, all on a delicious Dutch Crunch roll. It came with a bag of chips thrown in. Even with tax, it was well under $10. Once the food was in our hands, we walked over to Dolores Park for a little Ike's Place picnic. In short: the sandwich was HUGE and absolutely AMAZING.  The roll was so sweet and crunchy and packed with flavor. The chicken was juicy and perfect. But my favorite part was definitely the wasabi mayo. It had just the right amount of spice. Yum.This monster was so huge that I ate half at the park and saved the other half for dinner. And you know what? It was still delicious 6 hours later, even after sitting in the fridge all afternoon.Just eat here. It's so perfect.San Francisco doesn't get much better than this.
With 5000 reviews, what's the point of writing? I seem to be in the minority; everyone likes Ike's. But after having tried both their meat and veggie options on at least six different occasions ... I realized, THEY ALL TASTE THE SAME. And I have yet to enjoy my sandwich. At this point, I'm going to stop trying. The special sauce? It's mostly mayo, which I am a big fan of normally, but on Ike's sandwiches there's so damn much of it that it drowns out all the other flavors. Also, lots of meat but no veggies makes for a weird ratio on a sandwich. Service is always excellent, however. And I like that they have halal meat. Two starts for that.
I've always been skeptical when people rave about a sandwich place - I mean, it's a sandwich; how good could it possibly be? Ike's legitimately is good though, like, it lives up to all the hype. There's just something really impressive about how all the whacky combos here work. They just work so well. There is no other word to describe the sandwiches here besides delicious. At the core of it, what makes this place good is the simple fact that their sandwiches always taste really, really good. The Count of Monte Chase-o is SO good and is hands down my favorite thing here!
One of my new favs. Gluten free, vegan sandwich!?!? That is delicious? Thanks for being amazing! My husband got "Mike Hunts daughter" and enjoy every minute of eating it. The line is worth it :)
I was initially skeptical because I thought to myself, how could it be that good it's just a sandwich place? BUT after trying Ike's not once but twice over my weekend trip to SF, I support the hype whole-heartedly. I think what makes the sandwiches special is the distinct sauciness (You'll know what I'm talking about when you try--careful of dripping sauce!) And the dutch crunch bread! It makes an ordinary sandwich into an extraordinary one. Order different sandwiches and split with your friends, that way you can try many types! Each average around $10 bucks. What we got:Spiffy TiffyComing home for Thanksgiving Mnage a Trois Matt Cain [btw the pastrami is made of Turkey so those who don't eat pork do not have to miss out!] My favorite was Mnage a Trois! Bi-Rite is closeby for dessert! Take both and eat at Dolores Park :)
My favorite! The only problem is choosing a sandwich because they are all good!
LOVE this place! Their sandwiches are one of a kind and most of the time, bigger than your head. I used to frequent this place when they had their own little shop but I think they got shut down because the lines were too long and it was disturbing their neighbors? LAME. I would've enjoyed living next to a place that makes such amazing sandwiches. :) Then they moved to share a space with Lime but now I'm unsure as to where they're at.. None the less, if you're looking for a great sandwich (probably to share with others), this is the place to go! Great for a picnic at the park or even walking through SF. :)
The wait is quite long--I'd say about 30 minutes, but Ikes is definitely worth the wait!!! My friend and I ordered a Matt Cain and Menage a Trois, and both sandwiches were delicious!!!!!!! It was great that our sandwiches each came with a bag of chips and candy! The price is average, but the sandwich is worth the price tag! Ikes totally lives up to the hype, and I will be coming back for more!
AWESOME SANDWICHES! the best of the best! I can eat them all day! And I'm from SoCal, so I'd have to fly up there to get me. Possibly worth the flight... DELICIOUS!!!
Wow. I loved Ike's Place. I had the [Girl Who I'm Dating] on Dutch Crunch. Delicious. We waited 15-20 minutes at 2:30pm on a Saturday.Note: There isn't really any seating inside or outside. I recommend calling your order ahead of time and taking your sandwich to go.
Umph. So goooood. I ordered our lunch on the app I downloaded onto my phone, so I walked in without any wait time. Get the vegan Everett Middle School sammich (yes, I said sammich) with onions on the Dutch Crunch bread. It was DELISH.I repeat... ORDER AHEAD OF TIME TO AVOID THE WAIT.
there's not a whole lot to say about Ike's that hasn't already been said. They make a legit sandwich...you should eat here. often. that is all.
Ike's? Do you really need another review? Oh what the hell. Oh menage a trois. You made me so satisfied, but I still yearn for more every day. Give me some more of that dirty sauce and I'll lick it right off my fingers. The sound of the dutch crunch bread makes me want to keep eating you up. My mouth is salivating just thinking about the memories we had. Infatuation? Nope! It's love!-definitely worth any drive, walk, and visit. GO!p.s.: line goes by fast. You get a nice caramel apple treat in your sandwich bag. I'm still dreaming of you!
They blew it again! Ike's has officially been taken off the list of places our office will ever order from again.This time, they confused Thursday with Friday.Office Manager "Hey, just calling to confirm our office's order is coming soon."Ike's "Ohhhhh, ummmmmm, it says here that your order is for tomorrow........"FAIL!
A must if you're coming to the Bay Area... Sandwiches are BOMB!!!!! I believe it's the bread that makes the sandwiches... Yummy!!! If you haven't went, you should go!n
Reliably good sandwiches with unusual but flavorful combinations. Love the crunch bread! This is NOT a place for a low calorie lunch, though, so if you're watching your weight, don't come here. All that richness and flavor comes from yummy fat!Wish they would start taking phone orders during lunch when it makes the most sense: People are in a rush to make it back to work on time and can't afford to wait in line then wait for their food....let's get with the program Ike's!  I only come during off peak hours, like a very late lunch or early dinner.  If they improved this service, I would give them five stars.
SPIFFY TIFFY!! Best sandwich of my life!It has all the good stuff in one sandwich: chicken, pesto, avocado, mushroom, pepper jack, AND provolone.  If it had bacon then I'd die happy but I'd like to graduate from school soo no added bacon. I got it on the French roll bc I prefer softer bread. SO GOOD!! And definitely go to this location. I think it's the best!TIP: order advance on the phone or get the app onto your smart phone and skip the long line!!
Does anyone really wait in line for this anymore?With popularity comes great responsibility...They've definitely downgraded the quality of their items and raised the prices since my initial eats here. I'm not paying $11 for a vegetarian sandwich made with half-ass ingredients.Step it up, man!
I waited 2 hours for this sandwich. I only kept standing in line since 1) this place may close soon, 2) very popular, 3) i want a good DIRTY sandwich. Ordered the Change (Thinly Sliced RibEye Steak, Beer Battered Onion Rings, BBQ, Smoked Gouda) on a Dutch Crunch. The Dutch Crunch seriously makes the sandwich good. the bread is nicely toasted and this sandwich has everything i love. Meat, BBQ sauce, and Onion Rings. The onion rings lacked crispy-ness. My friend ordered the Hella Fat Bastard (Ham, Mozzarella Sticks, Bacon, EXTRA Dirty Sauce, American). She enjoyed it a lot and really liked the Dutch Crunch as well.The workers will constantly tell you to move close to the wall to avoid blocking the sidewalks. I was lucky enough that during my 2 hour wait someone was sampling Rob's Really Good Chocolate Tea so everyone in line got a free bottle. Sandwiches vary from $9 - $20. A plus is that Ike personally "delivers" your order to you. Yes this sandwich is good...but I won't wait 2 hours for it. Next time I think I'll just order it by phone and then pick up later.
Willie Brown is what I always get here. The chicken breast and barbeque sauce are simply awesome. I work at SF state and I usually opt for Ike's Willie Brown for my lunch. You get many options for the bread but, I always go for the French one. It makes the entire sandwich the best. Also, the best time to go to Ike's during the weekdays is around 2 pm. If you go at around 12 noon, you just have to wait for like 45 minutes to get your order. The queue is actually very long for the quality of Ike's sandwiches. Thumbs up!
Oh Ikes, how I love you. Really, really good sandwiches. Do believe the hype! I always get the Superman w/ xtra Bacon, Avocado and Sauce! So bomb! And yes of course I share lol That thing is heeeecka huge.
The MANAGE A TROIS is a must try. Make sure to select the DUTCH CRUNCH bread. It was my first time there and there was a line out the door! The sandwiches are fresh and delicious! Their honey mustard is light and tasty. I usually don't even like mustard! I will definitely go back to try more of their sandwiches!
Damn that Dirty Secret Sauce...soooooooooooo good...and now that I can get it delivered via Caviar, more Ike's more often.
Absolutely love Ikes Place. Great sandwiches that make your mouth water and fiend for them. The long wait & prices is worth it. Matt Cain & Mnage a Trois got to try.. Lex Luther better have an appetite.
Ike's is great. Lines suck.
Delicious every time!Always be prepared for at least a bit of a wait.The ginger ale they sell here is the bees knees..as are the pickle chips. Nice to get food from here and head to 17th x Castro Jane Warner Plaza to make use of the tables and chairs. Tip to save some time - look up their more extensive menu online and order to pick up!
My friends always say this place is overrated, but I stand by my opinion that this place has the best sandwiches ever!!! It's probably because I'm a vegetarian and they actually HAVE vegetarian options that's not only an overpriced regular sandwich without meat (ugh that makes me so mad!!). I've been here quite a few times, but mostly when people are visiting because I live kinda far away. The wait can be long, but I think it's been improving over the years :).The last two sandwiches I remember getting are The Pilgrim and The Pee Wee. Both of them are AWESOME! The fake turkey tastes kinda like real turkey from what I remember of how real turkey tastes like ahaha. The sandwiches are huge and definitely fill you up :}. You also get a bag of chips and a lollipop on the side :DD. I just ate lunch but man I'm craving Ike's again!!
My boyfriend and I will fly to San Francisco to JUST get Ike's sandwich. This sandwich shop is basically life, and you haven't lived if you haven't eaten an Ike's sandwich.
Top 5 Sandwiches in San Francisco easy
Ok. I'm jumping on the bang wagon. I came here after my disappointing time in the Napa Valley last week, and wow. Such a cool concept with food.
I've had a few of their sandwiches and never went wrong with any of them.
Ditto everyone else. This place has great sandwiches. Each costs about $8-14. Price seems to depend on locations, I think. Get their dutch crunch bread. Also, their dirty sauce is so good, sweet and something something. Can't even describe it.
Unpretentious, greasy, and delicious: the three words I would use to describe this place. I ordered the vegan Handsome Owl--vegan swiss, teriyaki, wasabi mayo, and breaded vegan chicken. It was doused in sauce, and the odd flavor combination worked really well. The sandwich came out quickly even though the place was crowded, and there were even free Blow-Pops included in the bag! What kinda place gives out free Blow-Pops? The answer is: no place but Ike's. If I lived in San Francisco I would eat lunch here all the time.
Looooooove me some Ike's. Whether it be the original in SF, on the Stanford Campus or in Redwood City, you can always count on a really good sandwich at either location. Just pick anything off the menu and go for it! Don't try the same thing twice!
Yummmm! Delicious sandwiches!!! When you order at Ike's, don't expect to eat healthy. Just don't. It's indulgent and delicious and I love it!Definitely get their dutch crunch bread, and then get some of the faves. I really enjoyed the cheesesteak one with jalapeno poppers added. The poppers gave a lovely additional texture to the sandwich. Minus one star cuz I think it's slightly pricey and some of the sandwiches are misses. (One of the 7x7 Big Eats list recced the Menage Trois and I thought it tasted gross! Wayyy too sweet and too many sauces! I hated it! I almost didn't give Ike's another try, but my friend got a vegan sandwich which she gave me a bite of - it was AMAZING so I realized I just got the wrong thing.) Speaking of, their vegan sandwiches are really good too!! And I'm speaking as a non-vegan non-vegetarian person. So even if you're a hardcore meat person, give it a try! You might be pleasantly surprised. Of course, the meat is where the heart is at so I'll usually stick with something meat-y. Don't wait in line! Call in your sandwich order or use their iphone app! Makes life a lot easier. There's an open area with benches where you can eat your sandwich, but if it's a nice day, take the walk to Dolores park and enjoy it in the sunshine.
With over 2600 reviews, there's probably not much more to say. I was visiting San Francisco last weekend and asked my cousin of a place where I could go eat at. She recommends Ike's especially since they were closing shop in a few days due to an eviction notice spawned by angry neighbors.If you stop by during the last few days, I'd probably warn you of the long lines that this place commands. I went around 2pm last Saturday and waited about 2 hours from lining up to getting the food. I'm down to wait for great food but that's way too long. I ended up ordering the "We're Just Friends" sandwich that had halal chicken, sweet orange glaze, avocado, and pepperjack cheese. The sandwich is pretty tasty. I think even better so with the dutch crunch bread that they have. If you get your sandwich here, make sure it's with the dutch crunch. Very nice and chewy. The halal chicken was tasty. The whole sandwich is actually packed with so much flavor. The orange glaze gave it a sweet taste while the pepperjack cheese added some salty flavor. Overall, the sandwich was very good.I'd normally give this place a 4 based on the food alone, but having to wait 2 hours in line for a sandwich made me drop a star in the rating. The long queue made it seem like the food isn't worth it. I would suggest if you were eating here to call in. I believe you have to call ahead an hour in advance and skip the whole line process. If I did that, I'd probably give them a 4 star. The sandwich comes with a side of chips. Drinks are optional. I'd recommend the EMPIRE COLA if you're not familiar with it.Hopefully they get another place in the city. I doubt I'd drive to Stanford to try the sandwiches but would come back if they opened in another location in the future.
Good sandwich but way too wet and soggy for my taste. If I go back, I'll say 'no' to the special sauce. Also, the bacon texture was like it had been microwaved for 30 seconds vs actually cooking it...maybe if you ask for it to be crispy bacon it would make a difference? Other than that, decent prices and great, friendly staff.
I ordered a turkey club with avocado, bacon and jalapeo poppers! My life is almost complete :') we went on a Thursday afternoon so the wait wasn't that long. I'd definitely go back if I'm in Frisco again
Used to be a 5 star place. Now, 3. Been coming here for years since they were at the original location right up the street on Sanchez. I used to always enjoy their sandwiches but lately it seems like their quality in ingredients and craftmanship has declined while their prices have increased. Expect to pay at least $10 for a basic sandwich. Most others are in the $12-15 range. They used to include chips with every sandwich but stopped that a little while ago. I think it's because they're trying to franchise/go corporate so maybe it's a way to increase their margins. I always get one of three sandwiches - the pizzle, the hollywood cheesteak, or hot mama hudda. The pizzle and hot mama have halal chicken which almost always now is very dry. The ribeye for the cheesteak is always dry now too. Expect to wait at least an hour for your sandwich during the lunch rush. It's always been this way and I don't get how they can't seem to make their process more efficient. If you do order online (not during lunch rush), make sure to come a little earlier than the scheduled time because almost every time they are made early, sit around, and get soggy. That's the one gripe I have with Ike's. Their sandwiches can get pretty soggy after only a few minutes wrapped up because they add so much sauce. So eat it quick if you can. If you order online during lunch, don't expect it to be ready on time either. Last few times, I've had to wait an additional 15 minutes while people who were in line ordering got their sandwiches way before me.
Good shop. I am a fan.
Love the food!! The Bella Sandwich is amazing as I'm sure are all their sandwiches.....not crazy about the wait but that's San Francisco for you!
Soggy, over priced, over hyped, and terrible quality ingredients. If you think this is the best sandwich you've ever had then you need better taste buds.
Great sandwiches and definitely delicious. The chips is out of the "bag" and the line is longgggggg.
I've been eating here at least once a week for the past 5 years, and I just can't get enough. Ike's is the best sandwiches in the city, hands down. Amazing sandwiches, great drink selection, and everyone there is very friendly.Sandwich recommendations (all on dutch crunch):* Mnage  trois* We're Just Friends* Super Mario
There's a reason you see so many glowing reviews for this place. The food really is that good. What's more, they offer gluten-free breads. When I requested their GF roll, the cashier did something that no one ever does: "Do you have an allergy?" And when I said yes, he told the kitchen staff about it so that they could do their level best not to cross-contaminate. It's rare enough to go into a sandwich place that even attempts to accommodate what I know to be a relatively rare problem. To find one that really does their best to make sure that I don't get sick while eating their amazing food is really touching. I finally have a sandwich place in this city I can call my own. Thanks, Ikes!
Love the sandwiches and the fun names for them all.
This place is amazing!!!!!! Jessica rabbit was delicious to say the least! Worth the wait! They also have the most incredible chips i have ever tasted go with the spicy voodoo or the cajun dill (CD are my favorite) My boyfriend had the Cain and he absolutely loved it! We will defiantly be back!You guys ROCK! Thank you! See you soon:)
Love this place! Their dutch crunch is yummy and fresh! Definitely a must try if you've never been! The matt cain and lincecum are legit! Aside from their menu on the wall they also have other sanwhiches posted on the pillar and below the counter that look really good too!
Who doesn't like Ike's?! With their new location and three cash registers, the wait is much shorter. I am in love with the Menage a Trois, and tend to order it everytime I come. I have tried the Matt Cain and a bunch of others, but I must say the Menage a Trios is the best one yet. Nice and juicy on a cripsy dutch crunch bread is perfect! Their new choices of chips are interesting. I tried their VooDoo and BBQ + Ranch chips, but love the VooDoo flavor best! Definitely recommend coming here to order the Menage a Trois! Everything else is just not as great :P
Legit the best sandwiches I have ever eaten in my life. The secret sauce is so delicious. I have tried 4 sandwiches from there and none have failed to impress. Also, the chips that come with the sandwich are great. The staff is quirky and the line is super long but definitely worth the wait. Never a bad idea to grab a sandwich and head over to Dolores for an afternoon picnic.
Gluten free bread, delicious sandwiches and something adventurous every single time. We love this place - LOVE LOVE LOVE!
Way over-rated in terms of food quality. Quantity is certainly there which supports the value proposition but I encourage low expectations that a sandwich here is notably better than your average corner bodega. When i see the lines form outside this place, I scratch my head.
The sandwich was HUGE and tasty.They said they opened at 10am but we had to wait till 10:30 since they were having oven problems. I ordered the Lex Luthor and it was a giant. About 4 pounds and is good for maybe 3 people. I was only able to eat a little over 1/4 of it till i was stuffed. Inside of the sandwich are just cheap frozen fried foods but the sauce was very good. It was a little like a thousand island sauce but was a little different. I was happy to try it and would be back again to try different sandwiches in the future.
I wouldn't wait an hour for any other sandwich but Ike's. Every time I have anyone visit me in the city, I have to take them to Ike's and every time I get someone hooked. Last time I took my brother, who had gotten hooked the previous time he visited, and my father w ho thought we were crazy for standing on a side walk for an hour for a sandwich. He ordered "the Change" and although he didn't profess his love for the sandwich that day, six months later he was still talking about it. I don't know what is in that dirty sauce, but my life would not be the same without my number 108!
The Matt Cain sandwich is bomb!!I can't wait to try all the other sandwiches
Yum! My boyfriend and I stopped by here after flying in from San Diego and after I hearing about Ike's Place from a friend. After waiting in line, I believe I ordered their "Meatless Mike" (Vegetarian marinara sandwich). Their "secret sauce" is pretty good! All sandwiches come with a free bag of chips, any of your choice from a selection of "New Orleans" chips.Ike's staff are very friendly, so don't be afraid to ask for suggestions! Their menu is huge... I wish I got to try more than one sandwich.The only reason why I took a star away was because the place was TINY, and there were NO TABLES (it's a place to order to-go, I guess). My boyfriend and I were starving so we just sat on the sidewalk and ate our food. Another reason was because our sandwiches were not hot/warm, I think they would've tasted even more amazing if their sandwiches were fresh out of the oven! Other than that, if you don't mind waiting in line and sitting on a sidewalk for some yummy sandwiches, then you're all set!
Sandwiches were really good but I wouldnt say mind blowing... No seats so we took our food a few blocks up to Deloris Park to enjoy lunch.
I love Ike's! The place is all about producing great sandwiches. It's designed as an order and go. No seating, just a waiting area once you've ordered. You walk in and it's a clean, no frills setup. Cash register, menu, drink case, kitchen in the back. (which you can see is actually pretty extensive) Even the chip display is just boxes that have been opened and stacked. Grab what you ordered then go forth and enjoy.For a place that has gathered such acclaim, if you walked in not knowing the sandwiches I could see how you could have doubts. However, once you sink your teeth in and your taste buds explode with pleasure, you'll get it. I recommend going off hours as the lines can get long. Or better yet order ahead for the quick pick up and run. Well done Ike! Way to create a masterpiece.
Finally got to try this place!! I saw it on Man VS Food for the 1st time and had to come try it. Parking is horrible so try to park at a shopping center a few blocks over and walk there. Trust me you will have a hard time looking for parking otherwise.This place looks simple and small, but that's not the case with their sandwiches. I ordered one from the menu I think it was called the Tiffany, it comes with some chips and a soda. Man o Man! this was a piece of heaven!!! best darn sandwich ever! Fresh and full of flavor, too bad I live 6 hours away otherwise I would be here everyday :(
The line was long and the sandwich was good, but I was surprised that everything was chicken. I think I was hyped up too much, but it was good.
A great place for shy people to order a sandwich without having to feel intimidated and rushed out to order a good sandwich. :D It's my ideal sandwich place.Note: I meant the one for Santa Rosa, haven't tried the San Francisco one.
Best place for the best sandwiches!
WAY WAY WAY over due! The best vegetarian and vegan sandwhichs by far! And I dont mean a ton of veggis (unless you want that). I mean "meaty", cheesy, finger-lickin', good indulgences!
We lucked out a lot this weekend. We avoided lines almost everywhere we went. When we arrived at Ike's we had 3 people in front of us. by the time we ordered there were another 10+ lining up behind us.Wife had a vegan chicken sandwich which she really enjoyed. I had the Paul Ruebens on Dutch crunch. The combo of pastrami, slaw, and dirty sauce was fantastic. I could have eaten 3 more sandwiches if given enough time. Our friends ordered another 4 sandwiches and said all of them were great. I should have gotten extra dirty sauce to bring back to Portland with me.
I have been waiting long to come eat here. I live in Las Vegas and after seeing Ike's place a while back on Man v. Food. I just had to come see what's all the hullabaloo. Let's just say, it lives up to the hype. I would give this five stars but they forgot the avocado on my We're JUST Friends. Besides that, the sandwich was delicious! That dirty sauce is mouth watering. The chicken and orange glaze is something to brag about. To say the least, when I come back to San Francisco. I'm bringing friends and we're going to Ike's Place.
Good sandwiches, though perhaps a bit over-hyped at 5,000+ reviews. It wasn't too busy on a Sunday morning, and we were able to get our sandwiches to-go pretty quickly. My wife had the menage a trois (halal chicken with tons of cheese) and I had the change (barbecue sauce, onion rings, and ribeye). Sandwiches were pretty good, though I don't know that I'd trek across the city to get one.Was bit disappointed to see that the chips have trans fats. There are lots of equally-delicious kettle chips out there that aren't a death wish.
I've known Ike for several years and he's really done a fabulous job establishing a great sandwich deli. The sandwiches are delicious and although the lines literally out the door to get a sandwich, his team provides quick and excellent service, delicious food, and a smile.
All right. I am impressed. Thank you, Ike!I found a problem with my sandwich and never got a refund. Ike reached out to offer a replacement. Menage a trois on dutch crunch (a true replacement!) was had. He wasn't there that day, but the staff didn't even need to look at Ike's message. Very nice about it, didn't make me feel weird about mentioning a free replacement. I did feel a little self-conscious about it; I've had two other offers for revisit/replacement meals but I couldn't bring myself to do it. Ike's is a bit easier, you're not sitting down at a pricey place. Plus it was a replacement rather than a freebie.Good smitch, operations seems to be faster; a peek into the kitchen reviewed that all staff indeed had hair pulled back, tied up.Still delicious as ever.
Excellent sanwiches! Very tasty, the choices that Ike's offers are great.The only down side I would say that the turn around time is rather slow. But that is to be expected from a place with very long lines that is always popping. I recommend the manage a trois.
Sandwich = 4Service = 4Price = too muchWait time = ridiculous Sandwich was good but so big that I had to rip bits and pieces off to eat. For two people + two drinks our total was almost $40 which seemed outrageous to me, even if they throw in a bag of chips to hold you over while you wait 30 minutes for your food to be prepared. The wait was out of control, both to order the sandwich and to have it made, I don't think I would ever do that again, at least not on the weekend. I might try ordering for pick-up next time but the price, oh the price, is it really worth it?
Ike's Place never disappoints my appetite when I'm starving for a creative and delicious sandwich! Tried the Super Mario (meatballs, marinara sauce and mozzarella sticks) sandwich today and it was a flavorful Italian sensation to my taste buds! However, I could care less for the lollipop though. Until next time!
I'll admit I was skeptical it could live up to the hype when I saw Ike's on Man vs. Food and on the 7x7 list but these sandwiches are the best. But, after a visit, this is the best sandwich shop I've ever been to. This was the fifth stop on the 7x7 one day adventure and there was a short line at 5:41p on a Saturday which was perfect for calling in 45 minutes ahead of time and then picking it up pronto. We swooped by and met up my sister who got us the sandwiches (so nice) and we drove to nearby Dolores park to have an impromptu picnic with our sandwiches. It was nice to sit on the grass on a sunny day and scarf down these sandwiches. Even if you have to fend off the occasional puppy that wants in on these sandwiches. Menage a Trois - Man, what a sandwich name for a sandwich that tastes as good as guys fantasize an actual menage a trois to be. Plus, no awkwardness in asking for it!Change- The "Do You Smell What Barack is Cooking?" plus beer-battered onion rings which equals awesome. Sometimes change is good, sometimes it's bad. This time, it's very, very good.Unoriginal - Putting pastrami in one of these sandwiches is so simple yet so satisfying. I'd recommend it. Ike's is a must-visit for big, delicious sandwiches with amazing ingredients such as the Dutch Bread that you have to try. I will definitely be back to try the Kryptonite.
Great sandwiches, rad staff, and Gluten-Free Bread(which is delicious). All in all a great experience.Ike is quite the character as well!
The first time I ever had Ike's was two years ago. My friend was so passionate about it that he drove from San Mateo to Foster City during his lunch break after buying Ike's to get me to try it. He ordered the Menage A Trois -- BEST TASTING SANDWICH I've ever had. Although, I actually felt very unhealthy after eating it because of all the rich ingredients and the huge portions. I just tried it again this past week at the original one in Castro (SF). Tried the Spiffy Tiffy this time. NOMNOM my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Gotta come back and try everything on the menu.
Great sandwiches in Walnut Creek!
Amazing sandwiches, delicious flavor, lots of ingredients and they even have vegan options. When you order for delivery you get some cute lollipops. Recommend it.
I love love love Ike's. You can't go wrong with any sandwich, but you HAVE to get it on the dutch crunch bread. Don't try to be all healthy and get it on wheat, please. The dirty sauce on the rest of the sandwich will cancel it out. My problem with Ike's is that literally every single time my friends from out of town visit, they are closed for whatever reason. For the past two years. Also, there's some weird drama going on with the LA location. Doesn't matter to me as long as they open a Ike's down there ASAP.
These sandwiches are absolutely delicious. I've never had a better sandwich in the SF area. The Stanford kids are spoiled to have this on their campus. Every sandwich is unique and every location has unique names for the sandwiches. I would recommend them all!
Ike's sets the standard for sandwiches. You must order it on the Dutch crunch bread regardless of which sandwich you choose. Expect to wait if you haven't called or ordered ahead of time. San Francisco staple; IMO the other spin off locations are not as good.
Best sandwich I have ever had. Nothing more. Nothing less.I got the Lex Luthor which had all of my favorite things in the world ... all in one place. You wouldn't think they would go together but somehow it was like magic. This place is personally a Michelin two star in that I would consider (if I could afford it) fly across the country just to eat there. Now I'm hungry ....
I love food a lot, but when I see/smell/taste Ike's, I am overcome with so much emotion that tears have been known to surface. Overreaction? I think not.And it is all over one sandwich: vegetarian meatless Mike with all veggies on wheat. I can't bear to try another sandwich, because the vegan meatballs + marinara sauce combined with the crunch of the vegetables and the nutty bread is beyond words. It is huge and perfect (that's what she said), and there will be no better sandwich ever.No 45 minute line can keep us away!!P.S. To other lowly interns in the city, they deliver.
Pro
love it
Yum.
Yummy!

SO GOOD

Looking for a sandwich to suit almost any occasion? Enter Ike's Place. The small sandwich shop situated in Castro (and several other large neighboring cities) has almost no seating but plenty to eat. Whether you're hungry for meat, veggies, or both, Ike's has quite a lengthy selection to choose from...whether written on the menu, a post-it note, a wall sign, or just your very own customized order. The sandwiches are heated, mildly pressed, and served with any number of sauces that drip down your chin and onto your lap, if you aren't careful. Napkins became our best friend as we indulged on quite the colorful and loaded up Reuben Sandwich.
sammichhow can you go wrong. IKE's never dissapointsDownside is waiting for it.
I ordered the Paul Rubens and although the sandwich tasted amazing their wasn't nearly enough meat for $10. I prefer deli board down the street for a real man size sandwich. I would come here again if in the area and hungry.
Was on Man vs food show, great sandwiches but it's a little higher on price but well worth it. There are long lines so be prepared to wait. Or call in your order...you are welcome for the tip!! hahahah
Pro tip: Download the Ike's app (or at least write down their phone number and call your order in).Ike's is good. REAL good. And you know this because the line is consistently out the door and around the corner. On a recent weekend excursion to Dolores Park, I finally got smart and ordered my sandwich from the app while still in bed. 3 hours later when I arrived at Ike's en route to the park, my sandwich was ready and paid for, and I just winked at those poor suckers in line while they cried.The Jaymee Sirewich is personal fave. Add avocado. Bring napkins.
One of my favorite sandwich places. Halal chicken is always good. Paul reubens is another great sandwich. Lines aren't too bad and as always worth the wait. Also, free chips!
One of a kind -- simply phenomenal.
As good as everyone says. Easily the best thing I ate while on my SF vacation. Will definitely go again next time I visit.
Today was a big day.I was introduced to "Shawn Michaels," embraced "Change," danced with "Hot Momma Huda," and was nearly suffocated by a "Fat Bastard" before watching Michael Buble.I won't go on and on about how delicious everything was. Suffice to say, this is THE place to stop for a sandwich (with extra dirty sauce).
This is a biased review. Why? Ike names his sandwiches after San Francisco sports stars, especially Giants. That's good enough for 3 stars alone, but luckily the sandwiches are five stars on their own. The bread is always delicious, the toppings are sinfully good, and the dirty sauce...dirrrrty. Just plain unfair to other sandwich shops. I try to get something new each time, but at least every other order is my beloved Harbaughcalypse. No regrets.Minus one star for opening in LA. If you're playing at home, that's still 7 stars.
OMG. I can never eat another sandwich without comparing it to Ike's, ever again! I came here with my friend, and got the 1/2 spiffy tiffy, and the change.The spiffy tiffy was so good! It tasted like pizza. It had pesto, avocado, provolone, mushroom, and shredded halal chicken.The Change had bbq sauce, sliced steak, onion rings, and I forgot what else. Honestly, ANY sandwich here will taste good. So just go with whatever toppings and such you like. They're all so delicious!!While I was eating, the wind was blowing everywhere. Napkins blew away, hair was getting into my sandwich, sauce was dripping everywhere, I was eating paper....but I just kept on eating like it was the end of the world!
God this place is soooo amazing. I came back on Thursday and ordered the Sometimes a Vegetarian which was DELICIOUS. Tonight I'll try get something different, but I dunno if I can stray from a good thing. A great thing really. And PS if you order aruond 6-7 PM (at least on a Thursday) you get a free drink and chips for happy hour!! And the line is nonexistent.Still the best sandwich I've ever had. In my life. Ever.Update: We went and I had a bite of the Mobile Momma so EFFING GOOD. Now I know that I have to try everything on the menu - I can't limit myself to just the one sandwich I've had here. The staff also entertained us with trivia and playful banter. Fun times!! And GREAT sandwiches. You haven't even lived till you've had one of these. OMG sooooo effing goooooood.
As far as sandwiches go, it's one o the best in the City!
Ike's place is becoming a staple to San Francisco's top spots to try. With an array a catchy names for their sandos, why wouldn't anyone want to satisfy their curiousity to try Ike's."Menage a trois" was my picking and I can't help but get a watery mouth just even thinking about it. The sando-pretty huge filled with all the fixings- chicken, mustard, lettuce, tomato, and bacon. The only downside to Ike's would probs be the long wait to get to order a sando. Do yourself a favor, call in and order ahead.
Not really open for new things but my girlfriend is such a foodie,she's always raving & ranting about Vietnamese food and it so happens she works by this spot they been open for probably a month now. Def loved the beef cube rice bowl & her favorite the pork mi sandwich, staff friendly place is clean and its very affordable def in mood for it will be stopping by tomorrow, p.s. she loves there iced coffees also don't sleep on the kimchi fries I had a order to go.
The sandwiches are sooo good, but the service and wait is soooo bad. And they keep messing up my sandwiches. In person and when I use the app they mess up my order way more often then they get it right, and I have to check every time before I leave. The sandwiches really are amazing though, it's one of those places that doesn't have to get everything right because people will still come back. I would come back wayyy more if they didn't keep making mistakes. Don't ever go if you're in a hurry. Save it for a day off when you have nothing to do.
19-May, SundayMatt Cain was a savory meat trinity of roast beef, turkey, salami, with creamy provolone, I only wonder what the rich God Father sauce really contains, so I am not even going to bother asking. Gobs of heaping goodness served on the perfect sandwich bread -the Dutch Crunch roll! Which has a crackly exterior, and airy interior, that was sweet yet slightly yeasty in taste. The final sandwich presented to me was densely compact; I don't think I even detected a single pocket of air. But of course, as soon as I had brought this monster home I had drizzle some Tabasco for a tinge of heat & vinegar. AND: who could go wrong with complementary chips of various flavors (I always go for the Dill)TIP: Save yourself from standing in this insane line by putting in your order ahead of time.
The staff is always very friendly and has great suggestions on what to get.Haven't had a sandwich I didn't like from here.
Hmmmmmmm...... What can I say about Ike's Place.....other than that $&%$ was effin magic in my mouth! Everything on the menu (and off), and I do mean everything, is made with the freshest and tastiest ingredients around. Not only that, he puts the sandwiches together in the funkiest, most eclectic mad-hatter combinations that I've ever seen; and lets just say I've been eatin' sandwiches since before you were born! I love trying new places out, and being something of a connoisseur, I've been to quite a few, let me tell you, and Ike's is by far, hands down takes the cake, cuts the mustard, or whatever else you wanna say; basically, In laymen terms, they're the best!!!!I ordered the Kryptonite and let's just say it came as advertised; I came, I saw, I got conquered, by 4lbs of sandwich. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone not getting their last meal before going on a hunger strike, or for anybody not fully prepared to go into a food coma and then give birth afterwards (cause that's exactly what happened).
Awesome sandos. This place is no frills and did I mention the sandos are awesome!  Betty and I shared the (name of the girl I'm dating) and I could have eaten the entire thing myself. The halal chicken was moist and the avocado blended perfectly with the pepper jack and honey mustard. If I lived in SF I would eat here once a week. Great service and you get a caramel apple sucker as well as a bag of your choice Zapp's chips.
The sandwiches on the menu may sound pretty generic, but they are so flavorful and delicious I can't wait to go back! Tried the turkey/ham/bacon/avocado and it was so good. my friend had the Meatless Mike with vegan meatballs that tasted like excellent and savory regular meatballs. Worth the wait and lived up to the hype!
Wow, I've been to this place several times and surprised I haven't written a review of it. This place has some really good sandwiches. Everything I've tried so far was pretty good. They give you a bag of chips with your order too. Its usually crowded but the line moves pretty quickly though
I hate giving one or two stars but this place really skimps on the roast beef. They did fix it after i complained abotu a $10 sandwich with 2 strips of roast beef. Funny thing is when i ordered it, the guy beside me was complainign about IKE actually being on his cell phone making sandwiches at the same time...slightly unhygenic, never saw it but laughed about it...then i complained and told the guy...i dont wanna be that guy but for $5 at subway i can get a pretty good sammy while here get double charged and no beef.Seriously...wheres the beef.
It's a sandwich. No matter what you do or how you slice it, it's not going to compare to eating at Gary Danko. The best any sandwich shop could ever do is thus probably three stars. And they're great. But -- uhh -- it's just toppings and two slices of bread. It's not going to cure your grandma's Alzheimers, it's not going to bring your pet schnauzer back from the dead. It's a frigging sandwich.Long lines, rough around the edges feel. Not something I'd go out of my way for. I've had better sandwiches too, but not too often.
Well.... it's such a sandwich. I just don't see what other people see in these sandwiches I guess..? Nothing to rave about, and probably won't visit Ike's on a regular basis. I shared a Matt Cain (#18) with a friend since the sandwiches are massive here! If you're not hungry, then I suggest you share one. I could barely finish my 1/2 sandwich. It also comes with a bag of chips (kettle chips! not your typical Lay's chips...) and a lollipop, nice touch! Very cute indeed :) However, these sandwiches don't come cheap like at your local deli markets.. most are around $10. The Matt Cain consisted of various deli meats, cheese, and the "godfather sauce". I felt that all the ingredients were mediocre, I mean it's not like they're using the highest quality meats and cheeses in these sandwiches. Also, I was not a big fan of their sauce, since I'm not into mayo-based sauces. There was SO MUCH of this "godfather sauce" that it just overpowered everything in the sandwich! All I could taste was the mayo in the sauce... which I believe didn't go well with the meats and cheeses in the sandwich.
My favorite Sandwich place so far!! My Suggestions are to try the Mnage  trois and Name of Girl I'm Dating lol SUPERB is the word for this hole in the wall. The only bad thing I can think of is that there's always a line, so you have to get there early.Ask for Dutch Crunch bread on any of your sandwiches!! yum =)
Oh Ike's. I loved you three years ago when I had my first bite of a Menage a Trois and I love you still after my past weekend in San Francisco. There's honestly not much I can add that hasn't already been said about this place. I just have one tip: if you want to take the sandwich home on a plane, remember to ask for the dressings to be put on the side and don't bother adding lettuce and tomatoes. The vegetables are the main culprits behind the bread getting soggy. Now enjoy gobbling your sandwich (on dutch crunch bread, of course) while other passengers stare at you enviously. It's a wonderful feeling.
This review is just for my order today 12.29.14. I placed my order at 12:16pm. We placed the order to be ready for pick up at 12:30 pm. I go up to the pick up counter and the girl there looks at her iPad for the pick up orders online. She says "oh, I haven't put that order in yet." So....if I had not gone up there, it Probably would have not gotten out in at all until later. What would be the point of ordering through the app. That's the reason we did that as to avoid waiting in line and to get our order when the all said it would be ready. At 12:36 I asked her how long it would be, she said in about 10min. So essentially we have been waiting oh about 1/2hr already for our food? Not good business practice with the app. Orders in the app should be put in at least 5 min after, not 15 min later only when your customer comes up to you. It's going on almost 35 min.....I think I'll stick to the walnut creek location on the weekends instead and vow to not come back to this one.
Amazing SF staple. One of my favorite places for a picnic sandwich to bring to Dolores Park, just divine.
3 star for good sandwich...-2 star for lack of customer service... Also please have some tables in your place.
How do the ways I count how I love thee?1. Your fresh ingredients2. The size of your sandwich3. The super dutch crunch bread4. The free chips5. The free caramel apple lollipop6. The new location7. The amazing staff8. The fried chicken sandwich9. The Spiffy Tiffy10. Fresh halal meat11. The special sauce12. The closeness to Dolores Park13. The attention to detail and care you put into each and every sandwhich....and so much more.I love taking your sandwiches, and enjoying the rare moments of warm weather and sunshine at Dolores park.
Ike's is a great place to stop by and grab a sandwich to go.My love and I ordered the Matt Cain sandwich to share on our way to Delores Park. It was jut the right amount for the two of us. Their sandwiches are BOMB! Oh and every sandwich comes with complementary chips.Only reason why it doesn't get the full five stars is because they didn't have enough seating space during our wait. The interior of this place is a bit disorganized, but other than that... Our bellies were HAPPY :)
OMG Best Sandwiches ever. I used to work for Wells Fargo on Market and Church and these guys always took care of us. I remember Alex as well because he always hooked us up and since we order over the phone we didn't have to wait in line, but just pick our stuff. Hands down the Manajatwa chicken sandwich is my favorite. I haven't tried all of them but i definitely want to. See u guys soon!
These are THE BEST dirty sandwiches I've ever had. Ike's sandwiches are probably not very good for your waistline, but they will make your tastebuds EXPLODE!They have a huge selection of sandwiches, plus some "secret" ones that aren't listed. If you're in San Francisco this is a landmark place that you must try at least once.
I give this place a 3 star due to the fact that its a small operation with too many customers. It will take you 30 mins if you're lucky to get out of there during lunch hour and not to mention parking. Approx. 40 mins just to get your sando!The sandos are great but the overall service and effort it takes to order is a bit lacking. I stood in line for 15-20 mins., there are two lines, one for pick up with phone orders being taken and another for walk-up orders. Obviously, walking up will take quite some time as I learned that phone orders take priority. As I finally made it up to the front of the line after about 6 people ordered, the cashier began taking calls and spoke on the phone for 5-10 mins and then started servicing people that would come to pick up their orders which really annoyed me because all I wanted to do was to put in my order. The clerk never acknowledged me even after he was finished helping the two guys that walked in to pick up their order, he then proceeded to go in the back leaving the front unattended and seemed like he was searching for orders to bring to the front. The waiting area is small and filled with people so you probably might want to wait outside. Overall this place produces some delicious sandos but the attempt at getting sando is exhausting. Would I go back during non-peak hours? Sure. Would I go back for lunch probably not. Too much of a hassle.
While there is no place to sit and eat here, it's still worth the trip! I had 1/2 of the Matt Cain (Fantastic) & 1/2 of the Damon Bruce (Great). I really liked both of them, but liked the Matt Cain smidge better. But there were so many other options that I've got to try as well - I'll be back for sure!
I hella forgot what I got, I think it was the menage a trois. Anyway.. Definitely a must try. Countless unique and creative sandwiches. Place is small but who's complaining. Lots of graffiti and vandalism in the bathroom. A few homeless people out front. And a great staff. Shout out to the cashier who helped my friend and I, very friendly! Part of my top ten best sandwiches.
Okay, so obviously Ike's is delicious. you don't need me to tell you something you could have easily deduced yourself. So here's some things you may not know...1. online ordering: just do it. i have no idea why people insist on waiting in that egregious line when there's this glorious thing called online ordering. clearly you are yelping, so you didn't just stumble upon ike's by happenstance - plan ahead folks! they have a cool website where you can place your order and pay, so that all you have to do is literally pick up your sandwich upon arrival. 2. menage a tois is hands down the best sandwich for you meat eaters out there. it's insanely delicious, and yep you guessed it... insanely unhealthy. i mean... three types of cheese?! but it's okay. go ahead and splurge knowing that Ike's is a once a year indulgence.:)
Ike's Place is amazing. The first time my husband and I went was part of our food tour. We walked over to Duboce Park and split a "Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian". It was so deliciously messy. There is such a wide selection of sandwiches the next time I went I ordered the exact same sandwich. My husband ordered the "Spiffy Tiffy" and said it was great. We always go out of our way to this place when we catch a game at AT&T park.
Ike's is one of the best sandwich places in the entire bay area. This location in the heart of the Mission is a small little shop. Parking is hard to come by and the door is usually out the door, but you can subvert all that by phoning in your order ahead of time. I called in my order and was able to go directly to the take-out cashier and pay right away. I was in and out within 5 minutes and did not have to wait around. Most of all they were very friendly and accommodating to my sandwich ingredient requests.I had the Spiffy Tiffy on Dutch Crunch (must try this bread!) and it lived up to all of the hype and expectations. A pretty dense sandwich packed with flavor and a balance to not make it overwhelming. It's definitely worth trying if you're in SF and its one of the better locations (in terms of quality). Best of all, you get chips with your sandwich order (try the jalapeno flavor) as well as caramel apple pops (love those)!It's definitely a must-go-to-place if you're in the Bay Area. Locals and tourist like it and you will too!
Effing delicious sandwiches
The super mario sandwich got me chasin the princess tho
Best sandwich I've ever had. Manage a trois. The drinks, chips and Lilly pop gave a cute touch. Great service. A not-to-be-missed stop off
Really good sandwiches and the best selection of chips.
Kinda pricey, but the sammiches are delicious (and not wimpy!). Service is friendly and fast (so don't worry too much about the line). Get extra napkins. Seriously.Oh also, one more piece of advice - if you haven't been before, try checking out their menu on the website before you go in, so you have an idea of what you want. The beautiful chalkboard with all the sammich magnificence can be intimidating if you don't have a long wait in line with a good view of all the drool-worthy choices (they like to be creative with their custom creations here). Alternatively, you could just close your eyes and pick, because everything's great.
Always yummy and delicious
I'm a fan, but they could use better quality ingredients that are both more sustainable and non-gmo.
Long wait and too much sauce on the sandwiches.
Why do I even write a review for this place? At around 5,000 reviews I feel like there's no point, but I wanted to give a few tips: 1. CALL IN... You will wait in line for a LONG TIME esp. during the dinner/lunch rush. CALL. 2. dutch crunch.3. ...that's it, actually.Overall: I love sandwiches. They're pretty much my favorite food. Honestly though, I think however that the quality of ingredients are just so-so. They make up for that by having crazy concoctions and a plethora of different flavor profiles. Things I've tried: Thanksgiving dinner sando- turkey, cranberry, sriracha = goodHot momma huda: my fave. I love buffalo wings, so.. this is a must if you're a lover of Franks Hot sauce and halal chicken. Simple, yet..so buffalo-ey..drool.An equal favorite was the Backstabber, which includes halal chicken, marinated artichoke hearts, ceasar and provolone. It gives you the...illusion that you're eating a "lighter" sandwich because it has artichokes in it... so you can trick yourself. Either way, I think that it's a good place, but the whole waiting in line thing is lame. Definitely CALL your order in. I'd give it a 3 star just because I wasn't completely wowed by the sandwich (I'm a fan of Guigni's in St. Helena though) but 4 stars definitely because the workers were FANTASTIC and so incredibly nice.
BEST SANDWICHEVEROnce my bf and I arrived a little after 1pm, we knew we were stuck. We could leave now after seeing this 50ppl long line. But we were serious about trying this place out. 4.5 stars, 2000+ reviews. what could go wrong?Quite a lot actually. We had to sacrifice pretty much the whole of saturday's travel plans to eat this. By the time we got our sandwiches, it was nearly 3pm (1.5 hrs wait!). Making it a very unproductive Saturday (No golden gate park, no MOMA)But we did get to enjoy the wonders of these sandwiches. How is it so good? They passed the menu back while we were in line. I was recommended the Menage a trois, which had halal chicken, honey, honey mustard, bbq, pepperjack , swiss, smoked gonda. Asked for avocado which they forgot. At $11.11, it may sound a little pricey, but it's WELL worth it! The sandwich is pretty big. SUPER STUFFED and INCREDIBLY FILLING! The sandwich, was a monster. they do not skimp! Dripping, but not exactly an overload on sauce, makes it a delightful lunch! The cheese was perfectly melted and stretchy. The dressing/dirty sauce accompanies the sandwich wonderfully. They also put veggies like onions, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, peppers, as you like. Comes with a pack of kettle cooked chips and a caramel apple lollipop (Too sour)My bf's superman (which we both preferred) with roast beef, corned beef, pastrami, salami, turkey, bacon, ham, avocado and jack was really, well, superman. SO GOOD. A LOT OF MEAT. it was like double the size of my sandwich! Eating the sandwiches was very messy, but worth every bit of the price, maybe not the wait. They really need to open another location! Especially for travelers who have better things to do than to wait over an hour for a sandwich! Bring this to LA! Where i will have nothing better to do than to wait.***Tip: They have wireless! Call in if you know what you want. they DO have 100+ sandwiches, so look online. I don't think you can really go wrong wit any of them. Calling in will still take like 2 hours. so call in ahead of time. St parking sucks, but it's not too bad, a lot of people leave. Around the corner, you can definitely find metered parking. There's also no seats, so be prepared to eat outside/in your car/at home.Favourites: No skimping! Awesome sandwich.Do not want: long wait.Last words: Beautifully made, a little pricey.
Best sandwich in the city, and maybe ever. I get Ike's any time I am in San Francisco. It is my religion. It should be yours. Ike Shedadeh deserves every 5 star he gets. His story is amazing, his sandwiches are better. Be prepared to wait, and then never feel the same about any sandwich ever again. I suggest The Madison Bumgarner, Name of the Girl I'm Dating, Matt Cain. But they're all so good. You can't go wrong.
02.15.10It was the end to a long and glorious weekend. I had just gone hiking. I am starving (what's new?).My beast of a friend Q suggested Ike's. Neither of us has ever been. I jumped at the chance. I really wanted to see what Man vs. Food was all about. I wanted to catch a glimpse of Ike. But most of all, I wanted to check another item off the 7x7 list. Yes, I wanted the menage a trois.I'm not a big fan of sandwiches. Something about bread and too much carbs just turn me off. But I had no trouble wolfing these bad boys down. Must be their dirty sauce in the works.The lines at the end of their day (they now close at 7:00 p.m.) aren't that bad. We tried calling in, but they stopped taking phone orders. We waited probably 20 minutes total. But well worth it! They also have superb customer service. I feel for the girl who has to stand out in the cold with the cash register :( Yet she is still so peppy. Much props!I wanted the menage a trois [yelp.com/biz_photos/dold. Yelp reviews suggested the Name of Girl I'm Dating, which we had trouble repeating [yelp.com/biz_photos/dold. We got to the front and were ready to pay, and decided to add a third - the Nacho Boy Supreme [yelp.com/biz_photos/dold. Best.Decision.Ever!Hoard some napkins, find a comfy seat, and get to grubbin'!
This was listed on one of the places to visit in SF, so I came here with my friend. Waited in line for like almost 2 hours and I wasn't even THAT happy with the sandwiches. Both my friend and I split the Kryptonite and Meatball Sub. It was cool that the Kryptonite basically had everything you'd want in a sandwich in this sandwich, but I just felt like it was just a hodge podge full of meat and stuff... Don't get me wrong, it was good, but for the price I'd prefer some place else where I don't have to wait almost 2 hours for a sandwich.
Their sandwiches are inexplicably delicious. Make sure you get your sandwich with dutch crunch bread and their dirty sauce. Always amazing!Just fyi, every time I've come to this location, it's packed, so plan on a good 10-25 minute wait for your food (not that bad).
Wow! How did I miss this place for so long. I search on Yelp for best place for lunch and Ike's came up. So I took the Muni over. First I discovered it's take out only. But fortunately the weather was nice and Dolores Park is only 2-3 blocks away.This is MY kind of sandwich place!!!! I'm not a fan of deli's where they have all the ingredients and they make you tell them everything you want on the sandwich. Rather, I want them to give me a few choices of their creations. And no, not boring "club sandwich", "blt", "ruben", etc. I want something original. Well, Ike's delivers in spads!!! Every sandwich is unique to Ike's. I've been back 3 more times already, tried a different one each time and they've all been amazing!I think Ike's is probably the best sandwich place I've been to in my entire life.
Best sandwich combo spot in all of san francisco! They have really interesting combos of ingredients in a sandwich!Also their names for the sandwiches are super playful and fun. The sandwich I always got was the "Going Home for Thanksgiving" sandwich which has ingredients including: Cranberry Sauce, Havarti, Sriracha, Turkey. It is so grand!I recommend this as a must go to for sandwiches in san francisco. Although there is always a line, they are usually fast.
Hands down one of the most yummiest places to get a sandwich :)It's usually pretty busy, so the wait can be a bit long, but it's totally worth it it once you take a bite out of any sandwich here. There's a wide variety of sandwiches, and it caters to any kind of sandwich eater. Each sandwich is also complemented with a bag of Dirty Chips, which are also super delish!The sandwiches can be a tad bit pricey, but if you're willing to spend on filling sandwiches, then this is definitely the place to be!
Amazing sandwiches!! The line was long on a Saturday at 1pm... and only got longer after we got on line. The wait was totally worth it though. The sandwiches are huuuuge... and soooo tasty!
omg... everything the other 1810 reviews say is TRUE!!Sooo what can I add that has not already been said?!?I got there this morning about 11 a.m... only two people in linein front of me. People read the menus and pass them backin line. You order at a cash register set up in front of the door.Looking inside, there is barely room for the army of artisans making the sandwiches...kinda cramped!I ordered a #88... the Superman, extra dirty.  OMG, my sandwich was soooo HUGE, I think they made a mistake. I swear there was 3 pounds of meat on it. Like 4 or 5 different kinds of meat?  And the weird think was I could actually taste the different flavors of the meats.I really have to find out if my sandwich was supposed to be thatbig or they made a mistake...it was wrapped as two separate sandwiches in my bag.. sooo I had one for lunch and one fordinner!...what a concept, huh? ;)Folks, they use only TOP QUALITY ingredients!  This is a firstclass operation.My only regret.. that I have to drive 85 miles to have an Ike'ssandwich.  But I will do it again... and again...and again!!p/s  since there were 244 photos of sandwiches and only two pics of the suckers, I posted a photo of my sucker!
Very sad. I've always heard about ikes. There's always so much hype about this place....it did not live up to my expectations. The sandwich i had was awful and slimy. For almost 11 bucks....the sandwich was also very flat and not worth even five bucks. I highly recommend going to lous instead, where the quality and prices are much better...as well as cleaner
Very big hardy sandwiches that I can never finish in one sitting. I am a fan of the menage trois - the blending of the sauces is mindblowing. The wait can be super long but you can call in and place your order and they will let you know when you can come pick it up. Don't forget to sign up on their website to become a member. You get to unlock super secret menu items!Solid sandwich place indeed.
This is truly as good as a sandwich will ever get. The ingredients are fresh, the meat is served warm, and oh man that dirty sauce! This is a place worth standing in line an hour for, maybe even two. I love it!
I have been avoiding this place for awhile.. from what I hear the wait is just too long. However, when a friend of mine whom I get to see quite infrequently wanted to go to Ike's, I could not avoid this place any longer.Parking was easy to find and the entire wait was about 45 minutes in the hot sun. I ordered the Eli Manning on dutch crunch and an Honest Tea. Total was about $13. $9 for a sandwich is pretty steep, and $4 for an Honest Tea?!?! Shiet..The sandwich was very saucy and I have to admit, it was delicious. The chicken breast.. the creamy garlic and herb sauce.. the avocado.. the mushrooms.. the cheddar cheese.. all of it came together to become the perfect sandwich. Half of it was more than enough to fill me up, though it wasn't very big.I shall see you again, Ike.. and I'm definitely going to phone in next time.
After having over 5000 positive reviews, I do not think my review will make a difference about how DELICIOUS ike's is! There is a board of their best selling sandwiches, but if you are looking for more options, check out their online menu or reviews on yelp. I have tried --- Menage a Trois, Damon Bruce, and Backstabber.I would suggest Menage A Trois - the HALAL chicken is seasoned perfectly and all ingredients in this sandwich go together so well. They have the BEST sandwich bread I have tasted - the dutch crunchFree bag of chips with each sandwich!Best sandwiches in SF. No sandwich shop in OC or SD could compare.Quick tips:- prepare to stand in line. try to go the first 30 minutes they are open - 10AM - have a place in mind to eat your sandwich at. There are no tables here to eat at. Just buy and go
Never seen such a creative menu for sandwiches! Deff the best sandwich joint I've ever been to. I ordered the Pee Wee to split with my sister who's vegan and I can say that the price does not even matter because this place is amazing. We ordered to go and ate it at Dolores. Great location to eat an awesome sandwich.
YUM! I came here with my cousin for the first time and was finally able to see what the rave was about with this place and by golly it was AH-MAZ-ING& it does disappoint.We had trouble finding parking, but that did not stop us from coming here. Coming here was worth the trouble. It was my first time here, so i did not know what to order, I've read the yelp reviews and scanned through the pictures of kind of sandwich to get. But I was completely stumped. The girl at the cashier reccomended me the ELVIS and the MENAGE a TROIS. I decided to go with the menage a trois on the Dutch bread, this comes with a bag of chips. The menage a troi was soooooooo GOOD!This sandwich is filled with juicy chicken that makes your mouth water just by looking at it, the bbq sauce complements the sandwich along with the crunchy bread. It is simply genius. My cousin got the Elvis on dutch bread and oh boy was that was amazing too. Dont let the word wasabi scare you away! I bet you even Elvis himself would like this. The wasabi was not strong at all infact it added character and flavor to this sandwich. Try it, you have nothing to lose and youll be surprised!Great serviceGreat SANDWICHESawesome experience I will be definitly be coming back here when I VISIT SF. its a must!
Nothing I write about this place hasn't been written already. This place is beyond amazing. The first place my husband and I went to on vacation while in SF. My only regret is not coming back before we left. Took a taxi from our hotel and the driver raved about it. I was so excited. I already knew what I wanted because I looked up the menu before arriving. Once we got there we were instantly told there was no chicken which is the only meat I eat. I almost cried BUT they did have vegan chicken which for me is just as good. So then I was happy.I got the [Name of Girl I'm Dating] which is halal chicken, honey mustard, avocado, pepper jack on dutch crunch. It is $9.99 for the sandwich and after eating it, I would have paid $19.99 for it. My mouth was in heaven. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing.My husband got something with pastrami and he too was overjoyed. There isn't anywhere to sit except a couple random chairs here and there inside and some outside but we took our sandwiches and walked around the block and ate on the curb. The place was jammed packed the whole time we were there. After eating that sandwich, I know why.The caramel apple lollipop they give you for dessert was just so cute.Overall the next time I am in SF, Ike's is where I will be first.
I came here after seeing it on Man v. Food with soaring expectations, and to be honest, it didn't quite live up to the hype. Yes, they have like a million sandwiches on the menu, yes the counter girl is cute and super-friendly, yes Ike himself came out, introduced himself and shook my hand, but the food? Well, to put it mildly, their sandwiches were like one of those small packages that was wrapped in five other bigger packages -- except the smallest package at the end was totally worth it. I walked in here with my roommate right after playing 2hrs of basketball, and immediately noticed two things:1. I was a little underdressed.2. The guy-girl ratio was way skewed toward the guy end of the curve, and me coming here with my male roommate wasn't exactly sending out very... heterosexual vibes, if you catch my drift.Anyway, after placing our orders we took a seat at the elevated platform near the tail-end of Lime. Some 8-9 minutes later my menage a trois arrived, complete with spicy jalapeno kettle chips and a lollipop. The sauce on my sandwich was nothing like I've ever had before; I normally don't like honey or any sort of sweet sauce, but it really worked for the menage a trois; the only problem with the sandwich was that the sauce completely overpowered the other ingredients of the sandwich--I actually don't remember whether my sandwich actually contained any chicken or not, since I couldn't really taste it. My roommate ordered the Just Friends sandwich, which yielded a similar experience.Overall I enjoyed eating at Ike's, but don't think that this place is the best sandwich joint in town just because it was featured on the Travel Channel like I did; they're awesome, but not without flaws.
You know the place is amazing when you live out of state, fantasize about the sandwiches and schedule your next San Francisco return, partly to visit Ike's Place! Yes, it is that amazingly, deliciously, YuM!We love our San Francisco Giants and our group ordered a Barry Bonds, a Barry Zito and a Timmy Lincecum (my favorite)... Can we say yummy, dripping with goodness beyond words? Each of us was amazed beyond words... Yes, we loved Ike's Place. Yes, we would recommend it. Yes, we are returning this week... And we can't wait!
It's a sandwich people, chill out. There is always a line that's kept me away, but twice now I have gone in the middle of the week when there was nearly no line. I STILL waited 20 minutes for a sandwich. Confusing with so many people running around in there. Maybe I should try the app someone mentioned.
I am a fan of just about everything Ike's is about. Great service, killer food, good location. Truth is I'm not sure what is keeping me from clicking on that 5th star, but my gut instinct was to click on the 4. I'll update my review the next time I go after I figure out exactly why I voted the way I did.
Ike needs to add a place in LA! This joint is the bombdizzle! I've been here twice and my mouth was still watering after finishing my sandwich both times! I don't know if it's because the sandwiches are delicious or because I'm just a fatty like that. Being the carnivore that I am, I got the MATT CAIN: Godfather Sauce, Provolone, Roast Beef, Salami, Turkey. I then added peppers, beer battered onion rings, and fried stuffed jalapenos. Yes, you read that right. All in one sandwich! I don't need to explain..it was just so... damn... good. Amazing! I can't wait for my next trip to the yay-area! Second stop, Ike's Place! (Gotta check into my hotel first). Quick tips: 1. There's street parking in the surrounding area. I think it's free. I know I didn't pay. 2. No seating inside. 3. Get a bag of the voodoo chips! It's got this vinigar/BBQ/pickled flavor to it. Perfect side to the perfect sandwich.
I have been here twice. First time, we dropped by on our way out of SF. We picked 3 sandwiches to order to share:----Menage A Trois: great, given I am always a sucker for Honey Mustard and Swiss. BBQ sauce to me was little on the strong side, as it somewhat mask the other flavors. But it was no biggie.Elvis Keith: it was good too, but wasabi mixed with Terriyaki and Sriracha which my gf and her friend already doused in when I tried the sandwich, tasted a little weird to me. Perhaps I wasn't in the mood for that. But the flavors together gives a perfect kick. The Dutch crunch was great. Matt Cain: A pretty meaty sandwich and it was delicious. And you can't go wrong really with Salami. Their cheese filled Godfather sauce made this sandwich perfect. Like the perfect tasty feeling after pitching a perfect game.Jim Rome: got this the second time I came. Their signature red pesto sauce made this sandwich a "can't miss". ----Prices are a little on the expensive side, but the taste and portion makes up for it. All sandwiches we ordered came with a bag of free chips. Wait time was 30 minutes when we came on a fully packed Saturday afternoon. Wait time was around 15 minutes when I came again on a Friday late noon. Also it has minimal seating. So expect to take the food to go, or eat it standing or loitering outside. Service & attitude was subpar, but for these places, they are a minimal issue. ----One of the best tasting sandwich place in SF. I will definitely come back yet again if I pass through.
This place has one of the best gluten free sandwiches in town! They don't have chairs or any amenities but who cares with such good chow!
Best Sandwiches around. I go w/the 49er or the SF Giant!
LOVE LOVE LOVE this sandwich shop, sometimes long lines on weekends though, but that gives you an indication how good their sandwiches are. Worth waiting in line.
It was such a weird place to my liking. The menu has so many sandwiches available! I was in a bit of a hurry so I simply decided to place the order. There was crunch bread made in Dutch style and some dirty sauce. The Dutch bread was pretty decent and I enjoyed eating it. However, the dirty sauce was even weirder than its name. The taste was different than the normal sauce and I got a sore throat right after tasting it. Anyway, it was a onetime experience and I'm not going back.
Awesome sandwiches! Totally get your money's worth.
Came here to use my free bday coupon and enjoyed the Lincecum sandwich. I called in my order and was told to pick up 20 min later...there was no line when I arrived (it was a early dinner- about 415) and I didn't have to wait. Also kudos for the free bag of chips!Not places to eat inside, plenty of open space to stand so get your sandwich and hang out outside or walk over to the Castro. I've been to the Stanford location before which I had to wait over an hour...this seemed to be a bit faster. I'd return again if in the area but would definitely call in my order ahead! Thanks for the free bday sandwich Ike's!
Best Damn Sandwich I ever had. I hated that they had to shift their business location so much in the early days, they should have made this place a cultural landmark. My absolute fave: Going Home For Thanksgiving. At first u feel like you're biting into thanksgiving dinner, and then you get to the sriracha - great twist that adds that extra kick. You'll have to wait an awful long time in line, and even if you call ahead there's going to be a long time to wait. But it's worth it!
Pros: amazing sandwiches, great variety, can order in and pick up, huge portions, friendly staffCons: location, would be be nice if they had an area to sit and eat
Ike's has ruined sandwiches forever for me, in a good way. The only downside of this bold statement is that I live in Chicago, so acquiring another sandwich in the near future could be quite difficult.That aside, my boyfriend and I trekked out to Castro to get one of these sandwiches on a Sunday afternoon. We arrived a few minutes before noon and we didn't face a wait at all, which surprised me based on all the reviews. We spent about ten minutes narrowing down our selections, and we finally decided on the following:1) Name Of Girl I'm Dating (Avocado, halal chicken, honey mustard, pepper jack on Dutch Crunch Bread): Alrighty, this sandwich is good, but not as mind-blowingly good as many of the reviews lead you to believe. Sure, you get a heaping portion of avocado and chicken, but the chicken needed more flavor on its own in my opinion. This sandwich is definitely a safe pick, and I'd recommend that you branch out a bit and try some of their more unique offerings.2) The Damon Bruce (Beer battered onion rings, provolone, steak sauce, thinly sliced rib eye on Dutch Crunch Bread): This is where the five stars comes into play, hell, I would give this sandwich more than five stars if I could. The flavors just worked perfectly together here and as I was filling up (and quickly devouring the sandwich) all I could think was "I want more!". The steak sauce was fantastic, and probably laced with some sort of addictive substance as I couldn't stop thinking about it for the rest of the day (or the day after). The thinly sliced rib eye was incredible, very tender and packed with flavor. The battered onion ring on the top was a nice touch, but I couldn't really taste it in the midst of all the other flavor explosions going on.The sandwiches took about 10-15 minutes to be prepared and they both came with a bag of chips (Ranch BBQ, anyone?). We trekked over to a nearby park to eat our sandwiches, as there is absolutely no seating for consuming your sandwich at Ike's, and there are signs that indicate that you shouldn't eat them on the sidewalk or the surrounding curbs.The staff was incredibly friendly and offered suggestions. We happened to walk past Ike's about 45 minutes after we received our sandwiches, and there was a line out the door. My recommendation is to get there early to avoid this. I'm hoping that I happen across San Francisco sometime in the near future so that I can partake in another culinary indulgence that Ike's serves up perfectly.
Gotta love the Going Home for Thanksgiving!
The one day I get to stay in San Fran for the first time in my life, it rained like mad and was hella cold. It didn't stop me from trying to look for this place though under the weathers circumstances. Took hella trollies and busses and finally found it. I was really into finding out whether this place was what people were saying it was!And yeah, I can see what the hype was all about. I took a bite and couldn't restrain myself from stopping!The store could use a little cleaning up to do to be honest. I'm not sure if the current interior is suppose to be a particular style or the owner just doesn't give a rats ass anymore LOL. Feels like you got too many young hipsters hanging in there too. Don't even get me started on their bathroom. Anyways! It's a great place to grab your sandwich as to-go and peace out.
I tried this spot because I saw it at the Travel Channel. The sandwiches are huge and delicious. The long line is worth waiting for.
I've been going to Pho for a couple years now and I always get the pho soup with quail eggs. Absolutely amazing! I love the staff, and the soup has always been fresh and soooo good!
Hands down, the most creative and delicious vegan/vegetarian sandwich in the City. A little pricey, but worth every cent. Grab a sandwich and enjoy it at Dolores Park on a sunny day in the City.
the change is one of my favorite sandwichesThe Super Mario or the Super Luigi...NOM NOM NOM
I'm not going to tell you how I felt that day or how I stopped by with my girlfriend.Just go and order a sandwich. I ordered the Krypotonite. ~12 bucks. I liked it a lot. Will come back again as soon as I collect another 12 dollars through my various hustles.
I came here on my last visit to San Francisco and really enjoyed the sandwiches. Seeing as though this was on Triple D, we had to try it and had absolutely no regrets. I ordered the "Bella", boyfriend ordered the "Reuben", and a friend ordered "Matt Cain" (GO Giants!) and we were all satisfied and happy after.It was kind of crowded, but the orders came out quickly.The only bad thing was that there were no tables to sit and eat at :( but it didn't ruin the experience one bit.My friend said other locations have different sandwiches, so might check them out when given the chance.PS: DUTCH CRUNCH BREAD.
It's my second time coming here & I'm glad my boyfriend and I went here because I just had a "Monday kind of Friday" & this place makes Friday, a Friday!We ordered the mnage a trois & [name of the girl you're dating] both on Dutch crunch.They were both delicious and the bread was still considerably crunchy even though we ordered it for to go.. They don't really have tables so you don't have much of a choice unless you want to eat on their window bench but that may be a bit awkward when the place gets packed. Anyway, the sandwiches are large and they come with chips. Worth the price you pay because they're extremely generous with the ingredients inside your sandwich as well. My boyfriend and I ordered two sandwiches and we sliced both of them into three and shared with his mom too! We were all stuffed and satisfied.I love the caramel covered apple lollipops too! Cute and tasty! We are definitely coming back!
i dont know why i keep coming back for these sandwiches. it is the sauce, it has to be the sauce. curse these expensive sandwiches. 3 stars because it makes my wallet weep and i honestly think it is not an out of this world sandwich but i find myself coming back.no place to sit and my sandwich gets soggy in no time which is a downer.my review was all in caps at first i am offended yelp do you not like my yelling.
You have not lived until you've tried the GLUTEN-FREE Matt Cain sandwich at this place. Its the best GF sandwich in a 100 mile radius of SF. Bread is dutch crutch roll style and is made gluten-free in-house.
I should actually have like 4 reviews for this place. This place is awesome! The line sucks! But once you have a sandwich in yo face then it's all good and worth the wait! Anyways, I think my favorite sandwich here is the MILF. hahahahaha! MILF = Toasted Dutch Crunch Bread, Chicken Breast, Hot Sauce, Jalapeo Poppers, and the rest of the fixin's... AWESOME!Anyways, while my boys were in town, I treated them here and they loved it sans the line but it was all good since they didn't pay, right?!The employees here are very nice too, well trained in being a great customer servant! The menu has a huge variety for carnivores and herbivores. YE-AHHHHH!
These were the most delicious sandwiches ever :DStaff is helpful and nice. The place may be crowded during lunch time but it is worth it! Be careful though, because you can not sit there.Prices are OK, since you won't be hungry anymore afterwards (there is also a bag of chips).
HUGEEEE, yammmy sammichesss! If you like spicy food, get this :Hollywood's SF Cheesesteak with mozzarella sticks, jalapeno poppers & extraaaa banana peppers & jalapenos on Dutch Crunch!The total for this add your own to a signature sandwich comes out to $16, but its sooooo worth it! The Hollywood's SF Cheesesteak comes with mushrooms, provolone, and thinly sliced rib eye, and for around $3 each, your adding mozzarella sticks & jalapeno poppers. The combination is amazzzzinggg - cheesy & spicy!I also tired  - Spiffy Tiffy - Get this if you like Pesto!avocado, halal chicken, mushrooms, pepper jack, pesto & provolone If I got this again, I would do without the lettuce.- We're JUST Friendsavocado, halal chicken, pepper jack, sweet orange glazeThe Spiffy Tiffy & We're Just Friends is pretty similar, but the pesto in the Spiffy Tiffy is better than their orange glaze. Chips: The pickle chips are perfect with the sandwiches! Loveee the saltiness & pickle flavor!Call in & pick up your food! There's no where to sit and enjoy your food at Ike's so your going to end up to-going anyways.
Ok so I REALLY don't know why I haven't reviewed this place yet! Ikes is AMAZING! Hands down the BEST sandwiches in San Francisco. Lines are long especially on hot sunny days in the Castro, but totally worth the wait. The sandwiches are made fresh, I love how they name them after City icons such as Matt Cain, Lincecum, Bumgarner, Barry B. and other famous people and so on. My favorite has to be the Matt Cain on Dutch Crunch. Thats my go to order. Prices are a bit expensive for a sandwich. Definitely worth it but its not cheap like Subway (But Subway is nasty). I also tried Lincecum, Barry B, Willie Brown, The Gator (SFSU), Paul Ruben's, and The Backstabber. All of them were EXCELLENT. I love their sauces the Godfather Sauce and Dirty Sauce! (I know I tried a few more just forgot the names) But still my favoirte hands down is the Matt Cain! =)I also love how they have a location at the SFSU campus! Very convenient for SFSU students, and seeing all the food is crap there theirs something worth while to eat. (As you can tell Im way to lazy to post a 2nd review on the SFSU location haha)
Im not sure if I'm happy or sad that there isn't an Ike's Place in the Tri-State area because if there were I'd probably be 500 pounds!We made sure that we hit this spot which was about 2 miles from our hotel for lunch on the last day of our trip (Tuesday) and it was well worth the trip. There wasn't much of a line which was a pleasant surprise considering this place has been on TV. The menu is enormous with just the top 20 or so choices on the chalkboard behind the counter. We got out sandwiches and took them to the park just a few blocks away. I went with The Change (ribeye, smoked gouda, beer battered onion rings and BBQ sauce) and added Mozzarella sticks - when in rome right? It was better than I could have imagined, everything was fresh and went so well together. My girlfriend went with The Matt Cain (turkey, roast beef, salmi, provolone, lettuce, tomato with godfather sauce) - everything was super fresh and she enjoyed it. (pictures attached)Bottom-line, Ike's will be back on the itinerary the next time we are in the bay area!
Although I live in SF, it takes at least 30 minutes for me to get to Ike's whether it be by bus or car and it's TOTALLY WORTH IT! It's hard to think that a sandwich can taste THAT good, but Ike's lives up to all the hype. I highly recommend the dutch crunch bread but really, all of them are delicious! I'm so happy they've opened additional locations all around the bay area!
Delicious sandwiches, and gluten free bread is available as an option which is FANTASTIC.But it's not perfect, sadly. If you want chicken your only choice is halal. There is no non-halal option available (unless you choose another meat). Surprised in a place like SF where people are very aware of things like this they get away with it. Perhaps most people here don't know what halal entails.... maybe they think it's a good thing, like "organic".
Great sandwiches. Vegan options. Always friendly faces. Not 5 stars because long waits, and a little pricey.Not for everyday but when you want a tasty lunch this is a great place.
Ike's is awesome because they get mariposa gluten free sandwich rolls and also make it possible for us to get a deli sandwich! I guess that's why the gluten free sandwich is pretty small compared to most deli sandwiches. I don't know how big the regular sandwiches are but I do feel that the sandwiches are over priced. I will sometimes pay for the convince of the gluten free but still. The sandwiches are tasty but sloppy and always get on my clothes. I really do like the taste just wish it was bigger. Sometimes the less popular places are the gems though. They are creative and hard workers at Ike's however and they are nice caring people about your allergies!
I've mostly been coming to this location because I'm working in the city this summer, but the Menage a Trois is just as amazing as at the Oakland location where I originally had it! I'll describe it again just because I'm in so in love with this sandwich. The halal chicken is juicy and tender, soaking up all the BBQ sauce and real honey. The lettuce and tomato add a brightness to the sandwich, while the Dutch Crunch is honestly just the perfect way to tie the entire sandwich together. For that extra spice, add jalapenos and banana peppers! I always love a little spiciness to my sandwich. Ike's is unbeatable, and I savor every single bite.
THE BEST SANDWHICH place in SAN FRAN! I found this place looking for sandwhiches on yelp and ended up finding an all time favorite sandwhich shop!
After a couple times visiting San Francisco I finally went here and was pretty happy with it. The staff were really great about making recommendations and helping us out with the best vegan choices. If you want a sandwich smothered in sauce this is definitely the place to go and it really hit the spot after biking around the city for hours.It's not really a place you eat at; most people just grab their food and go somewhere else - Dolores Park is fairly close so you might as well go there to enjoy it.
I love the location in SF! Ike's is the perfect meal for a random date adventure. Wait in line, order a sandwich, then eat at Dolores Park a couple blocks away. $10 for a hearty sandwich (comes with complimentary chips and sour apple/caramel lollipop). I ordered the Phili cheese sandwich. Ate half and I was so full already that I needed to save the other half for the next day. Good thing the leftovers tasted just as great as the first bite!
I've been working in the Castro for more than half a year and only a few weeks ago did I discover that Ike's was just around the corner!! I've had Ike's before in the South Bay, so I was ecstatic to find them here!!I love it so much that I've downloaded the app so I can order from my phone. Good luck getting a sandwich by walking in and waiting...I love the Mnage a Trois, the Name of the Girl I'm Dating and the Spiffy Tiffy. I also love that there are gluten-free options. So relieved for that!I wish there were space to eat inside but I usually just bring it back to the office and make a mess all over my desk. Order with the app or call in!
Oh boy.... I drank the cool kool-aid and I liked it! I had heard about Ike's Place for a long time. I had heard two things about it 1) it's ABSOLUTELY AMAZING and 2) The lines are RIDICULOUS. I'm proud the say... everything I heard about Ike's is absolutely true.I walked up to Ike's with two of my cousins and saw a line going about 20 feet out the front door and along the sidewalk. We line up...wait....chat...wait some more. All in all it was a good 40 mins before we make our way inside and put our orders in. Fast-forward another 40 minutes... and only 1 of our 3 sandwiches has come out and I found out... to my rumbling stomach's horror... that the other 2 sandwiches were "lost" and that they'd rush them out. Another 10 mins or so and we finally get our sandwiches... the guy who delivered them out apologized profusely and offered us sodas on the house... a nice token but at that point I was really annoyed.... that was until I took the first bite out of my sandwich. WOW!!!!THE ORDERChange - 6 out of 5 - Wow! Kinda blew my mind. The sandwich has thinly sliced rib eye, BBQ, beer battered onion rings, cheddar and their oh so yummy dirty sauce.  the rib eye was so tender and juicy. All the fixings of the sandwich were perfect. The Dirty sauce is downright magical. The biggest surprise, though, was the bread.... which was amazing. It was so fresh. The exterior had a nice light crunch but was still super soft and airy. Super Luigi - 5 out of 5 - All beef meatballs, stuffed jalapeno poppers, marinara sauce. All kinds of win! The meatballs were juicy and tender. The marinara sauce was perfect. It had a nice tang but didn't overpower the meatballs. The jalapeno poppers were a great touch. They added a nice crunch and gooey cheesiness. Great sandwich.  Name of the Girl I'm Dating - 3.5 out of 5 - Halal Chicken, honey mustard, avocado, pepperjack. This was a very solid sandwich and well done... but not in the same league as the other two. The chicken was tender and the honey mustard was nice but my mind wasn't blown.OVERALLWow I do want to go back but god I'm not looking forward to the lines. Next time I plan to order over the phone!!!
Don't be overwhelmed by the long lines or bustling atmosphere... call in your order ahead of time and walk out of the shop with a smug smile on your face and a coveted sandwich in your hand past all the desperate looking folks waiting for their food!Overwhelming menu means I'll probably never be able to try all of the sandwhiches since they're $10+ (including a $20 sammie). Eat your sandwich as soon as possible since all of the sauces/ingredients soak the bread. I personally hate limp, shredded lettuce and will ask them to omit this in the future.
Ike's is a small place to pick up subs - it's not a sit-down place. They have creative and tasty food - best name goes to the sandwich called "[My current girlfriend's name]".  Bonus points for an avocado-heavy menu. There are two kinds of root beer, so, winning.The bread is great and I felt like I had accomplished one of my San Francisco tourist goals when I had their SF sourdough.Ike's is on the very edge of a nice neighbourhood but it butts right up to a sketchy one, so there's that.
I have never had a bad sandwich here. I can easily recommend all of them...okay, maybe not the $20 ones, that seems a little steep for a sandwich. This location is so much better than the Stanford one in terms of shorter lines and faster service, although there are not really any tables for you to eat at. Most people just plant themselves on the chairs along the walls while waiting for their orders or chowing down on their sandwiches. This is fine with me, as I do not expect to be wined and dined when I am in a sandwich mood.Ike himself is spotted frequently at this location too!One tip: Please be respectful of the traffic you bring to this quiet neighborhood. I heard a lot of neighbors grumbling about the noise and cars illegally parked in front of their garages. I would be too...even if the sandwiches are worth a stinkin' SF parking ticket.
Ike's is perfect. Delicious sandwiches smothered in their dirty sauce. Dutch crunch bread is a must. And look at all the other reviews -- how can this many people be wrong?My go-to is the Nacho Girl. But everything I've tried here is great. You really can't go wrong. Even their chips are awesome. I love the Zapp's Voodoo flavor.Definitely phone ahead -- you get to bypass what is almost always a long ass line. Turns what could be an annoying wait into a fairly convenient process.Only wish they had a bigger space to sit and eat. Or (on days where I'm especially lazy) deliver...Enjoy!
I absolutely ADORE this place. OMG, the secret sauce they use on their sandwiches is to DIE FOR. I've been going to Ike's off and on (I was in LA for a while = no Ike's) since 2008, and it's my absolute favorite sandwich place. They are legendary for a reason. Just writing this review is making my mouth water...What else to say? You should certainly check it out if you're looking for some good eats in that neighborhood, and if you like sandwiches, then you HAVE to check it out.
One word:yum. I can honestly say I never really appreciated sandwiches until I tried this place. I had the name the girl you're dating sandwich, and my boyfriend had the Matt Cain sandwich. Both were absolutely delicious. The Dutch crunch bread was perfectly cooked. Be prepared for long lines...I came at 3pm on a Sunday and waited for an hour... But I guarantee you will not be complaining after the first bite. Sandwiches come with a bag of chips and a caramel apple pop, which is a nice perk. I strongly suggest the voodoo chips! Will definitely be back. :)
My mouth is watering as I'm thinking about Ike's...and my tummy just growled. Let's just keep this short & sweet:EVERYTHING IS SO TASTY! I got "We're Just Friends", which consisted of halal chicken, orange sauce, avocados, pepperjack, and all the fixings - shredded lettuce, tomatoes, banana peppers, pickles, onions, and of course, their famous "dirty sauce." With all this, on a dutch crunch, I must say, we're definitely not just friends...WE'RE LOVERS, LOVE AT FIRST BITE. The orange glaze was very light, and sweet and tangy. The avocados were just the right amount, and were riped and justly smushed. The fixings were extremely fresh, and I loved how the banana peppers gave it that extra crunch. The dutch crunch crunch roll was NOT soggy with all these ingredients. They also give you a free bag of dirty potato chips! Jalapeno is definitely the best kind , yummm!Tips:-Come on a weekday for lunch to avoid the line.-There's only two benches inside...but no worries, Dolores Park is right there for a picnic outside!
Still tasty, but overall I think too expensive for what it is since I need at least two sandwiches to fill me up, and I'm a smaller chick. Their gluten free bread may be too small for some of the sandwiches--last time I got it pretty much all of the avocado part was smeared outside of the sandwich itself. Props for being amusing as it held on for dear life. No props for the bread being super mushy.Lines for even picking up take way too long, which may contribute to bread mushiness.They don't seem very good at personalizing orders. They always include the chips and lollipop even though I ask them not to--but god forbid they actually give me the pickles on the side like I want (at least I get no pickles...?).Oh well.
Tasty tasty sandwich
2 words: Dutch Crunch!I've been to SF a couple of times and it's always a must to grab a bite at Ike's. Always good! And you get chips with your order. Voodoo flavor! (:
Awesome sandwiches, HUGE variety, and fairly fast. A must try if you're in the area. I recommend checking out the menu before going in since there are so many options to expedite the process.
HALAL Love that they have halal meat. I have a lot of friends that eat halal meat so this is a great place to take them for yummy subs!!!!!MENAGE A TROISHalal chicken, honey, bbq sauce, honey mustard, swiss cheddar and pepper jack cheese. Love the honey sauce that is in is sandwich. Makes it juicy and delicious. I would get this sub again. #125We asked for a sandwich with turkey, bacon, avocado. He told us it was called this and we got it. This sub is not as good as the menage a trois. DUTCH CRUNCHThis bread is the best. Crunchy and flavorful. Makes a difference in the sammich! SITTING No sitting except for one or two benches against the wall. SERVICEAmazing. Everyone here is super nice and they are quite fast with your order.
Absolutely amazing... Order anything, and you will not be disappointed. Literally. For the price of $10-$13, you get a candy. a sandwich, and a bag of chips. The sandwich comes in a hefty portion; I had to share with my friend (maybe because my stomach is the size of a tennis ball). To be honest, I forgot what I ordered here, but it doesn't matter. The sandwich I ate was delicious, and I'm sure Ike's other sandwiches won't let me down.
Perfect. Best place to eat in San Francisco. Order ahead for those sunny days at Dolores though!
While laying on bed, chatting it up with a friend, I was told: go visit Ike's! And some cupcake shop, which I of course, forgot about, or something. "Get the spiffy tiffy!", she said, adding that the 'menage a trois' was supposedly the best. And, wow. Andrew, my wonderful host, took me to Ike's and showed me one of the great culinary wonders of San Francisco - it's simple! Arrive at Sanchez&16th. Park (in SF...?). Stand in line. Order. Profit.I don't know what's up with the lollipop they give you (meh), but the sandwich is freakin' good. The kryptonite in particular is ridiculous (huge, and wrapped as two sandwiches), and my spiffy tiffy...wow. Halal Chicken, Mushrooms, Avocado, Pesto, Provolone, Pepper Jack, who'd ever have thought you could combine so fabulously? The sandwiches have flavor, moisture, texture, and enough freshness to smile you happy - and taste perfectly fine even a day later, making that huge kryptonite not such a bad idea, after all.I'd love to come back and run through their menu, which by the way, is just a blast to read. But then, as I live far, far away, and the sandwiches are I think ten bucks each, my trips here won't be as frequent as one hopes.
BEST. SAUCES. EVER.The sauces are so good on theses sandwiches. I love this place. But be warned-- it is very messy!
Best sandwich I have ever had, hands down. Get the Matt Cain. It'll change your life, no joke. I live in Los Angeles and was in SF on a little vacation and this sammich blew all the ones in LA out of the water, by a long shot.Get your sammich and go to Dolores Park and enjoy all the awesome people and the incredible view of San Fran.
AWESOMELY FANTASTIC sandwiches, but looongg waits; depending on the time of the day, might get even loooooooonger.//
Best sandwich I may have ever eaten!!!Menage a trois. I scarfed down that thing so fast, and I wasn't super hungry. And yes, i did totally regret that afterwards because I wanted to eat another one and all I could do was drool over a picture I took earlier of it. I can't wait to try the other sandwiches.Sandwich is a bit pricy... especially since I don't like chips that much and it comes with chips..
Best sandwiches in America.
wow. just wow. no question that this is the best sandwich place in town. I was visiting friends from out of town and they insisted on taking me here. have only heard the best from them and now i know why!!! i got the vegetarian sandwich with a bag of chips. Even took one to go for my plane ride home. Will definitely come back next time i am in town visiting
Their portions are huge... So thank you for that!  I also don't love waiting in lines so I always get two when I go. Any of their classic menu items are always a good bet. Just go for a sandwich that has what you like in it, and their flavor combinations will astound you. I can't think of a better sandwich shop in the city. Well, not one closer to me at least.  Oh, and as for the portion thing, you can easily be full if you share. I gave this four stars because of the line... I really don't like waiting forever... then again, you can always order online!
Came in here with the expectation of bomb sandwiches, left with soiled panties-- in the best of way.I've heard the horror stories of the super long line but when I got there, there was only one other person ahead of me. Came on a weekday at 11AM and I pretty much went straight to the one cashier although there were a plethora of calls coming in that would interrupt my order and the person in front of me. Decided to order the reuben on DUTCH CRUNCH with everything (you have to ask for the banana peppers and such). You also get a bag of chips (salt and vinegar, please!) Met up with the GF and split the sandwich with her on her lunch break.I only regret that I have but one-half sandwich to give.
I got the Menage A Trois on Dutch Crunch and it was delicious. Despite the long wait, it was definitely worth it. If you like sandwiches, this is a place to visit. Next time, since now I know that you can phone orders ahead, I am going to do that instead. I'm coming back to try the other sandwiches. And the dirty sauce is ON POINT.
I wanted to give 3.5 stars, but since thats not possible, I had to round down. This was our first stop on our short trip to SF, we drove straight here from LA. Luckily found parking right in front and went in and ordered our sandwiches. Matt cain + dutch crunch and a Damon bruce + dutch crunch.We wait and we wait and we wait and we wait.. and as I watch people who came at least 10-15 minutes after us get their sandwich, I realize that we've been there almost an hour... and it wasn't that busy...So I ask a guy and he tells us that he called our name and some guy took our sandwiches about 20 minutes ago... Interesting, seeing as how we still had our receipt with the name on it. Anyways, the guy said he would get us new sandwiches made on priority but that still took an extra 10-15 minutes.Anyways, we get to our hotel room and tear into the sandwiches... good thing they were DELICIOUS, otherwise I would've been pretty pissed.The godfather sauce is awesome! and the GF loved the damon bruce although I definitely preferred my matt cain. Good food, slightly pricey for a sandwich, but minus 2 stars for starting off our SF trip on a bad note.
OH HOLY CRAP SANDWICH OF MY DREAMS. You are thinking- this is over the top. Ike's is good but it's not THAT good. But, if you are vegetarian- it is. Maybe not all will agree. But, it is hard to find a tasty sando is this city that is not covered in meat. So yeah, tasty. And, I like all of the options. Thank you, Ike.
If you want chicken, go for the Mnage  Trois or the Spiffy Tiffy, which are basically the same thing but if you love avocado, the latter is like a thousand times better. But regardless of what kind of sandwich you get, you must get it on the dutch crunch. Oh and not to mention, the New Orleans kettle style Zapp's chips and caramel apple pops included in your order are like, out of this world, quite literally because I've never seen them anywhere else before?! So step inside Ike's and you've taken a step into another realm of phenomenal sandwiches and other ethereal wonderful things.
How can a sandwich be so good?!?!? Found Ike's Place today after realizing that the restaurant we wanted to go to was closed on Mondays. Checked yelp to find something inexpensive and close to where we were and Ike's sounded perfect. I had the Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian on Dutch crunch and my friend had the Matt Cain. Wow! Best sandwiches ever!!! So happy to have found Ike's and I will definitely be back.
Sandwiches are really good! Only been to the SF location but I was very happy with the meal.
This place is legit. When you read the names and ingredients in the sandwiches, they sound really strange and potentially gross. But when you take a bit, somehow it becomes a symphony in your mouth. Beware, the sandwiches are quite big and wholesome.
Use the iPhone App, beat the lines, same deliciousness.
The best sandwich place in the city. All the sandwiches I've had were excellent.  Well worth the wait.  The Nacho Boy, nuff said!
With over 4000 reviews, this place doesnt really need my help, but I will write a quick one anyway. Got the Pastrami-Charmed Life on Dutch Crunch bread (pastrami, homemade poppy seed coleslaw, honey mustard, pepper jack) with the addition of lettuce, and red onions.I thought it might be a little odd having honey mustard with pastrami, but I was wrong! It was BOMB!!The sandwiches are BIG. Definitely a meal for 2. I ate 1/2 at lunch and the other 1/2 at dinner. Probably one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. People familiar with Jackson Market in Culver City, Ike's gives them a run for their money. GO HERE!
Ike's is one of my favorite sandwich spots in the Bay Area. They have such a wide selection of sandwiches that I have yet to try them all. So far the Matt Cain is my favorite.
The original store is still the best! We came here because we heard it offered halal food and were surprised to find the line extending well into the street. You have to request halal meat, but it's available. It's a tiny shop, but they have anything but tiny selections! The most delicious halal sandwiches I've ever had in my life! I've been to their other two locations at Stanford University and in Cupertino, and they're just not as good as the original, though it's much of the same menu.
I'm kind of shocked I've never written a review for Ike's. For days when you don't feel like counting calories and want a hardy, delicious sandwich, this is the place. I still remember the old location when, even then, the sandwich was good enough to justify standing in line for an hour to get one. These days, the operation on 16th St is a lot more efficient and the lines not so long, but the sandwiches are just as good.I usually go for the "Name of Girl I'm Dating..." or the "Ex-Girlfriend," which is just the former with bacon on it. Ike's is actually such a cornerstone of my San Francisco experience since moving here in 2009, that I used one as part of a hidden urban picnic proposal where I asked them to write "Name of Girl I'm Marrying..." on the sandwich I gave to my now-wife.Anyway, this place is great. The menu is broad and interesting. The Dirty Sauce is delicious. I highly suggest grabbing a sandwich and eating it at Dolores Park on a nice day. There isn't seating in the store but the sandwiches are best when eaten warm, so have a plan!
So i've been wanting to try Ike's for FOREVER. And I finally did on a hot day. I was scared the line was gonna be s00per long but it wasn't unbearable. Probably about 15-20 minute wait, which I didn't mind. There was an employee doing trivia outside and giving away lollipops, skipping to first in line, or free t-shirt which was pretty awesome.Cashiers: efficient and friendlyYour order comes with a free bag of chips (KOO!) you get like 4 choices and it's all kettle chips (oo fancy)Sammich: the price wasn't too ridic considering all the hype, size, and that it comes with a free bag of chips, but to me, it was just. decent. It was REALLY messy to eat which is a big downer for me. But to be honest, the bread was pret-ty damn good. I'm a big bread lover soooooooo yeah.The sandwich itself was just OKAY to me, but it IS really big. I ate half and got pretty full (or maybe I just ate too fast like I usually do)I got "Name of the girl I'm dating" or something, which came with halal chicken (I didn't taste the HALAL part of it, avocado (CAME WITH LOTS), and lots of sauce which made it messy and soggy fast.EH! I'm glad to say I've tried this place but this is really not that special.
Recap: Had the Lex Luther, line was fairly long. Waited about 40 mins. Seating is limited. Staff is friendlyVerdict: Over 5000 reviews, 4.5 stars. It's good, its really that good. The sandwiches are HUGEEEE! I split the Lex Luthor and it still filled me up. Everything on the sandwich is delicious, and it sounds like all the ingredients wouldnt mesh together, but somehow they all do. Each sandwich has it's own unique twist, which is a huge incentive to go back and try everything else on the menu.4 starts instead of 5 because of the long lines, and high prices. $20 for the some of the sandwiches, $12 for others, is pretty high. But in the end, I wasn't complaining because it was delicious.
Everyone can make a sandwich, but the culinary magicians at Ike's have perfected what it means to craft a sandwich. The lengthy menu of salivating choices and the possibility to add, subtract, or creatively enhance your meal will leave you oogling before the register. Luckily the employed sandwichanistas have studied their art and can help you compile the meal you deserve and not the one you need. My personal favorites are "The name of the girl I'm dating" and the Kelly Kapowski. Be sure to make it "extra-dirty" if you are feeling like using multiple napkins!
Now that Ike's has expanded throughout the Bay Area, I mostly frequent the Oakland and Stanford locations. Nevertheless, I will always remember the first time I tried Ike's in The Castro.It was Tuesday, August 24, 2010 and I was hanging out with friends by The Castro. Since I was the only one among us who had not been to Ike's, they suggested that we stop by and grab some sandwiches. When we arrived at Ike's, the line reached past the end of the block. We assumed it would move quickly -- after all, why would anyone in their right mind wait more than an hour for a sandwich? Alas, this was not the case. We were not aware that Ike's had just been handed an eviction notice and that the place was slated to close for good at the end of the day. Fans from all around the area had flooded to the sandwich shop to say goodbye. As we were waiting in line, camera crews arrived on scene, and we finally realized why there was such a circus outside, even by Ike's standards.Not daunted, we waited. And waited. And waited. 30 minutes in we almost gave up. An hour in we began questioning our sanity, but we stayed rooted in line for fear of having wasted an hour for nothing. It wasn't until more than 2 hours later that we finally reached the register. I ordered a salmon sandwich, which came with Ike's infamous dirty sauce. Hungry, I was dying to get my hands around the sandwich. Unfortunately, the kitchen was backlogged, so we were asked to wait outside.So we waited again. Nearly 45 minutes later our orders were finally ready. Famished, I violently ripped the wrapping paper off my sandwich only to discover that they'd given me the wrong order! We were a block away by then, but returned since there was no way I was eating a sandwich with pickles (which I had not asked for). The lady at the register was apologetic enough and told us they'd do their best to fix my order as quickly as they could.And so we waited again. Nearly 20 minutes later, I was finally handed my order. I was once and for all the proud recipient of an Ike's creation, which I immediately dove into. The bread was wonderfully baked and the dirty sauce brimming with flavor. It was one of the best sandwiches I'd ever had, although anything might have tasted good then considering how hungry I was.Overall, Ike's delivers one of the best sandwiches in the country. Now that it has expanded, the line isn't too bad, so I don't mind going. But I doubt I'd ever want to go through the ordeal that was my first encounter with Ike's all over again. As memorable as it was.RECAPTime spent waiting for sandwich: 3+ hoursTime spent eating sandwich: 5 minutes
You guys don't even want to know how stoked that there's going to be an Ike's in Walnut Creek. I've only been there a few times, but it's my favorite sandwich shop, hands down.The voodoo chips are delicious - you can find them at the Winco in Brentwood, CA. Not sure about other Winco's, but when I saw them, I spazzed out a little in the aisle. I bought two bags and my husband's friends ate them all at a little get-together we hosted... And we had 6 other kinds of chips! Voodoo chips yummmmmm.The sandwiches are even better, though. My favorite is the Matt Cain, so far. Simple but scrumptious. My husband loves the Nacho Boy. The roast beef on that sandwich is unreal. It tastes more like steak. Augh. It's so good it's killing me right now talking about it.There are some sandwiches with price tags of $20, and that sounds like a freakish amount for a sandwich, but those purchases are for such a HUGE amount. My hubby and I took a friend there a couple of weeks back and we decided to split a Kryptonite - it was basically like 4 sandwiches in one. We could've split that between four people with a side of chips each and been perfectly fine for the night. Our friend was very impressed with the amount to cost ratio.Protip: Follow Ike's on FB if you happen to live close by. He gives out a lot of secret recipes and codes for BOGO or whatever sale he's doing that day. He also gives out random Warriors tickets and things when he can't go. He's actually been at the store every time I've gone! I wish I'd have said hi but I get a little shy. No idea why! He seems like a sweet guy.
These sandwiches are good, but SO HUGE.
The sandwiches are only okay.They're very overpriced, i'd say cut the price in half and you've got a closer approximation of the value of the food.My $15 sandwich left me still hungry, that's a problem for me.For a sandwich of that price, i kind of expect it to fill me up, more than once and i also think that i shouldn't be able to wrap my hands around it easily.Sandwiches being $15 and $20 is also a problem for me.It's a sandwich, not a lap dance.
Only downside to Ike's: too many sandwiches to choose from.
Loved the service, but too pricey for me! Also their veggie sandwiches are good but a little too much sauce.A great place for lunch, experiencing SF and if you don't have a particularly sensitive stomach! :)
On my trip to San Fran , I was ordered (yes ordered) to visit Ike's. After I came back home I kissed and massaged the feet of my buddy who suggested this Sandwich utopia. Thank goodness I went , this is the best sandwich I have indulged in. I savored every bite and almost orgasmed in the restaurant at the flavors. As I entered the restaurant I saw the sandwich menu and chuckled at the sandwich names... they ranged from "Hot Momma Huda (Ike's mom) to the "menage a trios". To our halal friends you can visit as well as Ike uses halal chicken... but I believe only the chicken is halal... but there is always the veggie options is all else fails. Staff is super friendly... I accidentally stumbled into the kitchen and was greeted with welcomes rather than cleavers thrown at my head ...lol Get the TIFFY, Get the DUTCH CRUNCHGet the NAME OF THE GIRL I AM DATINGGet EVERYTHING DAMNIT....GET YOUR BUTTS IN THERE NOW!!!!!!Why are you still reading this review go get yuuuurrrr sammmicchhhhhh!!!!!!sandwiches come with a bag of "dirty" chips and a lollypop. FYI sometimes when it gets crowded they check receipts as their have been sandwich thefts... I see why... their sandwiches are friggin amazing...Thank you Ike !!!! Will tell tales of your endeavors .
This place is good, but not that good. Go to Lucca's in South City or Roxie's. The portions here are minuscule compared to those other two sandwich shops and it wasn't as tasty. There's no where to sit down either so you better have plans to eat somewhere else!
A friend of mines lives in San Francisco and said to me "Hey, I really have to take you to this sandwich shop & oh, it was also featured on the Travel Channel" I said, well lets go!We get to Ike's place and there was a line from the inside of the door to down the street, I said "is this normal?" Apparently, it is. My friend and I ordered the Pilgrim Sandwich - it was so flavorful, the best thing in my mouth that day (literally) who would of though that Cranberries and sircha sauce would go well with each other in a sandwich cause I didn't. It was delicious!Next time I'm in town I will definitely be here grabbing a sandwich for lunch.
I was a first timer at Ike's. I ordered the cheese steak. The wait for the food took quite a while, 10-15 minutes.As for the sandwich itself, it was GOOD. And had quite a fattening feel in my mouth. But after about half the sandwich, the fat/oil was a bit overwhelming and the sandwich no longer tasted as good.The sandwiches here aren't cheap either; averaging about $10 per.
I had a sandwich here after waiting a while and I can't complain. It was messy but that's the way it goes. Maybe I should have been paying attention more to enjoy the place the way most do.
Best sandwiches I've ever put in my mouth, and extremely vegan friendly. There is literally nothing left to say and nothing more I could ask for.
Tasty food, really friendly folks. I've enjoyed the many sandwiches I've gotten here.Thing is, for less $$ without imposing on quality or variety, I'm better off heading over to nearby Rosenberg on Noe ($4 = 1/2 sandwich + chips + drink or $6 = whole sandwich. I've split one order of the half-sandwich and been completely satisfied) or Courtney's Produce with similar deals.
Came here for lunch on Sunday. Waited less than 20 minutes in line. Love the fact that Ike is very considerate and make sure that the line is not blocking the entrance to the restaurant next door. Love the choices.
4600 great yelp reviews can't be wrong. I just had the best sandwich of my life at Ike's Place and am already craving another. Their menu online is HUGE and don't be deceived when you walk in and they only have a few sandwiches listed because you can order anything that is on their menu online. I ordered the Tom Brady which consisted of vegan breaded chicken, garlic & herb sauce, avocado, grilled mushrooms, cheddar cheese and lots and lots of love on the dutch crunch bread. There was no seating indoors so I attempted to find a place to eat on my walk and had to walk up some excruciatingly intense hills until I found the perfect place to sit down and enjoy the best sandwich of my life.I felt no disappointment until the pleasure in my mouth had ended and my hands and face were covered with the heavenly remains of Tom Brady. Be prepared to get messy and need more napkins than you were given. I had to walk forever before I could find a place to wash my hands.I hadn't expected my lunch at Ike's to cost $16 for a sandwich (which comes with a bag of chips) and a Leninade, but it did, and I'm still glad I spent the money because it was well worth it. Next time I'm in San Francisco, Ike's will be the first place I eat.
Ike's is the bee's knees.
Definitely the only sandwich place I will ever wait in line out the door for, only to wait 20 more minutes after ordering. These sandwiches are amazing!!!, my favorite being the Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian. The staff is so friendly, and they make the best recommendations on not only the sandwiches, but also the drinks and chips. I will always be at Ike's on a sunny day, followed by a picnic in Dolores park!
the sandwiches here are delicious. on the way to a museum, the family decided to stop by for lunch and initially i was debating whether the long line would be worth it. luckily, the crowd seemed to dissipate soon enough, and i'm glad to say that the wait was definitely worth it.i ordered the menage a trois. what a delectable blend of flavors: you get the crunch, the tang, the sweet, the creaminess, the meat, the hot, the cold, the spicy kick.. everything!will definitely come back for another 3-way (sandwich) soon ;).
Ike's Places is the best place for an excellent sandwich. Cheese steak of San Francisco, was Good!! I'm coming back to try a different sandwich. The only thing about Ike's is the wait is long, and I drove around the block 3 times, and finally found a park!
Best sammiches, ever.
I love Ike's!!Their menu is extensive and their service is quick. I love that they have vegetarian and vegan options and I am ALWAYS happy with my sandwiches. Bomb.
Really good sandwiches but the lines are crazy every time I've been here. pretty hipster crowd n vibe
Holy Moly! Best sandwich ever! The bread is amazing and the sauce is great. One of a kind the #18 Matt Cain.
Turkey avocado sandwich was ok. nothing special (at all).the dutch crunch was definitely the best I've ever had. I'll be back just for that. I've been wanting to come here for years, but what I really didn't like was that they didn't have their menu out anywhere! It's only online?! WTF. so they've got hundreds of sandwiches but when u go there u can only pick between like 10 sandwiches? thats dumb.
BEST sandwich EVER. BEST MEAL this whole trip!! MUST TRY IT!! Highly recommended![[ Matt Cain ]]-- The bf went straight to this because it's got the "Godfather sauce" which is a dijon with a garlic taste. Something about this made EVERYTHING in life better!! You have to order it if it's your first Ike's sandwich!! Don't forget to put it on Dutch Crunch! This bread has a flaky top and was JUST the right touch!Next on the list to try is their other popular item Menage a Trios. :)//// STARS Overall ////  5 for taste! YUMMY in mahh tummy!! It was such a WONDERFUL sandwich! hah! With every order you get a bag of chips from New Orleans. Lol. But don't plan on sitting there because it's a grab-n-go! Hit up a park like we did and enjoy your sandwich with mother nature. ENJOY!
YUM! Next time I'm gonna ask for extra DIRTY sauce. For those familiar with Roxie in the Sac area - this is my substitute for some sandwich love, while frequenting the bay area. Very tasty. Very friendly staff. There are also quite a few Vegan/Veggie options for the folks depriving themselves of the wonders of the food chain. While you will still find a line here, after the sun sets, I'd say it's still worth the little wait... and lack of seating. But, if you're hawk like me... you can probably prey on a table and score by the time your order is ready. While you can get just about any sandwich featured in a Dagwood Bumstead or Homer Simpson wet dream... including jalapeno poppers and the kitchen sink, between two pieces of bread, I thoroughly enjoyed the regular ol' pastrami and bacon... with a side of Blow Pop.
This place is definitely hyped up for NO REASON. I got the Spiffy Tiffy and my friend ordered the Sometimes I'm Vegetarian with Dutch Crunch bread. We both thought that their sandwiches were just alright, not even that great at all. They tasted like mayo and more mayo with some lettuce. Also, their wiches are SO expensive! I could enjoy a real meal with $11. Last point: There's NO SEATING at all. What's with that? It's a huge sandwich that can't and shouldn't be eaten standing up. Come on Ike, give us a chair.
These sandwiches are delicious! Too many reviews that I shouldn't even try to really find anything that hasn't been said and say it because it's probably all been said. Try the voodoo chips though! They're great. I wish they delivered 6 hours south.
Went here again today and it was just as good as I remember it. I got The Linncecum for $11 with dutch crunch bread. It had turkey, ham, avocado, cheese with their dirty sauce. I don't know what they put in this dirty sauce but it is SO good. They usually don't add onions, pickles, jalapenos, and peppers for free unless you ask for it. This sandwich came with a bag of dirty chips. It is HUGE too, so full after eating just half my sandwich but I had to finish the whole thing cause it's that good. My boyfriend got The Kryptonite and that sandwich literally has everything in it. It not only has almost every kind of lunch meat with pesto but also jalapeno poppers and onion rings. I don't know if they messed up our order or not but they gave us 2 of these sandwiches. We paid $20 for this sandwich and for 2 of them it was totally worth it. The place doesn't have tables or anything to eat at so most people just take it to go. But there is one bench and a copule chairs in there where we ate our sandwiches at today. Must come place to try the best sandwich OF YOUR LIFE.
Best sandwich shop in SF. They have a bunch of sandwiches named after Giants' pitchers and if you order that sandwich on the day that pitcher is pitching, you get a free soda! And I have unintentionally been the beneficiary of this sweet deal numerous times! Free Ike's brand Cinnamon Toast Soda? No complaints here :)
Life is good when you eat a great sandwich....
I have seen the light - from Ike's bright sandwichy-world. I am in love with this place. Yes - no parking. Yes - a long line. But they have it goin on. They have plenty of staff to get you through the line fast. We got there at 6:55, 5 minutes before they closed on a Sat night and they took every last customer in line, even past the closing time. Oh... And the food! I had to try the Kryptonite well.... just because. It had so many things in it and was so huge. They give you this sandwich in a heavier bag and in a part 1 and part 2. Hubby and I shared part 1 to enjoy part 2 the next day. It was so worth the $20 price tag. So many flavors all complimenting each other including roast beef, bacon, ham, cheese, mozzarella sticks, avocados, stuffed jalapeos, onion rings, pastrami, pesto, salami and turkey. Hubby ordered the Elvis Keith with halal chicken, swiss, teriyaki and wasabi mayo which he said rocked his world. They shave their meat fresh which makes a ton of difference on sandwiches. Yes, get the crunch bread always. I am goin back everytime I go to SF. Rock on sandwich king.
Love this place.Every time I am in the Bay Area I try to com here for a quick sandwich. The only issue is that this place is so popular you literally need to plan your day around coming here. I always go with the Menage a Trois on a dutch crunch roll. It has a couple different cheese with honey and a BBQ pulled chicken. I can't find the bread they use here anywhere in New England.
Delicious sandwiches!! Anything on Dutch Crunch rolls. I like Matt Cain, Madison Bumgardner & Spiffy Tiffy!! Yummmm
SOMETIMES I'M A VEGETARIAN. Get it. Got it? GOOD. Oh, and you're welcome. Please note that none of these sandwiches are remotely healthy when doused in dirty sauce. Nonetheless, they make my mouth water. The food is very fresh, especially the bread! Hate the wait? Order online, pick it up, and leave the property.
GAH! What can I say? This is an absolute must in SF. I came here about 3 years ago and had the Super Mario. I was in SF this past weekend and I didn't think we would be in the area so I was prepared to skip it this time around. Fortunately, my friends heard about it from other people and after realizing it's not too far from Bi-Rite, a visit became mandatory! Coming during the peak lunch time meant we had to wait about 45 minutes. I'm not usually one to wait that long for a sandwich, but hey, it was a special occasion! I ordered the Heath Ledger and added mozzarella sticks. I didn't realize that they were vegan meatballs until I had already ordered it, but I think I got it confused with another sandwich, but I didn't mind! Loved my sandwich overall! Too much ranch and not enough red pesto (quite messy!), but my love of the dutch crunch outweighed that. I ate my whole sandwich--so full that I didn't even eat dinner! $20 was a lot to drop for a sandwich, chips & drink. But if it's a special occasion I say go for it!
I don't get it. Delivery takes forever, and all three sandwiches that I have ordered from here are gross. Blech!Far too many choices. Yet they all seem to taste the same.
Almost 1300 reviews?! Daaaaaym. I'll keep mine nice and short. Awesome staff! Super friendly and helpful!First time here, going for the gold. Ordered the Kryptonite. *insert drumroll* Roast beef, corned beef, pastrami, salami, turkey, bacon, ham, mozzarella sticks, stuffed jalapeno poppers, onion rings, avocado (was not available), lettuce, tomato, pickles and banana peppers *inhales* on Dutchcrunch roll. What can I say? I'm a fatass!The record for finishing the Kryptonite is 6 1/2 minutes. Say whaaa? There's enough meat in there for at least 4 regular sandwiches. I finished mine....okay my half sandwich in maybe 20 minutes and knocked out for a hour. Dangit Ike's! Good thing you're far away!
I came to Ikes expecting it to be another overrated spot. I saw the line running out the door alongside the sidewalk. My first instinct was to put my head down and be sad that I had to wait in this line for my excited friends. As the line scooted along for what seemed to be so slow, an employee came outside and offered help for those who were having trouble choosing sandwiches from their plentiful menu. I asked her for recommendations and she asked me for what I would want in my sandwich. By giving her ingredients that I would like in my sandwich, she listed three different sandwiches and what were in them. Her helpfulness and description of the sandwiches made my mouth water and I was soon beginning to become more excited than my friends.My first impressions of it being overrated was WRONG. Ikes must be a staple to those who live in the area because it would be for me if i lived in SF.There are so many options on the menu and a secret menu as well. If I have the chance, I'd try them all! The Dutch Crunch bread is delicious! All the ingredients in my sandwich was delicious! There are several sauces to choose from to compliment your sandwich ingredients. Also, I loved how Ikes had a variety of bottled soft drinks to choose from. Each order comes with chips with very different flavors. I chose a Dill flavored bag of chips which didnt compliment my sandwich too well but was delicious on its own.
Good sandwiches. No doubt.
I don't care who you are, Ike's has a 99.9% chance of featuring the sandwiches of your dreams. Gluten-free? They have it. Vegan? Please, you have 17 vegan sammiches to choose from. Carnivore? By all means, drool over the pastrami, ham, turkey, bacon, halal chicken, fried chicken, sliced rib eye ... it goes on and on. Their endless veggie, vegan and carnivorous combinations are too much to display on one blackboard so to access their full list, check out their online menu while you wait in line. Remember, sharing is caring so it's fun to split with a friend and tackle two delicious sandwiches at a time. After agonizing deliberation, I settled on the Paul Reubens with poppy seed coleslaw, pastrami and swiss nestled between two out-of-this-world pieces of Dutch Crunch bread. Crazy messy. Crazy delicious. For those who hate waiting, too bad. The line will always be long but it goes quickly and they're efficient. Plus you get a bag of Dirty chips with your order! As a tip, there's not much room to sit and in order not to PO the neighbors, no sitting on stoops either. There are a few parks nearby so plop down on a bench and dig in. Also, I love their pop-culture sandwich names. Some nuggets are:"Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian""Name of Girl I'm Dating" (I think you're supposed to actually say the name)"Peg Bundy""Menage a Trois"Food can have a sense of humor!
4,592 reviews later and Ike is still the man. I remember I first heard of this place when they were showcased on the news years ago because they were being forced to shut down by the city! Thankfully, they didn't and their store got bigger instead. Anyway, every time I eat here, I am not disappointed. I think all their sandwiches are good so long as you have a general idea of what you want. So far, I've had the Matt Cain and the Damon Bruce and they're both deeelish! I'd recommend eating the sandwiches ASAP though because they do tend to become soggy and not as good with time. Each sandwich is about $10.00 and it comes with chips and a lollipop. The people that work here have always been friendly and sweet. Ike's is the way to go if sandwiches is what you're craving!Plenty of 2 hour parking outside and they accept credit cards.
I got the We're Just Friends sandwich, which came with halal chicken, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and orange glaze. That joint was on point! The 10-15 minute wait is worth it. The chips were outstanding as well.I recommend heading over to Mission Dolores Park on a nice Saturday afternoon lunch date to complete the SF experience.
Order the coming home for thanks giving! Amazing rolls and service!! Loved the voodoo chips too. Rolls are huge so you wont be hungry all day.
I have to say it's a bit intimidating when you come here for your first time. There are pages and pages of sandwiches with names that doesn't exactly tell you what it is. But once you figure the menu out, you will be in love with this place like everyone else. The sandwiches here are not cheap ($10+ each) but it does come with chips and a lollypop.My fave? The Hollywood's SF Cheesesteak. Super good!The downside to this place? Aside from the price, the wait. On a good day, it takes about 40+ mins. 20min in line to order and another 20min for them to make your sandwich after you ordered. There is an option to phone in your order. If you do, just skip the line and go right up to the register when you show up.
Really inventive kinds of sandwiches , but I feel like the ingredients are not very fresh. It's best to order ahead especially at lunch time because it can get so crowded.
The hubby and I have been here a couple times. The first was last year after seeing the Man v Food episode. He had some hot link sammie and I had some seafood one...both were quite delicious. We were very impressed.Thanks to Scoutmob, we were reminded of just how delicious their sammies are. I got the free Elvis Keith and my hubby had the Menage a Trois. Both sammies were flavorful. The 1/2 order is pretty filling enough. The wasabi mayo in the Elvis Keith is pretty subtle but still had great flavor. Even my daughter really liked the Menage and she's a picky eater. She even asked to come back to get that sandwich again and this was before they were done eating the sandwich.They have such a huge menu! And it's a nice surprise to find a lollipop in the bag.Adam Richman and Scoutmob, we humbly offer you our gratitude.
My favorite sandwich place! This has become a must stop every time I visit the bay area. I have not yet been disappointed by the sandwiches here. I recently just tried and Menage a Trois on Dutch Crunch bread and was blown away. I even felt dirty and stuffed it with mozzarella sticks and jalapeno poppers. I could have probably done without the additions. I loved the sweetness of the sauce that went with the halal chicken. The Dutch Crunch bread was perfect. Fresh, soft and crunchy. I split a sandwich with my friend and probably should have been more greedy about it and got my own sandwich. It was that good.I came here around noon time on a Saturday and the line was not too bad and I also scored parking right in front of the place. By the time I left, the line was out the door.
We ordered the sandwiches for our off-site meeting. The delivery was an hour late. We did not have our lunch until 1:30pm ish. The sandwiches are great! Everyone in team likes them. There is lots of mayonnaise on it. I am not sure how healthy it is. But guess once a while is not going to hurt too much.
Good tasting sandwiches. I remember going here when they first opened across the street, before they blew up. The prices were great and not much wait. These days you're gonna wait and the prices are kinda high. So I get one about once a year instead of once a week.
Ike's Place by far has the best sandwiches in the Bay area, possibly even all of California. It definitely lives up to the hype. I was in the bay visiting a friend in July who raves about Ike's as her go-to sandwich joint. After doing some sight-seeing, we headed to Ike's for lunch to pick up a sandwich for a picnic at Dolores Park. I'd heard the sandwiches were huge, so my daughter and I shared the Tony Soprano. It was soo delicious that I wish I could've had the whole thing to myself. I was in such euphoria while eating that I can't recall exactly what was on the sandwich. What really sets Ike's Place apart from any other sandwich shop is the bread, the Dutch Crunch. TO DIE FOR!My friend recommended the Matt Cain sandwich. It's so good that she has never been able to pass it up to try one of the many others on the menu. I still find myself craving a sandwich from Ike's, wishing there was one in southern CA.
Best Sandwiches on the planet. Just make sure you call ahead and pre-order, or you'll be waiting a looooong time for your delicious treat!
I had the spiffy tiffy which costs me $9.99 plus tax and it includes a bag of chips and a lollipop. The sandwich tasted amazing with everything on it with especially the pesto. The sandwich was so fulfilling that I shared it with my boyfriend and I was still full throughout the day. The staffs were young chill people, look like hippies and were cool. The decor was simple and plain. I recommend this to anyone and have them give it a try!
The food is worth the wait. Usually a long line but their sandwiches are delicious and unique.
I just want to clarify initially that I don't like sandwiches that much. That being said...This place is actually great. They really have the proportions perfect on the bread, meat, and toppings. So many choices with the fillings, and they make things from the online menu, even if it's not on the menu board at the actual location.I got the Nacho Boy, and as a bread-hater, I actually found the sandwich quite good. I really dislike places that give you 4x as much bread as the filling, so that your taste buds are dulled by all the tasteless wheat in the bread part of the sandwich. But this place was really generous with the fillings, and the meat itself was very warm and not dry at all, which I think is really difficult to do with non-luncheon meat in sandwiches. The order also came with chips and candy.Extremely friendly staff. Not much space to sit, so you have to grab and go, for which the park nearby is really good for enjoying your meal.
Good sammiches. Good house made soda. What more could you ask for except a bit less sauce. My friend had to eat her sammich with a spoon last time I visited.I'll be back anyhow.
Personally, I don't get what the big deal is. I've been to Ike's a few times based on the positive word of mouth. I've had a few different sandwiches of theirs. And it's all just sort of ok. Definitely not worth the wait.If this place were, say, a not so busy sandwich shop across the street from your work, that would be great. It would even be above average for that kind of place. But waiting in line for like 30 minutes or more just because they have a decent garlic mayonnaise? No thanks. I'll note that I'm certainly in the minority when it comes to Ike's. Lots of people like it and the business is expanding. They now have an Ike's in Redwood City and (I think) Palo Alto.
The Best sandwich store i've ever been to.
I think I went to sandwich heaven. I came twice on my recent trip to the bay. I was supposed to try other places while I was there but my first food day was so good I had to go again!I ordered the Menage a trois the first day and the hot momma huda the next. Both were amazing! My favorite of the 2 was the menage a trois. It had halal chicken, honey, mustard, bbq, cheddar, pepper jack and swiss. Definitely order the dutch crunch bread as well. It makes the sandwich extra tasty! I wish I could have it more often! It's a definite stop every time I'm in the bay.
I absolutely love Ike's.... I have not come across a better sandwich shop in years. YOU HAVE TO CHECK THEM OUT!!!
Great hearty flavorful sandwiches.Jaymee Sirewich - Thick piece of chicken fried chicken, cheesy pepper jack, ranch, and ike's yellow bbq (aka honey mustard sauce). This was a great yet messy sandwich. Eat it right away since it'll get pretty soggy. Chicken wasn't dry, it was crisp and moist. Dutch crunch bread is better than Little Lucca's in South City. It was soft and not too dense.Say Hey - Pastrami, Bacon, Swiss. It was a good sandwich. Not as messy. Meat was a good amount. Pastrami wasn't too salty.Called in my order and proceeded to tell the guy what I wanted but he stopped me and asked me a few questions regarding my name, etc so let the people at Ike's ask you what you want first. I came here on a Monday afternoon around 2 and parking was still pretty scarce so my friend turned into to drop me off. Man before I could even set foot outside the car, this lady and ALSO a staff member came to tell us we couldn't park in the driveway. I told them I was jus being dropped off.Going inside the sandwich shop felt like a regular standard warehouse. U won't really see anyone make your sandwich. Just stacks of chip boxes and a metal counter with some cash registers. I like it but not am in LOVE with it. But hey you just might. My advice, get something unique and leave the standard sandwiches for another time.
Hmm... where to begin.Good stuff first:The sandwiches we ordered were REALLY REALLY REALLY emmer efffing good. We ordered the Damen Bruce and the Matt Cain.Not-so-good stuff:-One of the staff members was NOT wearing gloves while preparing the sandwiches. As I was standing in line you can see right through the kitchen as you draw closer to the registers and everyone that was preparing the food was wearing gloves except for one girl. Other qualities that I will not mention that the girl was doing did not sit well with me. -It's pretty steep for lunch. We ordered 2 sandwiches, 2 drinks and 2 bags of chips all for a little over $30.I came here about a month ago and have yet to return. Although I do like their sandwiches (yes they are among the best I've ever had), I don't see myself making the effort to come back. I can't seem to get over the girl not wearing gloves...
I came here since my friend recommended it to me. She saw Ike's place was featured in Man vs. Food. I got the Mnage a Trois. There was limited seating but your order comes with free chips and lollipops. I got the dutch crunch bread since I've never had it until I came to SF. The halal chicken was delicious!!! It was tender and the sauce made it tangy. So good, I was licking my fingers at the end haha. The sandwiches are pretty big so you could definitely share it with a friend. I'll be back to try more !!!
I'm sorry...I don't get it. Would give them 3.5 stars if I could. They're slightly better than average...especially considering the wait. There is much better in the city.We had some friends come in from out of town that really wanted to try Ikes. Since I've never been...figured it was a good opportunity to try several sandwiches in one sitting.We ordered the Menage, Matt Cain, Lincecum, Name of Girl I'm Dating, Paul Reubens and Jim Rome. We cut everything into smaller pieces...so everyone got a change to try each one.The Menage was the one everyone preferred. I also liked the Paul Reubens, so I would recommend those two. As for the others...they were just okay. I do agree with other reviews that they drench the sandwiches in sauce.I'm glad I tried them...crossed it off my list...and happy tourist line up here instead of the better places in the city.
This was our first stop on our SF trip. I'm so glad it was.These are the most bomb sandwiches I've ever had in my life. I'm so sad that they don't have any locations in SoCal but I guess we have Earl's (eh, not as amazing after trying Ike's)We were lucky and didn't have to wait in line since we came in during their off times.These are seriously the best sandwiches ever! I think what makes the sandwiches is the sauce they use, as well as the Dutch Crunch bread. They taste best if you eat them when they're warm. Highlights: My all-time favorite sandwich is the Menage A Trois (It's Halal too!) The sandwiches come with chips as a side. Get the Voodoo Chips! They're a hybrid between Salt & Vinegar and BBQ chips. So good. The 'Going Home for Thanksgiving' was pretty good as well but since I had it when it had cooled down, it wasn't as amazing as the 'Menage A Trois'The Spiffy Tiffy is another good option. If you're in SF even for just a day you HAVE to come here. I'd avoid coming here during lunch time because the line can get pretty long; the line is shorter around 3-4pm.
We drove around for 30 minutes to find a spot. Frustrated, we decided to go elsewhere and then we found a free parking spot close to this place...!! Once I tasted the sandwich, I realized that it was all worth it.Had a Tom Brady and my wife had a sometimes I am vegetarian on dutch crunch. I found mine very tasty and flavorful. A great place for vegetarians as we don't have to ordered the only veggie sandwich on the menu!!
BEST sandwhiches I have EVER had in my freaking life!!!!! PERIOD!!!!!!!!!!!If they had beer or wine, then I'd give 5 stars.
Is it good? Yeah, of course it's good. Do I still prefer Little Lucca on the Peninsula? Absolutely. But what gets Ike's their 4-star rating from me is their service. These employees kick ass at their jobs, and I find myself tipping 50% every time I'm there. Good sandwich. Excellent service. Totally worth the trip.

But here is the actual Man VS Food segment:youtube.com/watch?v=Y1cG***********************************************************************************************I'm the 3612th Yelper to review Ike's Place... 3.5 STARS, but I'll round up.FML#1: Its hard to judge distance with Android Maps on a smartphone...so apparently I dragged the smart, lovely but starving wife Erica P, also Yelp Elite, on a half mile walk to Ike'sFML#2: When we finally got to Ike's, unlike what I saw on TV, we noticed there weren't any tables outside, nor anywhere else to sit for that matter besides the waiting benches inside...I felt the wifey's Look of Death without even looking at her...Travel Channel must have staged some tables before filming this episode...LIARS!FML#3: I didn't know we could've called in our order in advance cause from waiting in line to sandwich completion it was about 30-40min until we finally got our food...it could've been 2min...doh! But we did get to see a guy wearing nothing but his backpack pass by while we were waiting. Luckily it was a warm afternoon. With another month left of swimsuit season, and the fact that I'm a cheapass, I decided not to order the $19.91, 4 pound, Kryptonite Sandwich as Adam Richmond did. But I did get the $9.99 delicious and tasty "Spiffy Tiffy" on the Dutch Crunch bread, which that and Ike's double ultra secret Dirty Sauce, makes the sandwich special. I tried a bite of the wife's veggie "Pee Wee"...meh...FML#4. FML#5: Unfortunately, we ate our sandwiches while walking the half mile back to the rental car because our parking meter was getting dangerously close expiring...a parking ticket would've been FML#6. Good sandwiches...but according to Erica P., this was her 2nd "Most UnRomantic Date with Chun Pee" ever. The 3rd worst was Viva Pops date in San Diego. I don't want even to talk about #1 worst date ever, but I'll just say that like Lance Armstrong, I've learned how to get by in life just fine on one testicle. (sarcasm)
SO GOOD. OMGFOOD. Is my review very heavily influenced by the fact that my friend and I got a sandwich to go and ate it when we were exhausted and starving? Of course. San Francisco is so hilly. It wasn't because we're so unfit we couldn't walk up one hill without getting tired. (Jk it totally was.) The sandwiches are quite large, and I could finish one by myself, but probably wouldn't want to unless I were really hungry, which I actually often am. I don't remember what I got, but it had some kind of fake chicken in it. And avocado. Chips are also good.
If you don't give them 5 stars, you're wrong. Period. Yeah, sometimes the line is long, but all good things come to those who wait, and their sandwiches are better than "good".
When I lived down the block, this used to be my jam!Now, I dream of stopping by again, and will eventually. Good lunch spot, great sandwiches.
Ike's in SF is a solid 4 stars, but their Oakland location gets an extra star just because there's nothing around to compete with it. So, it shines even brighter relative to its competition. Everything about their sandwiches is great. The ingredients are always fresh. I'm particularly fond of their bread and their dirty sauce. And on top of all that the staff is pleasant and service is quick. At Ike's what you get is high quality and high flavor. I love it!
Wow. Wowowwoweewowowwee. The ever-so-rare five star review? No possible way!Almost four thousand reviews? Four and a half star review average? Can't be that good, right? Just the hypebeast rearing its ugly head. I mean, it was on Man v. Food, so it's all just marketing and such, right?Once again, wow! It IS that good. This is not your standard deli with ham and cheese and such. To call this place off the hook is an affront against hooks! I guess the best way I can describe this place is it's everything Quizno's probably wanted to be but failed miserably at achieving, since they're a corporate joint. Fresh, quality ingredients, all made in-house, and prepared fresh. Warm or cold, your sandwich is going to be hearty, healthy (sometimes), or a total gut buster. But either way, it's exactly the way you want it. It has to -- there's like eleventy kabillion different permutations of sandwich here.It is a San Francisco institution of sorts, so be prepared to be bombarded with, among other things, all things Bay Area sports. Sandwiches such as the Barry Z., the Matt Cain, the Lincecum, the Damon Bruce, and the Jaymee Sirewich (which we devoured) populate the menu. So as a visiting LA cat, that was a little crazy, but all good in the end. I was like, where's the LA sandwich spot that rocks the Matt Kemp, the Kershaw, the Chad B., and the Lindsay Sotowich? Heh.Protip(s): Their menu is massive, so it won't hurt to check their menu online so you're prepared once you come in. You can also order ahead too, which helps once the place gets packed. It can also get pricy the crazier you get with your sandwich, but $12 easily fed the wife and I.
Went on Mother's Day and was our first time to Ike's.. Ike was actually there! So nice and personable.All Mother's , we soon found out, received a free sandwich!.. an unexpected surprise and nice touch, Ike's!! Service was great and they helped us newbies on figuring out how to do this, ording a wonderful build your own sandwiches.. can't wait to go back and try another one, maybe different specialty sandwich next time.
The sandwiches are the best. I love Ike's. I always order three sandwiches, but end up feeding six people. For me, I always get the nacho boy. I tried the mnage a trois and it's good, but the nacho boy is perfect because I love mushroom and avocado :D my mommy gets the spiffy tiffy which is like the nacho boy but with chicken and pesto. My daddy gets the pastrami charmed life. The sandwiches are so big, I split them with my grandparents and a friend. Sandwiches come with chips and a lollipop. What more can you ask for, for about $10-11 a sandwich?Service is super nice. I remember the first time I got lost going to Ike's because it's located in a small little corner. I called them asking for direction and the girl on the phone was nice and informative even though I knew Ike's was probably packed.Line is pretty long, so once in a while when I get lazy, I get Ike's delivered hehe :)
I recently went to Ike's as I have sub sandwich cravings. The sandwiches are hefty and the stuffing is plenty. 12-13 bucks for a sandwich is a bit too much but these are pretty unconventional sandwiches, so its worth a try. most of the wiches i have had the dutch roll is too thick, i only wish they put more meat inside.
Good sandwiches, but too much hype! And too many dollars.
Been here many times but never wrote a review. This place got super popular around 2010/11ish so I decided to try this place. The line was 1 hour and 30 minutes. I split a Kryptonite with my friend. This is the 20$ sandwich of meat. It had salami, ham, roast beef, turkey and pastrami. I know kinda crazy. It was also stacked with a lot of veggies and their dirty sauce. Idk whats that sauce made of but it's bomb af. The meal comes with free bag of chips which aren't the traditional Frito-Lay brand, which was a nice change and a caramel apple lollipop. The wait for the sandwich was rather long but it was a small joint with a lot of business. When it finally came, it was delicious because of all the flavor and that sauce though. The Kryptonite is very filling even when I split it. Other notable sandwiches were Spiffy Tiffy and Tony Soprano. Overall, the staff was friendly and the price was decent for the taste. Way better than Subway or Quiznos. *Haven't been here in awhile so don't know wait times anymore*
Food was sooo good that I stuffed myself!
Omg goooooood sandwiches. That is all.
Best sandwich I've ever had! Got the Jim Rome on Dutch crunch. The combination I toasty, savory, and meaty was too much goodness. Seriously though, Ike's is a must try in SF. Employees are super nice, food was great, and wasn't overly expensive. Not all the sandwiches are on the menu so I'd recommend checking out their website (ilikeikesplace.com) and deciding what you want to get first. Also, the wait seems like it can get long. I went for dinner and the place was pretty empty and it still took around 10 mins to get my sandwich.
I'm sure they don't need my review, but um...how do I convince them to open up a place in NYC?! I don't even like sandwiches, but my friend (who lives in SF) suggested we eat there for lunch. She told me to look at the menu and give her my order and she'll call in about an hour ahead of time to pick it up. Apparently, it takes a while for them to get everything ready because maybe everyone wants to eat it all the time??I ordered the Jim Rome and oh my...it was DELICIOUS. The red pesto was so flavorful. I can't believe I devoured the whole sandwich. They also come with Dirty chips! Yum!Eat this in a park where you can feed your lettuce scraps to a million of wild/leashed park dogs.PROS: AMAZING SANDWICHES, good priceCONS: NONE NONE NONE!!
Was in the San Francisco area and made sure to stop by Ike's place. This place definitely delivered split the Tony Soprano on Dutch crunch with my girl. We both looked at each other after the first bite and said dayum.. That dirty sauce is BOSS
I was skeptical about the place because all the hype and the pricing, but once I had that 1st bite, my mind changed. Best sandwich ever!! Was worth what you pay for. Hipster crowd. Very small and not noticeable from the street. But well worth it.
This place is friggin AWESOME. They have tons of delectable sandwich options with your choice of bread and a slather of their "dirty sauce" which is a tasty aoli. I went here for the first time on Friday and waited out in LINE during these freakish California storms and it was worth every single frigid rain drop that hit me. I ordered a "Menage a Trois" which consisted of shredded chicken, barbecue sauce, honey mustard, pepperjack cheese, cheddar cheese, and smoked gouda amongst some other fixings and it was sooo good. My friend ordered "the Pizzle" with chicken breast, bacon, ranch, cheddar, and pesto. I tried to come by on Sunday and I guess since the rain stopped the line had multiplied by 5 or 6 so unfortunately I wasn't able to try another sandwich. The carmel apple pops you'll find in the bottom of your sandwich bag are also a nice touch : )
I can't compare this place to other sandwich shops. Religious experience.Going Home for ThanksgivingJaymee SirewichJim RomeMenage A troisJust do it. Order ahead. Enjoy.Only knock is that they don't serve DIRTY CHIPS anymore. Those were the best! And Zappos chips are just not that great.
A couple of days ago, my friends extorted me to make a trip to San Francisco; which would, in turn, make it the first time I've ever been out of SoCal. After a tedious drive up the pastoral farmlands on the 101, we decided to grab lunch somewhere in the Golden City. With the guidance of Yelp, we opted to try out Ike's!First off, as with the parking for all establishments in SF, side-walks will determine your ability to stop along the busy streets. If you're lucky, you'll find a spot within the proximity or peripheral areas. The little delicatessen does not offer seating, and only really has enough real estate to hold a single line and a couple of standing-room dining areas. Secondly, expect a line! We arrived MINUTES prior to a legion of hungry high school students stampeding the cramped deli. Be aware of the number of cashiers available, since the maximum capacity is two; leaving a long line to crawl at a snail's pace at times.Here comes the good part: the actual sandwiches! These mouthwatering, heaven-between-buns, sandwiches were similar to relics of a lost world. A glimpse of an Olympia that few (okay, not so few since this place has over 4,000 reviews) have ever been graced to witness.The first sandwich I got was the Damon Bruce - a generous, heaping slab of BBQ'ed beef, drenched in a myriad of dripping sauces, garnished with lettuce and tomatoes, and topped with a couple of bronzed onion rings between two pieces of bread (I recommend either their special Dutch bread or the french roll!). It was simply glorious! I have never had a sandwich that was as delightful and orgasmic as this universal treasure. And honestly, this little sandwich shop was the highlight of my journey up north. Unfortunately, this set the bar pretty high for the rest of the weekend, where every other meal was diluted and muted behind the purity of Ike's. If none of this persuades you, perhaps our little group's last mission in SF to grab a heaping bunch of these sandwiches (I personally nabbed 3) before our long ride back to LA would inspire you to make a pilgrimage to this shrine.
Very good sandwiches but the wait was ridiculous long....My friend and I came here on a Saturday around 1:00pm. The line was already long. I think there were about 15 people in front of us.....We waited for almost half hour to place our order and another 15 minutes to wait for the sandwich. Since they have no table there, we walked to the near park to enjoy the sandwich. We got the Lincecum which had Ham, Turkey, Bacon, Avocado and Havart. OMG the sandwich was so good! All ingredients were so fresh...The portion of the sandwich was huge too. Although the wait was kinda crazy, it was definitely worth it.
Ike's place is delicious every time, and everyone seems to know it. Since there's usually a line you have to order ahead, which is really the way to do it.Every sandwich I've had there has been amazing! If you're getting them on anything other than dutch crunch you're wasting your time.Checklist (there's more I can't remember by name)LinecumWe're JUST friends
5 stars for the place i love , very
Love! Love! Love! Best sandwich place in the Bay hands down- get the Menage a Trois!!!!
Dutch crunch rolls are my favorite, and this is the first sandwich place that makes it just right. It's baked fresh with the crumbly top you expect, but it's not stale or too dry! You will immediately favor their dutch crunch over other delis' because of its unquestionable quality.Not only is the bread amazing, but the sauce/topping combinations on their menu are to die for! I usually get "Name of girl I'm dating" that has honey mustard, pepper jack cheese, halal chicken, and avocado to share with a friend. One sandwich is pretty big, and I wouldn't recommend trying to devour it on your own.Also, they have Kettle chips! Get the Salt & Vinegar!Obviously since Ike's is in the city, it's better to take the bus to get here because finding free parking in San Francisco is a nightmare.-Lucia
It's not that Ike's doesn't make a tasty sandwich, which they do. You just have to temper down your expectations. It's just that if you're not a vegetarian/vegan and the menu of meatless meats / boca burgers doesn't appeal to you, then after waiting for about 40 minutes you're going to be (A) really really hungry and (B) have high expectations. I was both (A) and (B) for my [Name of Girl I'm Dating] = Halal Chicken Breast, Honey Mustard, Avocado, PepperJack. static1.px.yelp.com/bphoTo me, the filling was just all mushed up and came out more like a chicken salad sandwich in between some good dutch crunch. - I had expected to bite into chicken pieces instead of a chicken shreds. Instead it had the consistency of more like canned chicken. - I had expected to get some honey mustard flavor with some heat from the pepperjack and instead I got a mayonaisey ooze that would squeeze out the sides each time I took a bite. And I was still hungry after my sandwich since they are on the smaller side. Overall - Ike's is good and I think I'll give them another chance if I'm in the area. Maybe I just picked the wrong one? But easily I still got to say that Lil Luccas, Roxie's, and even Sub Center are still tops in the sandwich food chain.
Delish! I love me some saucy sands!
Really Good Sandwhiches. Don't plan on eating at Ike's though. No tables.
I like Ike's. Creative and vast in selection. Really clean and a fun set of people who love creating sandwiches. It can get busy, with a line out the door at rush hours. I've had lots of their sandwiches and I haven't had a repeat yet. The last sandwich I had was the Lex Luther, which is fried chicken, chicken fried steak, steak, mozzarella sticks, Russian dressing, and American cheese. It was a mistake, but not their fault. Reading that I should have known. However I live in a fantasy world where I think I like fried food. Chicken Fried Steak! It is a behemoth of a sandwich, and it comes as two full sandwiches. I only was able to eat a forth of it. It's what I will eat for the next few days, with a huge bowl of greens at each sitting. I couldn't pass it up to try just once though. My favorite so far has been the Hollywood cheese steak. Maybe simple is my key. There are so many items on the menu, I will go back again and again. Whether you are adventurous or safe, you will find your ultimate sandwich at Ike's Place.
After writing a 1-star review regarding this unclean and unorganized establishment in 2011 when they were located on Market St., Ike himself emailed me with an update to their current location on 16th Street. I was hesitant to go, but Ike assured me it would be a better experience.The place was not very crowded when I went this time, although a small line had formed. I must note that the line to order tends to block access to the bathrooms and makes it rather inconvenient for both parties.The ordering process was more organized this time. It appears they have pick-up orders separated from those wanting to dine-in. You can order your meal, grab a seat and wait without having to fight for the cashier's attention who is taking endless phone orders while you stand there like an idiot.I could not tell you what I ordered because when the sandwich came, it looked like a sloppy mess. A lot of filler condiments, sweeteners, oils to the point where the bread is quite soggy and falls apart.I struck up a friendly chat with another girl who was experiencing her first time at Ike's. We both agreed that we do not understand what apparently makes this shop a hot spot.Was the sandwich any good? If you prefer a little ham and cheese with your mayonnaise and oil, perhaps. Both her and I did not go on to finishing our sandwiches and I can not imagine she'd be back. I know I won't.
I LOVE Ike's sandwiches as much as the next gal, but part of what makes Ike's so special is its amazing selection (particularly of veg/vegan sandwiches). So imagine my surprise when we stopped in this weekend and searched in vain for the paper menu that lists ALL the sandwiches, rather than just the few that are on the board. We were told that the full menu is online, "you can look it up if you have a smartphone." Uh... not gonna spend 10 minutes holding up the line while I try to download and scroll through that much text on my iPhone. I love Ike's, but I hope they correct the misguided decision not to have paper menus at the ready in the store.
Got the Hollywood SF Cheesesteak here, and my friend got the nacho boy. Let me just say first that our orders were mixed up, so I knocked down one star for service. Thank god I wasn't allergic to anything. The sandwiches were great and served hot. The perfect "hand food" and it's perfect on the go. The Hollywood SF Cheesesteak was great with thinly sliced rib eye, mushrooms, provolone. Sometimes simple is the way to go! Served with complimentary chips and a caramel-apple lollipop. Definitely recommend coming here!
This is the best sandwich place I have ever been to. I don't think I have words to describe how wonderful they are. They offer so many vegetarian and vegan options, which is unheard of in a sandwich place.
My boyfriend surprised me and took me to California Academy of Sciences, and before we went, we made a pit stop to Ike's Place. After reading the plethora of good reviews on Yelp, we couldn't resist!TIP: Ditch the car if you could. Or if you come here, park near Mission Dolores Park and walk--it shouldn't be too bad.When you first get here, the line looks extremely long, but it moves pretty fast, so don't be fooled into missing out on a milestone for your tastebuds!I ordered the Paul Reubens ($9.99) in Sourdough bread. It was stuffed with homemade poppy seed coleslaw, french dressing, swiss, banana peppers, and pastrami with everything (lettuce, tomato, etc). At first, I wasn't sure as to which bread would complement my sandwich well, so I asked the woman at the cashier and she was very helpful. If you're never sure of which one to get, always ask! The sandwich was completely stuffed and I savored every bite of it. I love the dirty sauce. I think the dirty sauce is what makes each sandwich so delectable.What I love about this place is that your order comes with a free bag of chips and a lollipop. You can choose from assorted flavors such as BBQ, Salt and Vinegar, Sea Salt, Maui Onion, and Funky Fusion.I think the only downside is that you can't exactly eat in there because it's really small and there's usually a lot of people. The seats that are there are usually filled, so people tend to get their sandwiches to go and walk to a park. Luckily, if you took my advice and parked near the park, you'll have a wonderful place to eat.I'm definitely coming back here again! You won't regret it!
After 4000+ reviews there's not a whole hell of a lot left to say. Yes its good. But when something's really good it deserves a little bit of extra criticism. We ordered the spiffy tiffy on Dutch crunch. We went in with our hearts set on another sandwich that was listed on menu pages and fries also pictured over and over on yelp. Nope and nope. They certainly aren't using seasonal ingredients so I'm not sure what was happening with that. We were divided on the sandwich. (Which is absolutely big enough to spit) This was Kim's favorite sandwich so far in sf. I really had my heart set on a deli style sandwich which may have tainted me. I thought the sandwich was a bit of a mess of flavors. Avocado and pesto? Also I didn't get any of the pickles or banana peppers that we requested on my half. The other half was loaded with them.  The chip selection was maybe the best I've ever seen in a deli. We opted for the Cajun dills which may have been the highlight of the meal. Also they have an unrivaled soda selection. We chose Cheerwine and if you've read any of our other reviews this is an automatic plus one million stars. I have a really hard time giving anywhere without a place to sit and eat anything more than 4 stars but the people taking orders were extremely well versed in customer service. They were offering suggestions and deftly answering questions and the park is so close it earned its fourth star. Last thought: They also ought to have a designer look at their use of space. They have serious architectural problems that are half the cause of their long line. I'm sure there is some devoted fan who is sick of waiting in line and would do the work pro bono.
The hype exceeds what they deliver. Sure, the sandwiches are tasty -- but for $10 and up, they better be good. They're made with lots of bread, which is filling but not particularly valuable (as food). And the key element to an Ike's sandwich seems to be lots of sauce slathered on there. The saucing and bread dominates the sandwich; the fillings are secondary. To add insult to injury, you get a "free" bag of chips with the sandwich. Just what we need: more empty carbs. But if you're eating at Ike's, you don't really care about the value of the food you eat. And then there's the experience of the 16th St shop itself: decorated like the basement of a college dorm and arranged to make the worst use of the space, the storefront is just unpleasant. Why the mere two cashiers have to pause in the midst of your order and go retrieve your chosen bag of chips escapes me. If Ike's thinks people can grab their own soda, then why not have them grab their own chips, too? The entire operation is rife with nonsensical shit like this. Why have the cashiers take phone orders -- interrupting the already slow line? (unless it's to create a line out the door, for advertising purpose; I'd not put Ike's past that tired maneuver). Why have signs pasted all over three walls with handwritten descriptions of sandwiches, interspersed with Lost Dog posters and band gigs and Employee of the Week ephemera? The entire set up is just sloppy. Maybe it's not a sweatshop for the employees, but it sure looks like one, on top of everything else.
Big sandwiches made from ordinary non-organic ingredients. The secret seems to be their very oily special sauce. I was underwhelmed. A great sandwich requires great ingredients. Try the ones at Birite and then tell me you still like Ike's.
What a sweet selection of organic and gluten free options. They even had my favorite hard cider! These peeps thought of everything. Got a veggie burger and instead of the usual mixture it was full of BEETS! Love it and the tree that naturally shades the patio.
The Menage-a-Trois - crunchy yet soft dutch crunch mashed with tender and flavorful chicken and savory pepper jack, cheddar and swiss, all covered in BBQ sauce, honey mustard, honey and dirty sauce - is my new heaven. The Funky Fusion dirty chips (vinegar and BBQ flavoring) are just a bonus on top.Note to vegans: the dirty sauce is mayo-based, so you may want to forego it on your sandwich. I think it's tasty enough to merit an exception though.
Bear Hug dutch crunch, extra sauce extra meat ! and then grab some biRite after
I'm sure there's nothing I can say that hasn't been said before. But damn, Ike. Damn. Them's some mighty fine sandwiches you got.
Menage a trois! Such an incredible sandwich! I have been here a few times and its so difficult to get anything but this sandwich.
Menage a trois = Bomb!
What's better than going to San Francisco and having a sandwich from Ike's Place? Doing it twice in one trip. Second time was a bonus--they brought sandwiches in to a post-work party. But the first trip was a 100% authentic real McCoy. We rolled up and jumped in line just moments before the line swelled behind us. Timing, baby. As Annie D has declared, we decided to split our sammies for ultimate flavor experience. Her Spiffy Tiffy topped my (Name of Girl I'm Dating) but both were perfectly palatable and downright delectable. We trekked down to the park for a little entertainment with our meal. I've never been offered drugs more in my life than that afternoon. But even the illicit Mary Jane (either edible or smokeable) couldn't compete with my sandwich high. It was lunch #2 for the day and I'm glad I manned up to sand up.
It is ridiculous how good a sandwich here is. Just make sure you come before or after the lunch rush. But even with the wait, it's still worth it.
Some yummy vegan options and I LOVE that they have Zappo's. Expect long lines.
I went yesterday and was surprised at how short the line was. Found out they no longer served free chips!!! Such a disappointment. Sandwich was still pretty good though - got the 'Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian' with avocado on wheat bread. Yum!
My kids love their sandwiches!
My mouth is watering just thinking about this place. Every time I come here I have such a hard time choosing what to get because of their never ending menu filled with sandwiches that sound heavenly! My choice most often ends up being the Matt Cain, which contains Godfather Sauce, Provolone, Roast Beef, Salami, Turkey. It even tastes better than it sounds.Definitely come here, it's well worth the wait!
If there's a line out the door, you really shouldn't have only ONE cashier. Also, that cashier shouldn't just take phone orders and ignore everybody in line.Free chips, lollipop = Sweet! The sandwich itself (I got a Paul Reubens (91) ) was good, nothing spectacular, but good. My boyfriend wasn't even hungry but he polished off an entire half. Needless to say, I scolded him afterwards.
Ike's Place arrived in San Francisco very shortly after I left. And for four years, I had read all of the hype (if not all 3700+ reviews), watched the Man Vs. Food feature, and looked longingly at the menu without actually getting to try it.And when I came back for a visit a few weeks ago, I beelined straight for Ike's. And because my wife is a vegetarian, and the most appealing parts of Ike's sandwiches are the non-meat parts (the sauce), I decided to go meatless as well.And their meatless meatball sub delivered on the hype, but not quite as much as my wife's Captain Corey (Vegan Chicken, Orange Glaze, Avocado, and Pepper Jack).The accompanying chips and drink selection are stellar. One warning for people with peanut allergies: The chips are cooked in peanut oil.And unlike many hyped places, Ike's actually has friendly service and sets expectations well. If only Ike's could be as ubiquitous as Subway and also maintain quality.
Wanted to go all out and ordered the Doomsday sandwich. It's basically 2 sandwiches which definitely surprised me. I would say it would be 3-4 pounds in total. What do you expect for a $19 sandwich? After 1 look, I knew this will be a challenge to finish. Took the first bite, and I'm loving the habanero sauce. It made the sandwich have the kick that I need. So even though it was Man vs Food huge, I was able to kill it in one seating because it was that freakin' good. This place is definitely not suitable for families due to the limited space. Order and call ahead. I would come back in a heartbeat when I get back to San Francisco.
All I have to say... YUMOOOOOOO! Such great & fresh sandwiches :)
DO NOT EAT HERE IF YOU HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES. I haven't ordered a sandwich here since the days where Ike was the sole sandwich maker, UNTIL today. My hiatus was spurred by the fact that twice in a row they put dirty sauce on my sandwich after I had asked for only plain mayo and veggies on my sandwich, after I specifically told them I have an allergy.After having people tell me how different of an operation Ike's is now, well oiled machine & all, and there was no other option for lunch than Cheetos from the crappy corner store, I gave them another try, AGAIN, with specific instruction, only LISTED TOPPING & veggies, NO DIRTY SAUCE. These rocket scientist sandwich makers poisoned me again!!! I guess I was the stupid one thinking they could have changed.THEIR LACK OF ATTENTION TO MY ALLERGY MAKES ME DOUBT IT'S TRUELY SAFE FOR PEOPLE WITH GLUTEN ISSUES, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER FOOD ISSUE/ALLERGY.
I miss the bay.. The weather, the vibe, the people and Ike's place.. You already know what this place is about.. You saw the picture, you've seen the travel shows.. So stop reading this and get in line before you miss out.
This was a GREAT!!!! sandwich shop. I loved the food, I loved the place, I loved everything about it. Ike's is by far the best sandwich I have ever had. I got a "Matt Cain", and my husband got a "We're just friends" both he and I were blown away by the quality of all products used and the overall flavor of the sandwich. However as you can see, this review is rated at four stars. I would have rated this as five starts if... I had not waited in line for more than an hour. While I have no problems waiting in line for a long time for perfect sandwich, I think that the ordering process was a little inefficient. I did call the number on the web site site "http://ilikeikesplace.com" to see if I could order ahead of my arrival however the phone line was busy (rightfully so, they were busy), I tried several times and when I did finally get through though nobody answered (it rang forever). Additionally, site boosts a facebook app for ordering, however it did not work on mobile (Android Galaxy S, using the facebook app and several mobile browsers) but i did try the app later on my computer and it worked without issues (pro tip, use online ordering from real computer not mobile trinket) All in all, this is a FANTASTIC sandwich shop and I will be going back as often as I can, despite the ordering complexities.
Caveat: This is for the gluten free sandwich onlyPlus 2 starts for even having gluten free options!!Plus 1 star for it tasting really goodMinus 2 stars for it being the smallest, saddest, little sandwich to ever cost more than $10. For realz, see this picture: yelp.com/user_local_photI really love Ike's place, but please realize that gluten free folks need to eat the same amount of food as standard people. We are a strong people and require the same amount of calories.
BOMB!! They really know how to blend flavors together and make a mind blowing sandwich! BEST sandwiches EVER!
I don't think anybody walks out of here unsatisfied! So this Ike's place had to relocate due to the ginormous line that it created out of the neighborhood and the neighbors got mad instead of appreciative that they lived right next to an amazing sandwich place!The relocation is nice though; a much bigger store than it used to be and still had a line; just don't get them kicked out again by littering or loitering with your sandwich on the sidewalk. OK Sandwich talk time:Hollywood's SF CheesesteakSpiffy TiffyName of Girl I'm DatingLove TriangleMake em either spicy by adding a side of jalapenos or Siracha sauce and you are one golden motherlover.These are made to order with an amazing sauce + love that embraces your belly. That and grab a view at Dolores Park, make your way to Bi-Rite Creamery after. I AM TOTALLY DOING THAT THIS WEEKEND NOW. I CRAVE IT.
The staff is friendly, and they know how to treat customers well (on the phone, in person, and even if you walk in a little late sometimes). The sandwiches are always on point. Jaymee Sirewich is our favorite, hold the tomato and lettuce so that it doesn't get soggy. Great drinks and chips too!
Menage A Trois? Hell yea! It was orgasmicly best one I'd ever had! And I would go for more no matter how long I have to wait. But between you and me, just call it in and then go get it...shhh!
5 star sandwiches in general from Ike's, 4 stars here because I don't have a super good idea of this location's unique assets in terms of service and prep. But my experiences have all been pretty great. anywhere.Favorites: Going Home for Thanksgiving, Name of the Girl I'm Dating, and far too many others...
I wish you would have made me love you Ike's!! I came here after doing the Color run with my team AFTER we took showers. There wasn't a line which was AWESOME and we were all ridiculously hungry. I got the Bruce Damon ( rib eye, BBQ, provolone, beer battered onion rings) and it comes with a bag of chips, yay! I really wanted to love my sandwich but my rib eye was pretty dry and the Dutch Crunch wasn't crunchy! I was pretty sad since it was $13! The dirty sauce is very delicious though and I highly recommend everyone to get it on their sandwich! There also aren't any tables and only benches on the walls so my friends and I found some nice seats along the street curb around the corner. We were SUPER hungry. My boyfriend did get the Kryptonite which I believe is stuffed with everything! He got two sandwiches that were stuffed to the max so I definitely think that was worth the $20 he paid for it. ( Weird thing is that it doesn't come with chips!O_o) The staff was really friendly and there are SO MANY choices at Ike's. The wall in the store doesn't even have all possible sandwiches. You definitely want to check the menu online before you order. Can't wait to come back though!
Best sandwich in the world? It's definitely under consideration.With Yelp as my handy dandy guide, I went searching for the best of San Francisco. A sandwich place as the most reviewed? Suspicion arose. But the moral of the story: always trust Yelp. Because Ike's Place is where it's at.Like a newbie, we stumbled in close to immediately after opening not knowing the protocol. Disoriented, we ordered. She went Elvis Keith (chicken, teriyaki, wasabi mayo, swiss); I did Matt Cain (roast beef, turkey, salami, godfather sauce, provolone). Cashier asked what kind of bread, she asked for a rec, he said it's good on french. I did the same.Sandwiches were good and tasty. I enjoyed the dirty sauce, which isn't as drip down your arm dirty as I expected. Still, a solid sandwich.I go back to the Yelps later, and read the top-rated. Dutch Crunch?! Menage a Trois?! I was in despair. I had a good sandwich, but I wanted a mind-blowing sandwich. I had to go back.The fiance got so sick of my complaining that she vowed a return trip before our dash to the airport. Airplane food, imo. But would the dirty sauce set off security checkpoint? Stepping ahead: No worries there; they got through just fine.Second trip back, and I know the drill now. Call ahead, pick up order. Brilliant! Menage a trois (chicken, honey, honey mustard, bbq, pepper jack, swiss, cheddar) on dutch crunch. Add the banana peppers. Oh my god. Heaven in my mouth. Better than first class food. I'm drooling just writing about it. Got her the Spiffy Tiffy (chicken, mushrooms, avocado, pesto, provolone, pepper jack), also a winner.The sliced meat sandwich is nice, but the chicken is where it's at. Vegan options are also available. Dirty sauce is good. Additional sauces (of any kind) are better. Dutch Crunch. Call ahead. And oh yeah, dirty chips come with the 'wich. Ike's Place. #WINNING.
This is THE PLACE to stop before headed to Dolores Park to bathe in the sun. Plus, you can't beat the caramel apple sucker they give you in the bag with napkins.Score!Oh, and ask for the secret sauce.
Simply amazing. Go. Go often.
Came here while I was in San Fran as a recommendation from a dear friend. It was AMAZING. We came in early in the morning so there was no line. We ordered the menage a toi? something like that... It was incredible. The crunchy bread they put all the stuff in was awesome. The "dirty sauce" was scrumptious and made my taste buds explode. A little pricy for just a sandwich but if the food is good, it is worth it! I loved this place more than Earl's Sandwiches. Must try if you're visiting San Francisco!
Quintessential SF. Huge sandwiches, great selection. Get the meatball.
By far the BEST sandwich I have ever, ever had.We came here on a Saturday afternoon and the wait was long as expected. We waited about 30-45 min total for a total of three sandwiches. I ordered the Kryptonite, which probably weighs about 3 lbs. This thing was massive and amazing. Like you think there would be too many ingredients in this sandwich but definitely entices the taste buds. I thought I would be able to finish the whole thing but I was wrong. I ate half of it and ate the other half for dinner. Definitely a spot to check out if you are in the SF area. Parking is a little bit of difficult, whatever is available on the street is what you get. There wasn't a designated spot to eat our food when we got it, so we just ate in our car. Just remember to bring napkins and an appetite.
I've got to admit, Ike's is one of those places that gets the 4 star treatment instead of 5 star because they're so busy and a little overpriced. Deep down though, there's a feeling that you could plan your time of eating an hour ahead and eat Ike's everyday and be happy for the rest of your life lol. The King Koopa is my go to.
Big heaping sandwich & nice day in the park?! Um, YES PLEASE!A plethora of overstuffed, overly satisfying, freshly constructed, totally won't bust the bank, mouthwatering subs with quirky (and yet SO appropriate) monikers. What's not to like? My favorite absolutely has to be the Jaymee Sirewich (Fried chicken, pepper jack cheese, ranch dressing, and golden BBQ sauce on a delicious Dutch Crunch)(PLUS: Of course you gotta add those mozzarella sticks to speed up the inevitable heart attack).Believe the hype. Believe the zillions of 5 star Yelp reviews. Ike's is an institution!
Went back for the same sandwich last week, Barry z + bacon... It's so killer on Dutch crunch bread. Their chip selection is definitely interesting but I got the salt& vinegar ones and they were yummy, my boyfriend got the spicy voodoo and they were delish, I was super hesitant to try them but glad I did. Love their drink selection too, one of the best ginger ales I've ever had & I can never say no to cane cola. We will definitely be back!
Matt Cain, Matt Cain, Matt Cain!!I am generally not a big fan of fancy sandwiches, however, the first time I tried Ike's Place my mind was changed. Friendly staff, coupled with amazing sandwiches negated the downside of having to wait a half hour in line the first time I went to their 16th street location. In addition to this, to pass the time, they had a staff member outside shooting off trivia questions to the patrons waiting in line. Prizes ranged from lollypops to Ike's limited edition t-shirts . . . finally my wealth of useless knowledge came in handy!! As is probably evident from my opening line, my favorite sandwich here is the Matt Cain (named after the Giants pitcher, duh) which has roast beef, salami, turkey, provolone, Ike's famous dirty sauce, and godfather sauce on Dutch crunch bread. I really can't say enough about Ike's sauces, they are delicious without overwhelming the other ingredients or making my dutch crunch all soggy! I have tried other sandwiches here, but always end up coming back to my old favorite. If you have the chance to try this one of a kind spot, I highly recommend not being taken aback by the line and just trying it, it's worth it! Bonus points if you can wait to get to Dolores park before devouring your sandwich...the view and sandwich make for a great SF afternoon!
Overrated. And I say that even though I waited 5 minutes for my sandwich. Twice. Make sure you call your order in just in case there is a line, and take your sandwich to Dolores to eat.I do want to point out that I accidentally ordered the Menage a Trois for my vegetarian friend, and she loved it. Oops.
I don't even like sandwiches. HOW DID YOU GET ME HOOKED?!?!?!?!?I've tried the Menagio troi (THIS IS A MUST! It is a sweet honey serenity for any mouth!!!!!!) and the Elvis Kieth. I'd say...the sandwiches are WAY overpriced...it's $10-20 for one... but boy it is actually really good.The only con i can think of is the extremely long line that you should be prepared to stand in. I came here on a Friday around 1:45pm and we waited for nearly 45 minutes before we got our sandwiches...
Always been a big fan of Ike's. Their newer location is so much better then the little hole in the wall place and the line moves fast enough. They have a good meat and veggie menu so there is something there for everyone. The only complaint I have is that the sandwiches as delicious as they are, are very messy to eat and pretty damn big. So there is no eating half and saving the rest for later. But that's really just splitting hairs. Ike's is awesome
So what has changed in the past 3 years with Ikes let see...They moved from 16th street to lime on market then back to 16th(bigger spot).Been featured on man vs food. Blew my mind away the first couple of times ive been there.And open up a bunch of other locations all over the bay area. Somewhere between 3 moves or expansion - its lost its mojo.The menu seems to be more refined, but still offers every sandwiches they have made in the past. Maybe its because its not ike making my sandwich giving it that extra kick. The sandwich i had today was not the sandwich i had 3 years ago. Not the same sandwich that made me go back the day after. The sandwich i had today was super runny - with sauce over powering everything. Although their dutch crutch still remains good and fresh. This is what i hate. When a business is a underdog they aim to please everybody, but once they blow up and become superstars they sometimes lose their way or forget where they come from.
Ok, it's officially time to update my review for Ike's: 2.5 stars.By now I've tried 5 sandwiches here and have only been pleased with one, the "Going Home For Thanksgiving" (turkey, cranberry, sriracha, among other ingredients), and this is because it's the only well-balanced sandwich, in part because of the flavors but also in part because they actually put enough meat on it! The "Ex-girlfriend," for example, is supposed to contain salami and bacon. I found ONE layer of salami and only faint hints of bacon in my sandwich; the rest of it was a thick layer of guac and cheap shredded iceberg lettuce. WTF? That's pathetic, and quite frankly, a rip-off for $9.99! Also, get their sourdough bread here - it's much crunchier than the famed dutch crunch (which in fact is NOT crunchy at all...and most likely not Dutch).When I think about the meals I've had at Ike's I don't ever think, "yeah, Ike's sandwiches, I'd love to have one again!" It's just so...meh. I've experienced better.
Still going strong after all these years. The Spiffy Tiffy (Avocado, Halal Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepper Jack, Pesto, Provolone) and the SF Giants (Avocado, Bacon, Mushrooms, Swiss, Turkey) taste similar ... but similarly great. Might prefer the Spiffy Tiffy a bit more but both excellent.Call in your orders ahead of time to avoid the ridiculously long lines.
I absolutely love this place. The food was incredible and they had a great variety of drinks, and chips to choose from to go with my sandwich. Large, quality sandwich with a huge selection of bread. It was definitely the best sandwich place that I've ever been to.The only thing that I didn't really didn't like was that there was not much seating space, but other than that I really loved everything about it.Fantastic service, and kind people. I actually want to go again just thinking about it. I would recommend it to anyone.
In the heart of Castro, you best believe SIZE MATTERS. And Ike's got 'em big enough for grown men to share.PS You can call in your order for faster service!
I've actually met Ike before, but never knew his shop was this popular. I was nearby, so I decided to try it out.I expected a ridiculous line, but it wasn't as bad considering it was during the peak afternoon hours on a sunday. I did a quick yelp and had to try a menage trois. I opted for no honey mustard, since I absolutely gag at the slightest idea of that nasty yellow stuff (shoutout to ketchup!). Also, I added bacon for a dollar. Anyways, I didn't have a chance to it eat my sandwich right away, but I toasted it that night, and it was simply amazing. A great mix of ingredients, and the taste just explodes in your mouth (that's what she said.)You get a bag of dirty chips with your order, and they serve a variety of different beverages such as bottled lemonade, sodas, and water. Prices were a little on the high side, but overall Ike's did a good job on a first impression. I shall be back.
Ike's is great for sandwiches, and maybe it's because I'm not a huge fan of meat and bread but it wasn't anything I'm dying to go back for. If I'm in the area again, I will return! But I wouldn't go out of my way for it. If I could, I would actually give it 3.5 stars, but I was met with a friendly staff and a relatively short wait time.
Ike's is good enough. I know this sound horribly bland, but the reviews led me to expect sandwiches that were knockouts--bright , bursting with flavor and unique. What I tasted instead were decent but rather simple things. The sauces were a bit pungent and likeably earthy though not completely compatible with the meat, sometimes blunting it. The space (functionally dreary or drearily functional)didn't help the experience, but the service was efficient. Although not special by any means, the menu has, for the area anyway, a pretty fair price-to quality-ratio. In short, if I am nearby and hungry and don't have to stand in line (it's not that good), I will go back.
Three of my friends had told me about this place. I finally visited San Francisco and stopped by to see what all of the hype was about. Doesn't look like much from the outside and even less on the inside, no tables just a few chairs and the cash register adorn the interior. I ordered the Mayoose's Ca-BLT (Avocado, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and cheddar) on french bread. Never have I had a more proper BLT. The bread had a crusty exterior with an ever so fluffy interior. The bacon was thick and crispy as it always should be. The lettuce and tomato did their job and added a fresh bite to it all. All of this was covered in a luscious blanket of avocado that was spread all up in the interior of this sandwich. The rich creaminess of the avocado perfectly contrasted the salty crunchiness of the bacon. All of this with a side of Voodoo Hot chips. You can't go wrong man.
Tip: call ahead! The line gets pretty long, but if you call in, you can walk in and pick it up pretty quickly. I've actually never heard of this place until last week. We got here at about 1:15, which is probably one of the worst times to go. Thankfully, we beat the big rush after we got our sandwiches! The line was out the door after we had our sandwiches. Ike's has lots of character and personality. The menu is full of creatively named sandwiches, from the [Name of the Girl I'm Dating] to ones named after Giants players. You can also add mozzarella sticks to your sandwich. WHY DON'T MORE PLACES OFFER THIS? The staff was really nice. The cashiers were energetic and friendly, and acted like they liked their jobs, which is always a big plus. With your sandwich, they give you kettle chips and SURPRISE! A caramel apple pop. They also give you a zillion napkins. They have no tables and a few seats inside the restaurant, so you're going to have to find somewhere to eat your sandwich. We went to Safeway and ate there.. gotta get creative! The sandwich itself was good. I don't think I'd ever wait in a long line for one, but it was good. Meat to bread ratio was great. Sourdough was fluffy and soft. Sandwich filled me up. Can't really ask much more from a sandwich. tl;dr: Interesting place, good sandwich, no tables, CARAMEL APPLE POP.
I wasn't ready. I knew they'd be delicious. I knew they'd be everything I wanted from a sandwich. I knew they'd blow my mind ... and still, I wasn't ready.I had about two hours to kill in San Fran and knew there was only one spot for lunch - Ike's! World famous for it's sandwich deliciousness. I traveled down there with a friend to the new location (since they were forced to move from the old one after their neighbors complained about the monster lines snaking down the block.) I was ready to stand in line for however long it took to get my meal but then we walked in and found ... no line! Holy hell. We walked right up to the counter to order.Ike's isn't a big place. One room with a counter and then giant menu of sandwiches written on the wall behind it. There's a few chairs to sit in and wait for your sandwich to be made, but you're most likely not going to be able eat here. My recommendation? Dolores Park is literally a five-minute block down the road - take it to go and sit in that beautiful park.But I digress - my sandwich! I got up to the counter and there was a really nice dude behind the counter with some serious geek tattoos, like the Green Lantern symbol. I stated it up front, "Look, this may be my one and only time here at Ike's. What do you suggest I get?" I'm sure he gets the question all the time, but he was really nice about it. He told me the most popular was the Mnage  Trios but he particularly thought the best sandwich was the "We're JUST friends" (or the opposite of the Mnage  trios, heh), which was fried chicken, avocado, fresh veggies and delicious sauce. I went for it.It was ... amazing. Amazing. AMAZING! What you want every sandwich to be. Fresh, crispy, tasty, every bite better than the last. MMMmmmmm....It was pricey - the sandwich with a bag of chips (and a surprise lollipop at the bottom) was about $12. Still, totally worth it. Totally totally worth it. Don't miss this spot if in the city. Fight the lines if needed. Do it ... and then bring me one.
Food: 5/5 - The numerous options they have - my personal fave being #1/2 Spiffy Tiffy, and the mix of flavors and freshness of the sandwiches are top notch. Arguably best in SF.Service: 5/5 - Super busy at most times of the day, but it's a very efficient process. Also, given that you can call in advance, I think that makes up for the fact that there is typically a long wait. Ambiance: N/A - You can't eat-in here, and it's not that type of joint.Value: 4/5 - Sandwiches are definitely more costly than you would pay in most other places, with most being ~$10, some even more than that. But given the size and the fact that these are arguably the best in SF, it's worth it.
Ok let me start off by saying that the long lines were out the door and the reviews were great so I decided to go check it out. After waiting for about an hour and 20 minutes to get my sandwich I was very disappointed. It was okay but nothing out of ordinary my husband said subway is better so here it is go check it out for yourself but I don't recommend.
This bread is what dreams are made of. Seriously, the dutch crunch is amazing! And the sandwiches are monstrous! They do it big here, folks!! You can share a sammich, but who would want to do that? Spiffy Tiffy was good, but I would do it w/o the mushrooms next time. I expected it to be better.  The Lincecum was AMAZING! The clear winner here. Maybe I underestimated it, but damn, it was good. Me and hubby were fighting over it...lol. Love it. And the Ginger Ale drink here is OFF THE HOOK. Ginger bits and cane sugar - oh so refreshing and tasty. Obsessed! I can see why it's hyped and I have no problem adding to it. Super Fan of this place! Go during off hours and you will be a happy camper!
Great food I totally dig coming here when I am in the city. All the subs are worth a try. Not to count the workers are friendly as well
I had there honey bbq sandwich and it was delicious. Sort of messy but seriously? If the sandwich is good then nothing should bother you. There are so many choices and ingredients to choose from and it really is a SF Institution.
Mmmmm, Ike's.I had the Lincecum (that's my boothang) that has ham, turkey, baconnnnnn, and avocado on whole wheat bread with jalapenos, lettuce and tomatoes. The boyfriend got the Jim Burn. I don't remember what was in it but he asked the cashier what he recommends and that was it. My boyfriend didn't like anything that was on the menu and I did notice that they took off a lot of things, so if anything, I suggest you go on their site and look at their entire list before you plan on going here.Our entire meal was $30. We got 2 Stewart's Key Lime's as well. I like that they come with chips and a caramel apple lollipop, hehe. The cashier recommended the new flavored chips that is Funky Fusion which tastes like BBQ chips to me.I love how they wear Giants themed Ike's Place shirts. Nice touch.
Never has a better sandwich crossed my lips. AMAZING. Here's the trick: These are solid sandwiches on their own. But to really set them apart and launch them in to orbit, YOU MUST ADD FRIED GOODNESS. Choose from onion rings, mozzarella sticks, or my fav, jalapeo poppers.
So tried this place for the first time yesterday and I'll admit it was pretty good!I sat down next to this lady and her segway and ate my sandwich while she was raving about how good this place was and how she's never seen anyone disappointed with their sandwiches...made me lol, I told her I loved the sandwich in fear that she might freak out or something...lolI had the matt cain & I can't say its the best i've ever had, but it was good...the sauce in the sandwich kinda threw me off, but I'll definitely come back again to try something else!
Wow, this place makes amazing sandwiches! Some of the ingredients on the menu might look strange, like you wouldn't think honey would belong in a sandwich, but somehow they make it all work together! So don't be afraid to be adventurous. At first you might think "That's really expensive for a sandwich!" But this isn't Subway. Sure, you could go there and get a whole foot long for $5, but keep in mind you are paying for the quality, not the quantity. Besides, the size of their sandwiches are generous anyway.The only reason for the -1 star is because they only offer chips with your sandwich, other sandwich shops often give an option for a side of fries or mashed potatoes, or even cole slaw. My friend and I ordered the "fried zucchini" on the menu thinking it would come on the side, like an order of fries, but they put it in our sandwich! That was mostly our mistake, but I wish they offered other specialties besides relying solely on their sandwiches. Their drinks and chips are provided by outside sources. I think it'd be cool if they created more recipes for their menu that were just as tasty as their sandwiches.
Does this place need more reviews? Finger licking-licious sandwiches. My fav is manage a troi, sweet and savory and dripping and messy. Yum!
Beautiful city to visit in July due to fog and nice weather/view
Since Ike named a sammie after Timmy (i.e. the Lincecum), I frequent this place. Before Ike, I did not know a sandwich could taste this amazeballs. After all, a sandwich is merely bread and meat! I am not the only person who thinks Ike's is amazeballs as evident by the 30 min line that goes out the door and around the store front. However, I never wait in line for my sandwiches because I have some super secret connection. Jk. I phone in my orders and they are always ready when I get there.
Ike's Place is somewhere that I could go and eat daily and NOT get tired of it. I'm sure you could too. I have so many good things to say about this place I don't even know where to start. First off, location is good. Parking isn't too bad because there are so many near streets to park, even if you are a few blocks away. (walk off those pre-sandwich calories!) I have been here a handful of times and I have NEVER been disappointed after trying a sandwich. These are the beauties I have tried: Tom Brady: My absolute favorite that I have ordered twiceLove Triangle: Delicious, sweet and I will get again. Wario: Tasty, but I have to be in the mood for marinara & meatballs. Sometimes I am a vegetarian: All veggies and tasty!Those are the ones I have tried that are delicious and addictive. What I love even more about those sandwiches? They are all vegetarian and/or vegan! Ike's Place has a ton of choices to chose from, and I love that they make vegan and vegetarian sandwiches. Being a vegetarian for 4 years, its nice to know that I don't have to give up sandwiches. As for the pricing, I'm not gonna lie they are a bit expensive, but I don't mind if my bank account gets low, IKE'S IS TOTALLY WORTH IT. If I lived closer...I would be fat, broke and addicted. Which is okay, but I'll let that happen later down the road..
After seeing numerous friends raving about Ike's, I finally got the opportunity to check this place out.When we arrived, there wasn't much of a line so I was relieved. We eyed the menu but it was hard to decide what to get. There were a few dozen choices and all the sandwiches either had pastrami, salami, ham, turkey, chicken, steak, BACON, roost beef, meatballs, mozzarella sticks, stuffed jalapenos -- so how can one man decide!?My girl and I finally decided and shared the "Menage A Trois" and the "Lincecum" [Go Giants] which were both were delicious. [s3-media2.px.yelpcdn.comThis was my first time trying halal chicken (off the Menage) and the Lincecum was also packed with bacon and avocado; two ingredients that can make any sandwich twice as good. Both sandwiches were very messy (their "dirty" sauce gets you pretty messy in the process) and also came with a bag of "dirty" potato chips and a blow pop for dessert (I haven't seen one of these since elementary).Overall, the sandwiches are legit. I can't wait to try the gut-busting side of the menu: Doomsday, Kryptonite, Lex, etc. However, the sandwiches ARE expensive ranging from $10-$20.
Yum, yum, YUM!! I think I've died and gone to sandwich heaven.My personal favorite is We're JUST Friends on Dutch Crunch bread: halal chicken, sweet orange glaze, avocados, and pepper jack. Mmmmmmm... excuse the drool; my mouth is watering just from typing that up. Each sandwich also comes with a bag of chips for you to snack on while you wait for your sandwich masterpiece to be handed to you. You'll probably go into a heavy food coma after ingesting their huge sandwiches, but... hey, if that's what it takes to get Ike's into my system, so be it.But wait, there's more! There's a caramel apple pop in the paper bag that my sandwich comes in?! I haven't seen those since elementary school!! Even more brownie points for them.Avoid peak lunch hours if you want to avoid the huge lines. Or call in your order :)
Ike's Place has delicious sandwiches, but can be on the pricey side (~$10/sandwich) . I had the Matt Cain on Dutch crunch, which was a roast beef, turkey, and salami sandwich with cheesy Godfather sauce: delicious and one-of-a-kind. The sandwich also came with a bag of chips of my choosing (there were a LOT of chips to choose from) and their chips actually had flavor unlike the typical Lay's or Cheetos.I would probably be a regular if I lived near Mission St.
Great expensive burgers. I can understand the quality but why the hell it is so expensive. I can almost get the same quality burger at in n out.
Other than the hassle factor of Ike's- IT IS THE BEST SANDWICH IN TOWN- the lines/parking/phone answering hassles are why they lose a star...
Ordinarily when a place already has 3,463 reviews I don't even bother to write one myself. However, this place legitimately rocks and deserves as many 5 star reviews that it can handle. My friends and I all wanted to try this place based on things we have heard from friends. When I checked out their website I realized this was the place I had seen on Man vs. Food and had been wanting to try. They had so many options on their menu I couldn't make up my mind on what the hell I was going to order once we got there. Turning the corner onto 16th from Church I could already see a group formed outside of a building and knew right away that we had successfully arrived at our destination. With tummy growling I was nervous that it would be dinnertime by the time I received my lunch due to the long line. However we only waited about 10-15 min in line, which in this reviewers opinion was very quick for such a popular place. I ordered the Hot Momma Huda which was $8.98. The sandwich comes with a bag of chips and one of those caramel apple suckers which I thought was a cute little ad-on. Drinks are sold separately . There are no tables or chairs in the entire restaurant, I'm assuming this is due to the large number of customers they receive in a day. They do have a long bench that you can wait on or do as my group and many others were doing and stand and wait outside. I believe we only waited about 10 additional minutes for our orders then walked a couple blocks down to Dolores Park to devour our sandwiches. I devoured the best sandwich of my life at that park and would do a ridiculous amount of the crudest things to have another sandwich from Ike's right now. I'M SERIOUS! Damn Delicious Sandwich!! Definitely a place to go when in San Francisco!
I like the idea of Ike's but paying $15+ per sandwich is not OK with me. Now that Mr. Pickles SF has upgraded options with gluten-free and veg, I will be going there instead. I don't like to wait forever, I don't like the price and I don't like the location. Also I don't like your crappy phone app, upgrade it already so we can customize better!
Best sandwiches ever, #9 is perfect! Miss this place since I moved to SoCal :(
Everything that can become addicting will have the term crack in the title LOL. These sammies are beyond crackolicious and im so happy that I watch enough T.V. to discover some of these spots LOL. So of course I see it on Man vs. Food and I must try NAO!   Since I partied to hard the night before, this was my brunch haha. I really wanted to strive for breakfast and lunch but that didn't happen and thats ok because I ate both halves of that beast , took some time but I couldn't let a once in a lifetime Ike's place sammie go to waste hehe.   So came up to the cashier and she was so nice I mean really nice and not in some kind of overly nice way. She was awesome!!! And we love that Mate colada spritzer. So scaling the menu makes you want just about everything and I love love loooove the names of some of the sammies. Finally I settled on the Hollywood S.F. philly cheesesteak and PIC ordered the Spiffy tiffy. I love the selection of chips as well.  There are noooooo tables you either stand out side and eat or you try to snag a seat on the bench or one of the three chairs and me being the eagle that I am, I swooped in and stole two spots on the bench fast!  Now for the taste man oh man! This was the best sammie I ever had. I had it on the dutch crunch and kept it the way it was but I kinda wish I added the jalapeno poppers, that would go great with any cheesesteak. My sammie was with provolone, mushrooms, shaved ribeye and duuuuuuuurty sauce. First bite was instant mouthgasm. PIC sandwich was with halal chicken, lettuce,tomato,guacamole, mushrooms and some sort of pesto sauce. That was great as well. So fresh I mean uber fresh, all ingredients.  I LOVE this place and please please please open one in SoCal!!!! I want to scale that menu!!!!
I thought Little Lucca's was the best sandwich spot in town until I ate here. As I got there, there were people chilling outside waiting for their sandwiches. The line was empty but as people came in, I let them order first since I wasn't sure what I was going to order. My friend recommended the Menage a Trios and MAN it was ORGASMIC! HANDS DOWN THE BEST SANDWICH I'VE EVER HAD! I will definitely be back when I'm not on a budget :P The sandwich and a bag of chips ran me ~$13 which is more on the expensive side but definitely worth it.Service here was fast considering how many customers there are. Front end staff were extremely friendly and even recommended what sandwiches to get/are the most popular.***Parking***: Somewhat hard to find. It's in the castro area so parking is typically harder to find.***QUICK TIP***: Look for their menu online. They have over 100 sandwiches. Cash/Credit/Debit are all accepted here.
I went to Ike's on a recent trip up to San Francisco because a friend/co-worker told me that I had to make the trip out to Castro for these sandwiches. She was right, these sandwiches are delicious and they have so many choices. It took me a while to make my decision. Ike's definitely stands out on the street with the brightly colored store front and huge crowd standing outside the shop, since there are only about three tables total. I was lucky to share a table with two other people.I got the Hollywood's SF Cheesesteak, yelp.com/biz_photos/dold which was excellent. It had rib-eye steak, mushrooms, and provolone cheese. I got it with everything because I didn't want to lose out on any of the goodness. The dirty sauce was great like all the reviews say. I regretted not sharing my sandwich because one half was enough for my lunch. I ended up packing the other half and eating it later in Golden Gate Park as a snack before going to the CA Academy of Sciences... where I got the sauce on my cardigan (that's what she said), but it's all good.When you are at Ike's just be prepared for a wait. I think we waited about 20 minutes for our two sandwiches to be made. I almost finished my lemonade before the sandwiches got there. The caramel apple pop that they give with their sandwiches made up for that.I wish I were up in San Francisco longer so I could try more of their sandwiches! I would say that Ike's Place is similar to Pink's Hotdogs in Los Angeles because of the choices and the creative names such as [Name of Girl I'm Dating] and M.I.L.F. I will definitely be visiting Ike's next time I come back. I give Ike's a solid 4.5 stars. -0.5 for the wait time and seating.
duh!I pretty much go to Ike's when I'm not near Sam's Sandwiches in Burlingame and vice versa. Hollywood's SF Cheesesteak please...even though I think it's understood that everything is amazing here.
This is one of the places that you MUST visit when coming to San Francisco!!! I cannot think of another place where you can find these sandwiches at. They all have a unique taste to it thats worth every bite! It was also a messy meal!! So be ready to have plenty of napkins and wet wipes!! All the sandwiches comes in a paper bag with a bag of chips and caramel apple lollipop.. I feel like i'm in grade school again! :]The parking was difficult to find. We parked down the block and had to walk a distance. (and it was gay pride week, so we watched the men in our group run to Ike's for shelter!! hahahah)
They served up some pretty solid sandwiches with awesome names like nacho boys and menage a trois. Must get the Dutch crunch with their signature sauce. The sandwiches are a bit on the pricey side but it's worth your hard earn money. I got the nacho boys with roast beef, Swiss, avocado, lettuce tomatoes served on warm toasty bread. They even hook you up with a bag of dirty chips! This place is a winner for me :)*Qucik tip* hard to find parking so make sure you bring a buddy to watch the car while you go order.
ok service. bathroom is dirty and the sandwiches were boring and stale. not worth the wait! 1 star for service and one for the lolly pop in the sandwich
I got the super luigi which consisted of stuffed jalapeno filled with cream cheese. I ate cream cheese heaven for lunch.The service here was awful though. They were really rude and looked extremely impatient. The female cashier was even leaning over the register and had her head resting on her hand to show how bored and tired she was. A $10 sandwich may seem like a ripoff, but half way through, you realize now you have something for dinner.
This place is full of mouth-watering delicious sandwiches to stuff your face with. My husband had the Pilgrim and was in heaven when he realized there was an awesome mix of cranberry sauce and sriracha. Seriously, who thinks of this awesomeness? My sandwich of choice was the Matt Cain which was loaded with several meats and topped with Godfather sauce. Ike's has no shortage of imaginative sandwich creations (and creative names too!). We can't wait to go back and try more!
Love this place!! Great Sammies
Every sandwich I've had from here has been amazing! My favorite is the Al Bundy on dutch crunch. The line is always out the door and down the sidewalk, so expect to wait at least 45 minutes. But if you aren't in a hurry, it's definitely worth the wait!
Over 3,300 reviews, wow! How can you resist not trying this place. The menu is HUGE, so many options and everything sounds delicious (it taste even better!) I got the Lincecum on a wonderful Dutch Crunch. The havarti cheese was melted and the veggies fresh. So many sauces available too, but the most famous of them all - dirty sauce, is amazing! All sandwiches come with dirty chips (the Funky Fusion flavor was good, tangy and sweet at the same time) and a lollipop.There is really no place inside to sit down and eat but Dolores park is only a couple of blocks away. Or there is a beautiful middle school located nearby, it's steps very inviting. A perfect place to people watch. Can't wait to come back and try more of their wonderful sandwiches. The veggie fries looked really good, I'll have to try them next time.
Rate the food a solid 4.5/5.I've heard about Ike's for some 3 years now, but didn't get to try it until my trip back to the bay area this past december. My boyfriend came up to visit NorCal for the first time and I wanted to take him to some of SF's greatest, most popular places, so naturally, Ike's was a MUST on our list of things to do/eat. We took the BART (another first for him) and walked a good 15 minutes to the Castro location. I was afraid there might be some CRAZY line, because I've heard stories, but luckily, there were only 3 or 4 other customers there at 11:30 on a Saturday afternoon. We ordered our sandwiches, a Matt Cain and a Menage a Trois, both on dutch crunch and were super excited upon receiving them in a short time. Foolishly, we thought we'd go enjoy our sandwiches at Phil'z along with some tasty Mint Mojito iced coffee, but we later learned that place was very popular with few seats. Eventually we settled at a nearby park and finally got to eating and OMG, these sandwiches were sooooooo tasty. That dirty sauce....don't know whats in it, but its gooood. The Matt Cain was really good too, but the Menage a Trois has all these flavors working together to just fill your tastebuds with happiness. I ate half my sandwich savoring every bite, and ate the other half the next day (it was still friggen good a day later.) Both boyfriend and I were super content and happy as we enjoyed a sunny SF afternoon (bc to be honest, thats pretty rare in itself) sipping on delicious coffee and munching on awesome sandwiches. Is it overrated? Maybe? It's not like I'd die if I couldn't eat it ever again, but it IS pretty damn delicious and definitely worth trying
Salaam.....love your sandwiches and saw that you had a lovely love story with your new missus... !
Great sandwiches. But, definitely more of a hey look at all the stuff we can put on our sandwiches, instead of the quality of the meats and menu
Really good sandwiches! Had a Menage a Trois and the Damon Bruce. Possibly the best sandwich I've ever had!
I saw Ike's on Man vs. Food and bookmarked immediately, came down from L.A. just to try! They have so many sandwiches to choose from it could take a while to order because everything on the menu looks good. The guy at the register was cool, asked me what I liked and put something together that I will NEVER forget. Only recommendation, the vessel of choice has to be that nut crunch bread, try the "dirty sauce!" The guys at the shop mentioned to watch out for Ike's, its coming to Los Angeles soon!!
Long story short: Finally got to try this place!! Really big but really good sandwiches!!Long story long:Continuation of my friend's bachelor party weekend. I recommended this place for lunch the 2nd day we were in town. I had seen this place on Food Network and Man v. Food, and the sandwiches looked and sounded really good.Apparently this place had moved locations from the first time I tried going. First time around, I was too early. I could have possibly come back later, but considering I was on foot and I had a particular plan with my food tour that day, I opted not to wait. But I was glad I was able to get to it this time around.This new location is definitely bigger than the old location was. We got in line and looked over the menu. I eventually decided on the "Spiffy Tiffy": halal chicken, sauteed mushrooms, their famous Godfather sauce, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, and pesto on Dutch Crunch bread. A few minutes later, our freshly made sandwiches were ready and we ate on the spot, grabbing spots on the bench/window sill. My sandwich was GOOD. Everything was fresh and I don't know if it was supposed to be that way, but the chicken was a little dry, but still really flavorful.All of the other guys liked their sandwiches as well. I cannot wait to come back here.
You want a good sandwich..... you gotto go to the Ike's...best sandwiches ever... at best price ever....This place was recommended to me by my friend in college, which was like 3 years back and since then, this has been my favorite place for snacking....The place has got some wonderful combos that you can try, if you're there with your group of friends..My fav combos:Everett middle school:$9.99Blind date: $11.11
This place was pretty good. I was disappointed because im so in love with little luccas and their portions are double the size for the same price. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to go to this place again, only if I was in the area
I love Ike's! I will go out of my way to come here to get their huge sandwiches. I normally get their nacho boy. I've tried their Hollywood SF. They are both scrumptious! Don't care for their chips...I'm just not a fan of kettle chips. Been to Ike's Lair as well...a little hard to find. Love their dutch crunch! This is my new place to get sandwiches. I use to get them at Roxie's, but it's all about Ike's now.
This place really lives up to its reviews. I love the fact that their sandwiches are creative. My husband ended up eating half my mnage a trois. I felt robbed ;( definitely will return!!
Had the sandwich to go, and it was still great when I got it home! Amazing place
Had to try this place because of the rave reviews during my trip to SF. Expected it to be busier at lunchtime on a weekday; I almost thought I was in the wrong place because I was the only one there.I ordered both the Cain and the Lincecum. $10 for a sandwich was surprising but I guarantee you'll forget about the price when you take the first bite. The Dutch Crunch bread is amazing; the ingredients are fresh, high-quality, and absolutely delicious. As a bonus it's oven-warmed, so this isn't your garden-variety deli. Ike's Place lives up to all the hype and is really a San Francisco gem.
great service, good sandwich....no place to sit....I hate these places that can't invest in some tables...I find these hipster joints have customers that love standing in line, swiping their smartphones and getting it to go....I need a table. Not a park bench 3 blocks away. How about some table seating outside? nothing fancy..a used pic nic bench?....just a fucking table please.
The Matt Cain is one of my all time favorite sandwiches.Built with fresh ingredients,great dutch crunch roll and the amazing sauces you can get on them.I use the app and order ahead of time ...no waiting in line !!
Been meaning to come here for a while based on the # of reviews and Man Vs. Food, so was excited. However, this sandwich epitomizes the over creativity of the neo San Franciscan cooking. I had the Menage A Trois (BBQ, Cheddar, Halal Chicken, Honey Mustard, Pepper Jack, Real Honey, Swiss) on dutch crunch and extra dirty sauce. Before knowing that the dutch crunch is actually available at many delis in SF, I was giving them props for such great bread. Don't get me wrong, the sandwich was tasty but not sure what "dirty sauce" tastes like or why it's necessary on every sandwich. The bbq sauce and honey mustard completely overpowered what the "dirty sauce" may have tasted. Honestly, the sandwich was a 3.5 ($12 kind of steep for that quality of a sandwich) but the friendly and accommodating staff (they cut and wrapped our shared sandwich individually without us asking) pushed it to a respectable 4.
I don't really get where the hype comes from. i honestly think the sandwich here are Okay, not outstanding or the best. i would usually order matt cain and change, i just think it taste okay. customer service is great, staff are friendly, attentive service, i'm probably giving this place a 3 star becuse i'm not too crazy about a sandwich drenched with sauce, i think the price is a bit overpriced, and they just shove in too much stuff in sandwich so the bread gets sogged up, which i don't like.this is just a personal opinion, i still get my sandwich here once in a while when i'm craving.
Absolutely AMAZING. My boyfriend and I shared a threesome and the Paul Reuben--both delicious. What's in their sauce?! As a big fan of bbq sauce and all things bbq, I liked the Menage a trois more, while the bf prefered the Paul Reuben. It was a really close call though! Also, by the time we got there around 4 on Sunday afternoon, they had run out of dutch crunch. Bah! We opted for the french bread instead, which was still totally delicious. We do wonder what the sandwiches would've been like with the dutch crunch though.Anyway, they were pricey, but worth it! I also thought the sandwiches were kind of salty, I ended up dying of thirst. STILL, I cannot wait to go back to SF so I can get another.
Found myself nearby and found parking space directly across Ike's (whoa!)There was no massive line running outside the door (double whoa!!)Walked in, did not have to wait too long (triple whoa!!!)In fact, just 14 minutes to order, wait & get the ultimate prize!The biggest WHOA... The Jaymee Sirewich!  Just like the person, it is glorious and awesome. A wonderful combination of fried chicken, Ike's yellow bbq, pepper jack and ranch with choice of bread (went sourdough roll). While waiting(small space but cool pictures & merchandise on the wall to keep occupied) you could see the workers via open doors putting together the sandwiches and browse the menu board behind the ordering stations to see what other sandwiches to order (next time : )Upon receipt, it was cool to see the Sirewich PLUS a carmel apple pop in my bag(Yeah!) Nice to see they tossed in plenty of napkins because it was a BIG sandwich! In the end, this was a satisfied consumption of a work of art.Thank you Ike, may your staff/crew keep on creating wonderful sandwiches!
So many sandwiches to chose from ! My favorite is the Matt Cain
After reading some of the reviews, I think my bf and I came at a great time. There was no wait when we ordered and sandwiches came out fast! Lucky us :)Boyfriend and I split the [Name of Girl I'm Dating] and Menage Trois. We've been craving halal chicken since we had some in NYC 2 years ago. Sandwiches were very delicious. He loved the Menage Trois more because it "has more flavor" but I'm not a big fan of BBQ, so i enjoyed the other. Loved the chip selection.Down side is no eating area to enjoy our sandwiches. Good thing there's a park nearby. We ended up driving to Golden Gate Park and had our lunch there... even better I guess :)
Yay for no more crazy lines and less than a 5 min wait for my samich! Change. Change is good... real good! Rib-eye, BBQ sauce, onion rings and cheddar on dutch. Change is damn good! Again, I am a sucker for anything with BBQ sauce and this definitely hit the spot! I don't care what anybody says, everyone should have a Menage a Trois at least once in their lifetime! ;) Chicken, honey mustard, AND BBQ sauce with three cheeses...No on that Menage A Trois? Then do Matt Cain! ;) Roast beef, turkey, salami, sub the God father sauce with Dirty Sauce on dutch. Pretty satisfying but I may just have to try it with the God father sauce. I have only one complaint! I always, always forget to eat my chips when I have an Ike's sandwich in front of me... it's that good! Dirty Chips anyone?
We went to Ike's this past saturday. I've heard soo many good things about this place and had to come try it. What I ordered:Spiffy Tiffy: Chicken, Pesto, mushrooms, provolone, pepper jack and avocado on dutch crunch. AMAZING!!! One of the best sandwiches I've ever had.... EVER.. I'm not usually a sandwich person but this one had be smiling at each bite!Other people I was with ordered these:1. Nacho Boy2. The Damon BruceI had a bite of them both and they did not disappoint! Each sandwich comes with a bag of chips. Its a small shop with no tables so I suggest you take your sandwich half a mile down the road, and set yourself up a little picnic and enjoy Dolores Park! :)The people that work there are really nice too! really.. 2 thumbs up to this place. :)I heard you can get a VIP card and skip the line, and or call in for a phone order. We haven't done this yet though. Will be coming back soon! :)
Mozzarella sticks in your sandwich = genius!
Great sandwiches! I had the manage a troi and it was amazing. There're no tables inside so either take out or eat sitting on one of the few seats/bench inside. Don't be turned off by the lack of restaurant feel this place is really tasty and worth trying.
PROS:-Great great great sandwiches!-Large portions. Eat half for lunch, and half for dinner-Has a person asking trivia questions and gives away free stuff while you wait in line!!!CONS:-Long, long, long long LONG line!-Small, crowded, and cramped-Nowhere to eat! And since it's so popular, everyone's super crazy about not eating on their property, so you may need to walk all the way to Dolores park to eat your grubOverall, I think this is a great place, but it definitely took us a good 45 minutes to order and receive our food. Not their fault, the food is amazing, but if you're hungry and in a rush, you should go someplace else.
There's always a long line here, but for a good reason. The sandwiches are juicy and delicious. My go-to is the Jaymee Sirewich sandwich, which is posted on one of the columns. It's a bit strange to have to explore the menu that is posted all over the walls and perhaps even more online, but there is certainly a sandwich for anyone here. I also always look forward to the caramel apple lollipop treat!Cons are the wait time and the lack of seating, though it might be faster if you ordered online through the Facebook app or just took things to go.
YUM-O. Best sandwich place I have ever been to. With places such as Ike's that receive so much hype, I usually am a little bit disappointed because my expectations become significantly higher. However, this place definitely lived up to its hype!My friend from out of town came up to visit, so where else would I take him except to one of the more famous eateries in San Francisco? Besides, I had never been there myself and why not try it? The line was not bad at all; I heard the line is usually out the door, but my friend and I went on a weekday during my lunch break. While we were able to order within 7 minutes, receiving our food took a lot longer--twelve minutes or so. While I was on a bit of a time crunch, I did not really mind the wait; it was a lovely day and the chips that they give you along with your meal made the time go by faster (I by the way, got the salt and vinegar chips--my favorite. These chips were extra crunchy and salty--exactly how I like them!). I believe that they have up to a 1000 different types of sandwiches. The sandwiches listed on the board had numbers from 1 to 1000, and these were only the most popular options. I ordered the backstabber, which included halal chicken, marinated artichokes, veggies, caesar, provolone, and pickles on sourdough bread. Of course, dirty sauce was included. There were too many that looked delicious, but this was also featured on Man vs. Food, and The Best Thing I Have Ever Tasted on the Food Network, so I HAD to get it. Taking the first bite, I was immediately introduced to a variety of flavors--the chicken, sauces, all blended together so well. No one thing overpowered the other, and it was just...delicious. Indescribably delicious. It was also a REAL sandwich--you get a little messy eating your sandwich; the sauce drips a little bit and the chicken does fall out a bit. In my opinion though, that is exactly how a sandwich should be. The meal also came up with a caramel apple lollipop, but I'm not a big fan of lollipops. There are however, a few things that I wasn't a terribly big fan of: 1. While their are sandwiches are generously proportioned (I was full after half), I still think it is relatively expensive. The sandwiches range anywhere from $8-$13; my sandwich was a bit more on the pricier side, which I guess is why I thought it was a little pricey for a sandwich. 2. There isn't anywhere to sit. There is supposedly a park nearby, but my friend and I were unable to find it. We just sat on the steps in front of an apartment building and surprisingly, I really liked it; it made lunch so much more casual and comfortable, and as cheesy as it sounds, I did kind of feel that I was in a movie, with not a care in the world, just eating a delicious meal with a wonderful friend in one of the greatest cities in the world. I will definitely come back and try another sandwich! Next time, i will definitely buy the Leninnade because as a History major, who wouldn't appreciate that?
I am not a big sandwich fan. Even when I tried earl's sandwich, I was not impressed. However, I was absolutely blown away by this place! I tried the menage a trois with dutch crunch bread(which is a must). The crunchiness of the bread made the sandwich a whole another level. I love how they use halal chicken in sandwiches, I haven't seen that anywhere else. Please stop by if you are ever in SF!
Yes it took me this long to try Ike's. Let me preface by saying that I'm a simple guy when it comes to sandwiches.Ike's is good, don't get me wrong, but for me there's too much going on. I tried the Tony Soprano and the Jessica Rabbit. While tasty, after a few bites it felt really heavy (more so with the latter). Also I like the bread toasted for a textural contrast. Their dutch crunch is better than most though.I'd maybe come back and order it without all the sauces. But then it wouldn't be an Ike's sandwich right?
Expensive sandwhiches but definitley worth it. Very hearty.
First time here was at the one in SF location. I got the Jim Rome, dutch crunch bread recommended to me by the cashier and from then again it has become my usual order. I also tried the Going Home For Thanksgiving, it was good, the cranberry sauce gives it that sweet taste each time you bite into it. The cashier I had was very friendly and glad he suggested me to choose dutch crunch for the bread because it really is good. I`ve also been in SFSU Ike`s and its also pretty good. I like that you can call and order what you want then just pick it up. Aside from my usual, I also tried the Lincecum, which is pretty good. But I think for now my favorite would be the Jim Rome.
I got excited by a sandwich! They have incredible bread. And then the combination of the meats and the sauce just work out.
Nice variety of sandwiches and they come big. They got to curb the menu a little as it's a little too overbearing. Just stay away from the halal chicken sandwich. That thing was so overpowering that it turned my sandwich into some corner chicken and rice crap.
Um one word. AMAZING!!! Went to San Francisco for a day trip cause we were visiting our friend from Davis and decided to stop by this little gem. Now I truly understand the hype. Ordered the menage a trois with dutch crunch bread. Its a must try! Plus everyone is really nice. This place is nestled in between 2 shops and it's easy to miss if you haven't been there before so keep your eyes wide open. There was a bit of a wait when we got there. And at first I didn't understand why a sandwich place would be so crowded but once I took a bite I knew I was in heaven. I highly recommend this place to everyone who is visiting the Bay Area or even the locals. Sad to say this is a Bay Area gem and I can't seem to find a comparison down here in Southern California. PLEASE OPEN ONE IN LA!
Great unique flavors. But you might as well put it all in a blender and drink it with a straw. The bread was super soggy with the amount of sauces they put on. Super messy, a lot of the sauce just ran down my arms.
With all the hype about this place, I have to go try it. In my opinion, this place is good, but not the "best" like everyone makes it seem. The "best" in my opinion is either Submarine Center in West Portal or Capriotti's in Wilmington, DE.If you could think of Pink's hot dog being a sandwich place, this place is exactly it. The breads are slightly above average and are toasted right before you order them. Then they "glamorize" it with all these extravagant toppings and some are over board (ie. the lex luthor which basically has 7 types of meat which I think is a little much).I tried the Menage-A-Trois, Shawn Michael, and Super Luigi all were good and my favorite was the Shawn Michael. The line and wait here can get insane no matter what time or when you come so I highly recommend calling in advance about an hour before you would want to get your sandwiches.Overall, good but not the best but worth trying.
The best sandwich and chip selection ever. Had the Stephan Jenkins. Wanted to save half for dinner... woops :(.Order ahead.
Best sandwiches I have ever had! Menage a trois... must try! Words can't even describe how good that sandwich is.
Really expensive. Tasty. Efficient service, but it's still sandwiches. Calm down, everyone.
Love the different variety of sandwiches! Have been to the one in Oakland twice, I enjoyed both times. I am not a super meaty gal, so a little over kill on the meat, I like equal proportions in my sandwiches, but that is personal taste. So for my meat lovers I will recommend highly. Haven't tried any vegetarian options but that might be on my to do list next time I am in. Yummy and quick!
Solid 4. Overwhelming menu! Check out their website to see their interactive menu, fun! While Menage a trois seems to be the winner - and while tasty, I was a bigger fan of the Spiffy Tiffy. If you like pesto and chicken, this is where it's at. And put it on the dutch crunch! Pretty much the best dutch crunch bread I've had. To be honest, I wouldn't come all the way out to the city from SM for a sandwich, but I'd definitely pick one up if I was in the area. Also nice that your sandwich comes with a bag of chips and a caramel apple lollipop. Huge note that I did not know before I came was that there are no tables! Easy enough to take a (long) stroll down to Dolores Park and eat there or make it part of a picnic lunch.
Probably one of my favorite sandwich places in all of the Bay Area. When you walk in, the place looks very humble. Not alot of decor, but definitely some good sandwiches. Most days, the owner will be there too. The first time I tried it, I was so impressed that I even got an extra one to go! I initially tried the Matt Cain. Imagine mounds of tender roast beef, turkey, and salami smashed in between two slices of fresh, sweet wheat bread smothered in godfather sauce (tastes like a concoction of spicy mustard, ranch, and onion goodness) and provolone cheese. Get the picture? Well, pretty much ALL their sandwiches fit the description, just change the meat. They all come stacked with lettuce, tomato, banana peppers, and jalapenos. I usually request more godfather sauce because it just tastes so damn good! I also had the opportunity to try the menage-a-trois, as well as the hollywood SF cheesesteak. Each sandwich has a unique flavor and twist to it. I will definitely try more new things here, since all three of my sandwiches were absolutely delicious, I can only assume the rest are as well.PROTIP: TRY THE JALAPENO CHIPS NOW.
There are sandwiches. There are great sandwiches. Then there are Ike's sandwiches.Ike's is an experience you will never forget. The stupidly long menu will make you squirm in your place, biting your lower lip in a haze of choices. But don't worry. It's okay. Whatever you get here will make you oooh, ahhh- and omfg way after the sandwich is over.At Ike's, you'll discover tastes you didn't know bread could contain, and culinary masterminds push the boundaries of flavor pairings. Onion rings and jalepeno poppers? Sure. Sriracha sauce on your turkey? No problem. Tuna and avocado with American cheese, beer battered zucchini, mozzarella sticks...anything you can dream up, Ike's probably makes a version of it - or will, if you ask.I recommend the Paul Reubens (pastrami, homemade poppy seed coleslaw, french dressing, swiss) and the Jessica Rabbit (vegan breaded chicken, stuffed jalapeno poppers, franks red hot, ranch). It's worth the line. It's worth the wait. It's worth whatever years of existence it took you to try this place.
One word- YUMMY- period
I think i almost had a heart attack trying to finish the sandwich but I love it!
My favorite place to have a sandwhich!! They are opening up a location in Westwood!I love the Holy Name Panthers which is very saucy with dirty sauce, marinara, and ranch..... anything with the dirty sauce will taste amazing!
Love this place, but the carbs will kill you
The best place to get a sandwich! Friendly staff, great service, and good food. The dutch crunch bread is a must! The price is decent but definitely worth it for the sandwich.
What's the hype? I got the Damon Bruce (thinly sliced rib eye, steak sauce, beer battered onion rings, provolone) and my friend made her own. I was really excited to try these sandwiches... but in the end:1. Two sandwiches and drinks cost us $30.2. The bread was quite good but the ratio of bread to meat to iceberg lettuce/slice of tomato was off.3. The dirty sauce and steak sauce were good but made the beer battered onion rings get soggy and wilt.4. The didn't put all of the toppings I requested on the sandwich (and sadly I didn't check until I was out of there).5. On top of that, we waited a half hour for our sandwiches.I'd probably only be back if I wanted to try something off the Superman menu for novelty sake.
I like Ike! Came from out of town. I saw this place on man vs. food. It looked good on TV better in person. I had the "we are just friends" on Dutch crunch stuffed with many fried items ummm ummm b$&ch!!! lol well worth the trip.
I write this review with a heavy heart. In many ways, this is why great expectations are so troublesome. Just like Estella, Ike's promised much and did not deliver. A quick flashback to spotting the new Ike's location on 16th and Sanchez saw a very excited Jeremy. I was in the area near lunchtime and had to both eat and waste minutes. I had been wanting an Ike's sandwich since working at Yelp back in Phoenix. Now was my chance. I went for the Menage a Trois and added in mozzarella sticks (I had to have cheese sticks in my sandwich). I asked for no lettuce and tomatoes. The guy asked me if I wanted them and I said no and he acknowledged this. I had no clue until after my sandwich was already in the food making queue that I could have gotten onions for free. This made me a little sad. I should have digested the novella of a menu more fully. I also purchased a bottle of water. I saw no water possibilities other than this. I eagerly await for my sammy. I munch on my Dirty Chips.  It arrives! I unwrap it! Wait. There is something red inside. That's funny. What sort of prize did I win? I won a tomato. Yes, the same tomato that I did not want. Fine. I pick it out. All four slices. I bite into the sandwich. I am digging the pulled Halal chicken. the bbq and honey mustard have mixed well. I can taste the honey and I like it. Then I get to the cheese. Wasn't fully melted (due to the warmness of the chicken below, this was awkward). The cheese sticks were coated in a limp battering and also were clearly not fresh (my thoughts on the sticks are either that I got lukewarm ones or this is how they are always served, which is perhaps more disappointing). As I drink my water from the water bottle, I see another fellow order and get a cup of water from the girl at the counter. Once more, I wasn't privy to some secret code. Half my fault, of course, for not asking (and since most people take out of here, I can understand the lack of a dedicated system to provide patrons free water.So here's why the 3 stars. Was the sandwich good? Yes, it was. Was it the best sandwich ever? No. Could it have been? Maybe. Also, this whole shebang cost me 16 dollars. More like an 8 to 10 dollar experience. I will be back, but I will be prepared with my own water bottle, will have studied the menu, will request onions, and will avoid the cheese sticks.
I cannot believe it took me this long to review Ike's, when it is literally my favorite place to eat in the entire Bay Area. Probably because it's all been said before: generous portions, the perfect dutch crunch, and THAT DIRTY SAUCE.Parking can be difficult, and it gets super crowded when you're waiting for your sandwich, but you can deal with both these issues by calling ahead.If someone proposes to me with Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian on dutch crunch, with melted mozzarella, extra pickles and banana peppers, 86 the avocado and mayo, and somehow finagles an extra caramel apple pop, I will probably say yes.
Okay so let me start by saying that I have been trying to get an Ike's sandwich for over 5 years! They used to have a small window in the Castro where people would line up from open-close. I have always heard such wonderful things about the creations that come from the window but I have had no time to wait in the line to experience it first hand. Then one day the residents of the Castro revolted and just like that... Ike's was gone. GONE??? My dreams of one day indulging on "Dirty Sauce" were shattered. Fast Forward 5 years to last Monday. I'm in San Jose, hungover, and looking for a cure. I see Ike's, I think to myself "Could this be a storefront holding the keys to the dream I once had? Yes. Yes, it is". I immediately pull over (parking is convenient in San Jose) and walk inside to find no line- NO LINE! The staff was super friendly and answered all of my questions. After much debate, I pick out my sandwich, The Jaymee Sirewich, and I pay for my goods and patiently await my for my fantasy to become a reality. Here is where I get mushy... My sandwich SUCKED. There was not much meat in it and it was so drowned in Ranch that I had to eat it with a fork and a knife. I gave up half way through because I honestly couldn't taste anything but ranch. This made me sad because I felt like I had waited my whole life for that experience and it sucked. Back to the good stuff... Luckily my friend ordered the 49er and he was willing to part with half. This was delicious and I left satisfied. I recommend Ike's but if your sando comes with sauce I suggest asking them to go easy unless you swimming in sauce is your thing.
Great selection of vegetarian and vegan sandwiches. They are super messy but it's worth it! This is probably my favorite sandwich place in the area.
I have one pressing question - how am I ever going to relegate myself to the likes of Subway, Jason's Deli, and nondescript coffee shops' vegetarian (veganized for the likes of me) sandwiches after being Ike's-inized. Okay seriously though, vegan and vegetarian options galore. Like actual specified vegan menu options. None of that "can be made vegan" or "can substitute Boca vegan patty (of which I consume regularly, but it's not even tasty! That's right, I finally admitted it!!)." We settled upon the Vegan Meatless Mike (vegan meatballs, marinara, and soy cheese) with added onions and grilled mushrooms and the Vegan Reuben (vegan breaded chicken, homemade poppy seed coleslaw, French dressing, and soy cheese) with all the free dressings. Except for minus the soy cheese. See my photos . . . Which reminds me - a big "screw you" to the early lunch crowd for depleting the soy cheese. Vegan cheese is rarely an option for me in my hood (Houston, ugh), so I collectively spit on you greedy inconsiderate SF vegan. Just kidding, I'm over it because the sandwiches were FREAKING AMAZING ANYWAY!What kind of black magic is the Dutch Crunch bread rendered from? I despise super dense bread because I feel it often robs the sandwich innards - the unique true stars of all sandwiches, of their limelight. The Dutch Crutch is comparable to lightly crusty and slightly puffy warm dreamy pillows of glory, tenderly cuddling the soppy flavorful chunks of vegan meatball - huge upgrade from vegan Boca patties. My gawd, the vegan meatballs and marinara - I have additional pressing questions! Are the components of the Meatless Mike commercially available? If not, can someone regularly ship me the stuff? I will harvest and send you a billion cowboy hats. I wouldn't say it was an accurate analogue of a non-vegan meatball sub, but if you miss meat after downing the eight girthy inches of cruelty-free glory, you suck. So disgustingly flavorful. I cried when I finally devoured my half. No but seriously, Dutch Crunch it all the way. It's an abomination to you and your ancestors otherwise! I regularly discard one-fourth or half of my sandwich/wrap/burrito carb exteriors. Come to think of it, I actually don't like sandwiches and burgers all that much anyway because of my disproportionate-filling-to-bread ratio phobia. Because again, I hate really overpowering breads that masks the fillings! But I gobbled all the Dutch Crunch bread up with such fervor. Atkins is rolling over in his grave . . . I LOVE these freaking sandwiches!The Vegan Reuben suffered a less honorable fate smeared on super dense sourdough bread. But I expertly waited a few hours before undertaking it, so the drippy sauces had "semi-digested" the bready intensity of the sourdough. I actually don't recommend consuming this or any Ike's creations NOT immediately, but the fact that I still adored this moist vegan breaded chicken concocted with red cabbage and limp formerly fresh veggies - that means a lot, you know? Again, it was supremely tasty and I have to remind myself over and over again to just be lady, take it easy . . . But really, the tender chewiness of the faux meat and sauces all thoroughly seeped through the bread and veggie. As other Yelpers have mentioned - this place is RIDICULOUSLY vegan-conscientious. You get Blow Pops instead of the default caramel apple lollipops if you abstain from the animal kinds consumption. The lovely cashier gal informed us that we had our pick of "Dirty" Potato Chips (one free bag with every sandwich), but to avoid the Salt N Vinegar if we wanted to be "real vegans" about it. Admittedly these $10 and up sandwiches are hardly the $5 bargain footlongs from Subway, but seriously quality wins over quantity here. And if you're not a supreme fatty/have self-control, one densely packed sandwich and bag of chips should suffice for two satisfying meals. I realize this review is coming off as super manic because I'm tickled green about the vegan-centric love and honest-to-gawd-genuine-yumminess of the thoroughly well-planned and executed options. Nonetheless, I completely enamored. And devastated there is no Ike's back at home. Brb, crying into my inferior Boca burger right now . . .
For some strange reason the Yelp app didn't update the address on my bookmark so I had some running around a bit. I asked for Ike's Place, a person referred me to Lime Lounge which is their old location, then I went to a sweet shop the nice clerk there gave me instructions to get there. It was two blocks away and actually right across the street where I parked. I was in the city to meet with a potential client, after the meeting, I opened up the Yelp App and checked for the closest bookmark joint for lunch. So many people were foodspotting Ike's sandwiches that I really wanted to try for myself! Their sandwiches looks absolutely drooling good.I came in not knowing what to order, so I asked the cashier of what was their most popular sandwiches. One from the vegan menu and one from the meat menu. Sorry, I didn't keep a note of what I have ordered. I bought both of my sandwiches home some of the sauce were sogging up my sandwich a tiny bit but no fault of the makers. I then shared it with my siblings. We all agreed that their sandwiches are awesome! Their vegan sandwich doesn't even taste vegan at all because of the imitation chicken that was in it. Each sandwich comes with a bag of chips, that day it was the Dirty Kettle Chips that was being offered. My cashier even noted to me which colored bags of chips where vegan and non-vegan selection. -----+ Pro: Awesome sandwiches!- Con: Small location, possibly difficult to find seating on a busy day.\( ^,^)/ Overall: A huge selection of awesome sandwiches.
Prologue:Y-IKES!After 6 or so mimosa's at Lime and walking out in a foggy haze, somehow I ended up standing in front of Ike's. "IKE'S SANDWICHES". I stared at the sign and after several forced seconds of getting my brain cells to function, I finally remembered that I had wanted to try this place for the longest time. So many glowing reviews on Yelp and they had passed the 1K review mark - it has to be great right?There was a line of course - I believe it took us about 10 minutes to finally get to the front. The ordering part was a bit of a fuzz (the mimosas were starting to sink in), but I got the Paul Reuben. I balked at the fact it cost $10, but at least it came with a bag of chips.Taste test - The sandwich was OK. It had some zesty sauce which was good, but as a whole, the Reuben tasted A-OK. Perhaps I was starting to sober up and lost a bit of my appetite after realizing I just paid $10 (almost $11 w/ tax) for a sandwich. Fast forward a few hours later.....when the mimosas are no longer lingering...these were the thoughts in my head:1. Yuck, I'm never drinking mimosas again.2. Why did I eat a sandwich right after eating at Lime? I feel gross.3. Did I really pay $11 for a sandwich?4. A sandwich is made of cheap-to-make-bread and filling.5. Did I really pay $11 for a sandwich? Wait, I remember they even had sandwiches that were a few dollars more....Y-IKES!Overall, their sandwiches are OK, but overpriced. However, if you can make a decent sandwich, add in some special sauce, slap on a cool name, and sell it in the city, I suppose you can charge whatever you want and still have a line going out the door. Sigh.At least, I get to check Ike's off my food bucket list.
Finally made the quest to Ikes after having it book marked for ages.Time: 12:15PM on a Saturday.Location: 10-15 min. walk from Mission Bart station.Place: Small, crowded with hungry people, no seating for chowing down. Two lines one for pick up on phone orders and the other to place orders. Menu/Food: The board doesn't have all of the sandwich selections I recommend looking at their website for the full menu. It is a little overwhelming so many options. I could not make up my mind until I got there. I went with "we are just friends" on dutch crunch and had onions and jalapeos added. OMG it was huge, messy and fabulous. Good combination, fresh and the bread was soft. Price: I had a coupon for a free sandwich since I signed up to receive emails it was sent for my b-day (score!) on the average they cost $10.00 and come with a bag of chips and a sucker. A little steep but totally worth it.Staff: Super friendly and down to earth. The wait was short compared to what I have read from other reviews. I waited about 15 mins. They were organized and were slanging the orders out pretty fast.Good thing there isn't an Ikes closer to home or I would be fat and broke.
Definitely solid hangover food! I'm a fan of the MILF. Biggest tip: call your order ahead of time. It's hard for me to finish a whole IKE sandwich, so I usually make a day of it. 1/2 for lunch, other 1/2 for dinner. Not the best the day after.
It is silly, just plain SILLY how good Ike's is.I was in San Francisco this week to interview for a job, to chill with some friends, and most importantly, to eat at Ike's.Paul Reubens - pastrami, homemade poppyseed cole slaw, french dressing, swiss cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, peppers on dutch crunch bread. Meat is a passion of mine. If no meat, I no eat. But amazingly, the pastrami is not the main attraction of this sandwich. Ike actually skimps a bit on the pastrami, and there were like four bites near the end that had absolutely no meat. But the homemade slaw, swiss cheese, french dressing, combo of veggies, and of course the dutch crunch bread helped me forget my sorrows. I could've eaten an entire sandwich of just those ingredients. This one is DEFINITELY my favorite (so far).The Joker - all beef meatballs, beer battered zucchinis, Ike's red pesto sauce, ranch, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, peppers on dutch crunch bread. As with any of Ike's sandwiches, the highlight here is the sauce. The meatballs and zucchinis are definitely nice, but it's the combo of Ike's red pesto and ranch sauce that will send your taste buds flying.So far, this is how the sandwiches that I've tried rank:1. Paul Reubens2. The Joker3. Change4. Matt CainIke, mark my words. I will eat every meat sandwich on your menu before I turn 30.
French Fry'z is cats the cat pajamas !! come for the shakes stay for the the southwest tots !!
Ikes Place has Some of the coolest combinations of Sandwiches around!! I have tried many different types here and have never been disappointed, however, if you are looking for a traditional sandwich this probably is not the best place to go. Be prepared to wait in line during peak hours as this place is wildly popular and for good reason. If you have the time to wait around it is definitely worth it, you get a candy apple lollypop and chips with your order so it is a win win in my book. I still have to try the Kryptonite Sandwich so if anyone has had it before please share some experience!!
Yes Yes Yes!!! Ike's is up there with "Seeing the Golden Gate Bridge," "Alcatraz," or "Visiting my ailing grandmother" on a list of Reasons to Get on a Plane and Get Thee to San Francisco.Tips: 1) Order by phone. 2) Get the Menage e Trois whether you know what you want or not. 3) Dutch bread ALWAYS, 4) Bring some Kleenex in case you cry, and 5) Stay nearby -- you might want seconds.
Hands down BEST sandwich place ever! Went here with a friend yesterday for the first time because she kept raving about how good it is and stuff. I heard the line gets super long but we went there Tuesday around 5:30 and there was barely a line. We got the Matt Cain and the Spiffy Tiffy and decided to swap a half for the other later. I was so excited it came with chips and a lollipop. It took about 10 minutes to get our sandwiches and then we headed to Dolores Park to sit down and eat. Right when we opened the Matt Cain, a dog at the park ran over LOL. These other people who were also at the park eating sandwiches from Ike's said the dog had did the same thing to them, The two sandwiches were delicious! Luckily, they had given us so many napkins because it could get really messy!
Like they need another review so I just have two words: Vegan Reuben on Dutch Crunch. Okay I know that's more than two. Get over it.
Allow me to shed my dignity and scream: BEST. SANDWICH. EVER.I can't even look at any other sandwiches the same way. Did you know a sandwich could taste this good? What's INSIDE THIS SANDWICH?Basically all the things my boyfriend and I murmured to each other between undignified nomfs of our respective Ike's Place sandwiches.The place deserves the hype. Their dirty sauce is delicious and their sandwiches are delicious, and it comes with a bag of chips! (And I'm not talking Lay's Potato Chips either.)We went during a magically not-too-busy hour (the gap after lunch but before dinner), so we didn't have to do a lot of waiting, and while there is no seating, we did manage to find a spot on the benches by the window. Service was very friendly, too.Seriously. Best sandwich ever. Would probably fly all the way back up to SF from LA just to eat here again. OPEN A BRANCH IN SOCAL PLEASE.
I'm sorry to be a sour patch but I thought this place was just A-OK. The staff is really sweet and absolutely amazing especially under the constant customers they have but standing in line for 30 minutes at 3 PM for two sandwiches and mozzarella sticks (though delicious...still...30 minutes?!) and then waiting an additional 20 minutes for our sandwiches...not so worth it. The dirty sauce is what makes the sandwich good. The rest of the ingredients are just the typical sandwich goodies except you can add mozzarella sticks (I ordered on the side and they were my favorite), jalapeno poppers and I think onion rings. I ordered the Dirty CA Roll on dutch crunch (the bread is good) which my dad thought was just okay and I ordered The Girl I'm Dating for myself. My dad tried my sandwich and said he liked how the chicken was chopped up. I found the chicken to be a bit dry...I wished there were more dirty sauce on it *sigh* but we were already gone. I tried some of his Dirty CA Roll (imitation crab sandwich) and I'm pretty sure the menu said it would have shrimp but there was none... They ran out of avocados *boo :(* which would have made both sandwiches all the more tasty.Duno....the dirty sauce is by far amazing and the mozzarella sticks were stringy and delightful (I LOVE CHEESE!!!!!). I would love to drench the sticks in that dirty dirty sauce! I can't get over the lines and the wait post-lines to get the sandwiches. PLUS my friends mega hyped Ike's place and the line didn't help! All in all a great experience, if I ever need a cheese fix and I'm in SF I'll call ahead and order them and then pick them up. BTW Ike has eyes that can make you swoon! I was watching him hand deliver the sandwiches to each customer while waiting and he had eyes that sparkle! Such a good owner :) Side note..parking is a biotch so either take public transportation or prepare to walk far o_O!
Getting a sandwich at Ike's is like buying a piece of art. The sandwich that you will soon consume will be so amazing, you just want to admire it as you eat it because you wonder how they construct it so that no matter how you bite it, nothing falls off ...it's worth the wait and every penny!! Ordered the Spiffy Tiffy (PESTO+THAT DIRTY SAUCE. OMGGG. to die for!!) But I think every sandwich here is amazing. Ike's is one of SF's best eats, they've been visited by nearly every foodie network (MvF and Food Network Duff Goldman) so, don't miss out!
I went here for the first time a few months ago. I can't say I was greatly impressed, only because there's so much hype on this place already that it set my standards high. Not to mention I have heard about this place so much from so many different people and I've seen it on Man vs. Food. SO, with that said, my expectations were pretty high when coming here the first time.Food-wise, they didn't fail to reach those expectations. I suppose the only thing keeping me from giving this place a complete 5 star rating is parking situation, and the fact that there are no tables and chairs to eat your sandwich. Which leaves you the only option to take out, or sit on the bench inside to eat, which can be kind of awkward when the place is as crowded as it gets. There's street parking (thanks San Francisco) but it's pretty worth it.Now let's move onto the sandwich. I've been here twice and enjoyed my sandwich each time. The sandwiches are huge and they come with a bag of chips and a lollipop. The lollipop is a cute touch. Be prepared to be full and to fall into a food coma after eating your sandwich! I can guarantee it'll happen.The staff is always super friendly. They seem to move at a fast pace, but sometimes they can't always keep up with the demand for these delicious sandwiches. You can even see them slave away in their sandwich assembly line as you order your food. Poor guys. Be nice to them!This place is definitely worth visiting again and again. Rumor has it that they're going to open a location at my school (SFSU). Can't wait for that!
Best sandwiches ever!!! There were so many people here when I stopped by, but it was definitely worth the wait. The Mnage A Trois was perfect, I loved the mix of BBQ and halal chicken. The sandwiches have super creative names and come with all sorts of crazy food combinations! They have a ton of gluten free and vegetarian options as well. The Voodoo chips that came with the sandwich were amazing too! I can't wait to come back and get more!
The Dish: I got the Menage A Trois on Dutch Crunch. Personally, I'm not a sandwich lover, but if you are, THIS PLACE WILL BLOW YOUR MIND INTO PIECES. Literally, you will not forget this place. No other sandwich will ever compare to Ike's. I seriously don't know what they do to make this sandwich taste this good, but I WILL BE BACK. Every bite is a bite of heaven. Not much more I can say, but you must come to Ike's.I went on their "birthday" and got free chips & drinks!Ambience: Not much of a sit-down place, but it's worth it. It's a hipster sandwich shop.
This sandwich shop has a wait like you wouldn't believe but the sandwiches did speak for themselves. This is a spot for local hipsters and overflow from The Castro, the Mission, and some out-of-towners who've read about it on Yelp. it's all about the Ike's dirty secret sauce but if I was to do it again I'd pay someone else to stay in line for me, go grab some coffee and meet them back in about an hour 'cause that's how long you'll wait... easily.

When you're done drinking your lattes, phone order in a We're Just Friends sandwich from Ike's Place.Walk over to Ike's to pick up your sandwich.Sit on the steps outside any of the gorgeous houses in the area.Share your sandwich and bag of chips with your friend.
Prepare to be licking your fingers and your face, as you're trying to figure how to not make a mess out of these delicious sandwiches... and fail. Coming from Ann Arbor, this is the closest sandwich I've had in the city to Zingermann's.The line frequently goes out the door, but it moves fairly quickly. Duboce park is nearby to hang out and enjoy the meal.
WOW...wow!The Elvis Keith was phenomenal! Halal chicken, teriyaki, wasabi mayo, swiss on a wheat bun was really, really tasty. DAMN TASTY!The menu selection is huge. Lots of veggie choices. This could be a new habit.
Best sandwiches I got to try so far in SF. Personal preference goes for the hot mamma houda, but every sandwich I tried there was delicious.Line can get very long, giving them a call 1h in advance is the best way to just go there and grab your sandwich.
3.5 stars. Don't hate!Very flavorful, but the sandwiches are just too saucy for my taste. If that's your thing, then ignore this review. I had to pay $2 to muni it out to the Castro since my co-workers were raving about Ike's. It was good, but not that good.I tried the Lizzy Lips: Halal chicken with pepper jack cheese and italian dressing on Dutch Crunch bread. The first half of my sandwich tasted fan-freakin'-tastic! I was alraedy full after half, but i forced myself to finish the other half because my co-worker told me the bread gets incredibly soggy if you try to save it for later.Pros: 1. Dirty Sauce is super flavorful. I heard it's made of garlic aioli, a ton of mayo, butter etc. 2. Free bag of "dirty" potato chips with sandwich order3. Big portionsCons: 1. Sandwich gets soggy fast2. Limited seating. I ate my sandwich sitting on a sidewalk in front of Sanchez College Prep School3. Expensive. Meat sandwiches are $9-13!!!4. Heavy tasting and food coma inducing. Destroys productivity once you get back to the office
With 3,000+ reviews, I can't say much else about Ike's that hasn't already been said... except that I think Ike's is good (solid 3.5-4.0), but not the best sandwiches I've ever had.I really wanted to fall madly in love with Ike's but I found his sandwiches to be just a little overwhelming. While I can appreciate how all of the ingredients come together and complement each other, I can't get through even half of my sandwich without feeling like I'm going to pop.What my friends and I got: "Menage A Trois" (honey mustard + honey + halal chicken + cheddar + swiss cheese + pepper jack on "Dutch Crunch" bread and Ike's "Dirty Sauce") -- though the bread gets soggy from the sauces after 10 minutes, the Menage A Trois is probably my favorite sandwich from Ike's IMHO. The chicken, a little dry, tastes good with the three cheeses and honey mustard. You definitely taste the honey, which gives it a nice, subtle, sweet taste to balance out the strong cheddar."Spiffy Tiffy" (halal chicken + pesto + mushrooms + pepper jack + provolone + avocado) -- solid sandwich, but the avocado and pesto did not mesh well for me. There really is no "ambiance" at Ike's, except for that of the one provided by Lime, the lounge/club that Ike's is located within. After 30 minutes or so, the loud "unce-unce-unce" synchronizing with the pulse of my shriveling stomach started to get irritating :\ when you're paying $15+ for a sandwich, "Dirty" chips, and a caramel apple lollipop, you're really just paying for that... no seats, no service, etc. Also, I would say you can save half of your sandwich for later (if you're overwhelmed by it like me) but even after 10 minutes, my sandwiches were near soggy. Any longer, it'd probably be almost completely mushy. Overall, do I think Ike's sandwiches are good? Yes, they are pretty good. Do I think it's worth waiting over an hour for? Eh, maybe not. If you come with friends, handy with some snacks, and/or if it's your first time, definitely brace yourself for the greatness that is Ike's. But let me pull you in for a little secret: we have better sandwiches in LA/OC :)
Delicious!! There is always a wait but it's well worth it. Also, everyone who works there is very friendly and outgoing!Once again...DELICIOUS!
Nothing I could say about this place that hasn't been gushed about dozens of times by other Yelpers. Still want to add my five stars to the pile and say that whoever thought of adding that hint of spiciness to the turkey-cranberry sandwich (Coming Home for Thanksgiving) is a genius.That's all.
Big fan of their sandwiches!! They have tons of options. It's hard to decide, but everything I've had here has been great. I especially like all their vegetarian options.
Realizing that no restaurant can live up to its hype, I approached Ike's with some trepidation a few weeks ago. Sensing this, the cashier was very friendly and helped me find just the right sandwich. She also suggested the "fusion" flavored chips, which were weirdly good.I chose the Matt Cain sandwich, which was pretty tasty (turkey, salami, roast beef). The sauce was pretty sloppy, but all the flavors worked, and in the end, it was a delicious sandwich.My only complaint (hence the 4 stars) is that the sandwiches are really expensive. At some level, I don't blame them for charging $10 for a sandwich (they could probably charge $15 and get away with it), but it will probably keep me from going back very often.
Yeah... eh. It's just average.The bread gets soggy ridiculously fast (which I presume is from the sauce), the insides are just okay. Nothing special really. I don't know, I realize sandwiches can get messy, but this is too messy... for me. It's a decent sandwich place, honest. I'm just saying there isn't much more to it than that: decent.This time I got the [Name of the Girl I'm Dating] cause it seemed like a lot of you yelpers liked it (besides, I would have tried the Menage a Trois but I don't want a "sweet" sandwich). I want to be completely honest and say it didn't really look appetizing... :/ I don't know.. I just can't really see what the hype is about. And I came back. The soggy-ness of the bread wasn't just from me taking it all the way back to my place, it just happens. Plus. WAY TOO EXPENSIVE. $10 for a sandwich? No thanks..Maybe it was just a slow and unsettlingly hot day in SF. Maybe. But def not the best sandwiches in San Francisco. Lou's in the Richmond district is a better bet.
BEST Sandwiches in San Francisco!!!! we drove from Monterey to Ike's for dinner one night because I had been craving an Ike's Place masterpiece for weeks!first went in 2010 after seeing it on Man vs. Food, hungover as all get out- i still scarfed down 1/2 my sandwich in one sitting! I'm a light eater typically, non-eater when hungover..... nothing coulda stopped mii after that first bite!got a chicken Parmesan w/marinara sauce&mozzarella sticks-- lovely. got the same in 2011. still good.got the Home For Thanksgiving turkey/cranberry----OMGoodness I was in HEAVEN!doubt I'll ever stray from the HFT now that I've tried it- I'm in love- with food.LUCKILY, we got there just in time (OK not really, they closed at 7p) we arrived at 7:07 (they have moved from the tiny space they had across the street & are now next to Tangerine). after a quick plea since we had just driven almost Three Hours for Sandwiches, they let us in to order! Thank Goodness cuz i probably would've cried if they said no..... but they didn't cuz Ike's Place is AWESOME!!!!!go. you won't be disappointed.
I just love the place. The dirty sauce is what makes it the best sandwich in the city. I took me the first visit 3 years ago to get hooked to it. My all time favorite is the Mission PZ Burger, even though they're not making it anymore :(I can just recommend this place to everyone. Just be patient, the lines are looong :)
It's good but it wasn't as WOWWW as I expected/hoped for, too much hype on yelp. It's not worth the 40minute wait for a sammich. I told BF to call-in to order then pick it up, but he forgot so he was in line for 40 minutes (this place is too popular). He went around 11:30AM, so around lunch time, is that the reason for the line?! I'm glad I didn't experience that, I probably would have left. It wasn't Black Friday & it wasn't free, I wouldn't wait that long...or would I? Maybe if they had those restaurant pager type things so I wouldn't have to stay in line the entire time.Yesterday I got:#85 Super Mario - beef meatballs, mozzarella sticks, marinara#59 Cristina and Umair Go to Ike's Place - turkey, bacon, ham, salami, Italian dressing, avocado, & provoloneSuper Mario was nice & flavorful. There are mozzarella sticks in it, COOL! The Cristina & Umair sandwich was good, but I prefer the Super Mario.I would say the names of the sandwiches are unique and cool (Al Bundy, the name of the girl I'm dating, we're just friends...), but I don't live very close nor do I want to wait in a super long line.I don't think I would come all the way here for a sandwich, but maybe if I was in the area & there wasn't a line then I'll be back to try something else.For each sandwich you buy, you get a Charm's cotton candy lollipop. My lollipop wrapper was slightly ripped, so I couldn't eat it =[
Want to be full for the next two day? Order the Doomsday or Kryptonite - These sandwiches are unlike anything you've tried before. All of them worth the wait in line. Don't leave town without trying it at least once.If you go on your birthday your sandwich is free.
I remember one New Years eve concert many years ago that will be told for years to come. The main act was super late, there were balloons and streamers in the rafters and confetti canons around the arena. Around 1:30am, the "act" started counting down "5,4,3..." all to a chorus of boos. A hyped up act that did not deliver.You feel what I'm getting to at Ike's. Although it's a story that won't be told for years, I came here expecting greatness. I got goodness. The ratio of bread to filling was 3:5, which is always good in my book.  There were many complimenting flavors, which is always good in my book.  And they were willing to step out of the box and try things I would not even imagine being in a sandwich. Again, good in my book.Order ahead, and make sure you know where this place is! Not well signed...well, not signed at all! And...bring money...lots of money. This isn't your typical five dollar footlong.
Dutch crunch. Anything with cranberry. Om nom nom. The lines are often really long - usually a meal I have to allot a chunk of time for.
We came here to try the sandwiches, and I was really that we came! We ordered SF giant and Spiffy Tiffy (both on dutch crunch bread), and both were delicious! Even though we didn't eat the sandwiches there, but they still tasted great after 20 minutes of BART ride back home.  The only thing i would not do next time is to add onion rings in my sandwich. The idea sounded great, but by the time i got home, the onion rings were very soggy... :(  oh well, it was still worth the try! Make sure to get your sandwich on the DUTCH CRUNCH BREAD!!! yummy!
I went up to San Francisco to meet some friends. I had never heard of Ike's but my friends said it was really good, so we tried it.I walked into the fairly plain sub shop. There are no tables, just some registers, coolers for bottled drinks and bags of chips. The menu is on copied sheets of paper. It's a pretty simple operation.The menu is about 4 sheets of paper stapled together. Each page is different sandwiches: vegan, vegetarian, gluten free and meat sandwiches. There are so many options it's daunting. I swear I looked at the menu for 20 minutes. I settled on the "We're Just Friends" which was Halal Chicken, Avocado, Orange Glaze and Pepper Jack on choice of bread. As I was commanded to get the crusty Dutch bread and it did not disappoint. The sandwich was delicious. It was an amazing combination of flavors. I would have liked more spice but I was fine without it. There are several options for chips. I chose the "Funky Fusion" which is like barbecue but different. It's almost like the amazing "All Dressed" Ruffles that are only found in the glorious land of Canada. There are bottled beverages. I chose a tasty libation called Leninade which I guess was a communist lemonade.Afterwards, my friends and I went to the Catholic Church that was featured in the film "Sister Act" and ate our sandwiches on the steps of St. Paul's. It was an amazing meal.
Best sandwiches ever. I can't even compare it to anything - it's the most unique, wonderful sandwich experience my mouth has ever had. My home fry and I ordered the Coming Home for Thanksgiving (we have a mutual love for turkey dinners between two slices of bread) and the Menage a Tois, as recommended. Both were made on the absolutely amazing Dutch Crunch bread and both were absolutely delicious. Explosions of flavor - so much is going on, it's like an amusement park ride on your tongue.I also must point out that i love the actual physical establishment - it's so very San Francisco. I love. Topped it off with a lovely root beer and some salt and vinegar chips. Next time i'm in town, I'm making my way straight back here!
With rave reviews, my friends and I expected greatness from this iconic sandwich shop. What a HUGE disappointment.Menage A Trois - Good, but, definitely not worth spending $11.Matt Cain - Do not know why this sandwich gets so much hype. Just plain AVERAGE.The sauce was the worst part.Friend had another sandwich that was subpar; not worth mentioning. Obviously forgettable. LOLOur afternoon visit had a bright spot - voodoo chips. They were absolutely addicting. Bottom Line:Ike's Place DID NOT IMPRESS. Sure the voodoo chips are the bombdotcom. But, their acclaimed sandwiches, simply put, are mediocre. Paseo in Seattle still reigns supreme as the best sandwich shop in America.
Loved the experience here, mainly because we called in around 10am on a Saturday and experienced absolutely no wait. I think that if you have to wait for something for extended amounts of time, the food better be utterly fantastic or amazing. Otherwise, not worth my time. If I had to wait 1 hour + for this sandwich, it would receive only 3 stars.Suggestion: call in beforehand, and if you have the right sort of transportation, then you're good to go.I had the manage-a-trois sandwich on dutch crunch. Wonderful combination of flavor and sauce. Absolutely delicious! The website is also really helpful (has accurate pictures!), and I just love the creativity of the sandwich names.Can't wait to try other sandwiches...If given the opportunity to call in again!
I never wrote a review for this place?! im so ashamed of myself...but then again, y'all dont need my opinion on this placeIt is amazing...amazing! And i am LOVING their new location...take that complaining neighbors from the old location..i har har har in your face!...new place has seats AND i can wait inside!love their sanchez and just tried their elvis keith today....all i have to say is GO DIRTY SAUCE and GET EVERYTHING on it....well minus the tomatoes =) cause i dont like tomatoesHappy birthday IKE and thanks for the free sandwich...i love you =)
Heck yeah!!!! Finally, a place that makes every sandwich hot and toasty the way I like.Thanks to Bonnie L. for the recommedation to try Ike's. Clearly a superstar on Yelp, Ike's Place has stellar reviews and deservedly so. Rather than add too much, here's a condensed version:LOVE* the menu variety and names* the dirty sauce, whatever it is, is great!* dutch crunch is awesome* Ike delivered the sandwiches to our car while we were waiting. The place was packed and he left the store to walk half a block to us. Awesome service! minor- our added sprouts was placed into the Al Bundy sandwich by mistake instead of my Jeri's BIG meat sandwich. No biggie.- parking sucks- the wait is insane. We called before driving to SF at 1 pm and were told it would be an hour. It was ready at 2 pm on the dot! Amazingly lines were out the door at 2 pm. Order early!- the sandwich wasn't as stuffed as I expected....but I'm just mad that I didn't order the Superman or the Doomsday like I wanted. I was afraid it would be too much meat.....there's never TOO much meat!- credit cards, but no amex.P.S. The Superman consists of: Roast Beef, Corned Beef, Pastrami, Salami, Turkey, Bacon, Ham, Avocado, Jack. Awesome!
This place is awesome. I can't remember the name of the sandwich I had, but it was the prime rib(?) one at the very end of the menu and the most expensive. Totally worth every penny and the wait in line. Ike's definitely know how to make a sandwich. I didn't try adding all the extras and am glad I didn't because the base sandwich was already huge enough. Very satisfied customer here.
They now have locations in sfsu and also redwood city. the line can be quite a wait, and i have yet to visit their new location yet. the special sauce is good, but i dont think im really to find out whats inside, just let me enjoy
Ike's Place always has a huge line out the door. I've tried three sandwiches, and I might be the only person who has left it satisfied once with the Name of the Girl I'm Dating. Everything else has seemed like it tasted too heavy or fatty for me. Sorry, but I'd rather take my dollars to Ted's Market and Deli for tri tip any day of the week.
Nom nom nom nom nommmmm. Started off a daytrip by going to Ike's. There was practically no wait at the time. Ordered a Menage a Trois (3 way) sandwich at the worker's recommendation. Though the sandwich was a little pricey at ~$12, it was a good size to share with the gf. Also came with a bag of Dirty chips. We got a bottle of Dang It's Good butterscotch root beer too. I'm always a fan of those unique drinks.After waiting for a good five minutes or so (and being called Fernando -__-) we got our sandwich. There's not much space inside to eat -- no tables -- and it gets quite crowded with the queue of people waiting for their sandwiches. We took a stroll up the street to the local library to munch.About the sandwich! It came with shredded chicken and had honey in it! I've never had honey in a sandwich, so this was a first. They're not shy at all about it however, so the sweet honey taste runs strong in every bite. To finish off the meal, they gave us a caramel apple pop in the sandwich bag! One of my favorite old candies, what a treat!A little pricey, but I would consider coming back in the future. Be warned of naked people walking around on Castro and Market nearby if you go strolling afterward.
The line to Ike's goes on for eternity. We came on a Saturday and I was not prepared to wait over an hour OR for my stomach to eat itself. But we held on to the promise of delicious sounding stoner-inspired sandwiches. After all, there was a line down the block for this, so it had to be worth it right? Wrong.As suggested, we tried 3 of their most popular sammies: Mnage-a-trois ($11) Chicken, Honey, BBQ, Pepper Jack, Swiss, Smoked Gouda. I prefer my sandwiches not to be sweet and sticky. I was disappointed AND covered in honey. Super Mario ($11) Meatballs, mozzarella sticks, marinara. Other than the mozzarella sticks getting limp and soggy, it was the best of the bunch. I liked this one the most.Paul Reubens ($10) Corned beef, poppy seed coleslaw, French dressing, Swiss- good, not great.I like that their menu is huge and they have tons of options for everyone, you too vegans! And I like that they come with a bag of Dirty Potato Chips. Now comes the big BUT: It's pretty pricey for a sandwich, there was nowhere to sit and the sandwiches didn't live up to the hype. Good, just not good enough to stand in a line for over an hour.
Screw your pretentious open faced sandwiches you eat with a freaking knife and fork, this is place serves the real deal! There's not much more to said. This place is AMAZING. There's always a new sandwich for me to try because their selection is HUGE. You really can't go wrong with whatever you choose. Ike is a cool guy too, once I was peering into their kitchen as I was waiting in line, and he came through and was like, "It's cool, check it out!". I guess he sensed my slight embarrassment. I would have stopped trying to be so nosey if he hadn't said that, but I was like, "Alright, cool. Thanks!!" and just continued watching their workers streamline sandwiches out like busy bees.The bread is crunchy and warm, the right portion of delicious meat (Halal chicken...O.M.G.), and the SAUCE was all over. ALL OVER. I am craving one right now just thinking about it. Really, it's that good.
Best sandwiches in San Francisco. Hands down!(and I've eaten a lot of sandwiches in San Francisco...)Every sandwich I've ever gotten here has been delicious. The sodas they have are super good too. They have an amazing variety of options for sandwiches, and you just can't seem to go wrong. If you haven't been there you're for sure missing out.. Go to Ike's!
Ike is an awesome guy! He donated trays and trays of food for my non-profit, "Imagining More's" event last year! He even named a sandwich after me when I made the London Olympic team. Check out the Shannon Rowbury...salmon teriyaki with provolone. It's delicious, Ike helped me craft it! And the food, well, the lines outside the store speak for themselves. The food is so flavorful! Visit and enjoy!
super tasty options. can't remember the number i got but it was a chicken honey mustard on their regular bread. very tasty. good desserts too.
I've always wanted to try Ike's (due to the hype sadly..) but just never had the chance. It's been a little over a year since I heard about it and one of my friends from Australia was finally coming to visit! With his first trip in San Francisco, I wanted to take him to all the cool spots! I created this special week schedule for him where I had a list of places to take him. Last minute, he told me he wanted to try Ikes. He told me he had heard about it from a show called Man Vs. Food! I added it Ike's for the second day and because our schedule was sooo busy, Ike's was last on our list (for dinner) then to GGB! I drove as fast I could to make it before closing. Closing is at 7 pm. We got there around 6:50 pm but it was a hassle to find parking. The streets were busy with cars and I've never been in the area, so I didn't know where to go. Eventually we found parking at around 6:57 pm. We walked as fast as we could to Ike's, arriving at 6:58 pm, huffing and puffing. Honestly, I was expecting them to tell us, "Sorry, we're closed," but to our surprise, the wonderful staff greeted us and told the employees in the kitchen to keep the stove on because we just came in! That is some great customer service you have there! Huffing and puffing, he asked what we wanted to order. I told him this was our first time trying Ike's and asked for some recommendations. He recommended us 5 sandwiches and I chose #111, Menage A Trois on Dutch Crutch. They also have these unique chips with like 8 flavors I think. After arriving at GGB and sitting on a picnic blanket, I finally took a bite of my sandwich. The sauce was distinct and unique, which made my sandwich 10x better, because I have never tasted anything like this! I fell in love.. with a sandwich. I have never tasted a sandwich THIS good! I wanted more, but I knew I couldn't, since they had already closed by now. I eventually came back weeks later, and I was still greeted by the wonderful staff, offering the same great service that I had experienced my first time. I had a Spiffy Tiffy next, and it wasn't the sandwich for me. It had too much pesto sauce but it was still good..just not as good as Menage A Trois! ;) Glad they opened a location at SFSU, because now I don't have to drive across the city for this! But either way, I wouldn't mind. It's one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten! Long story short, great service, delicious sandwiches, and if you don't know what to get, get the Menage A Trios! :)Fun fact: They work for tips...or phone numbers ;)
After moving in just a few blocks from this place I finally found a time to go and check it out.Had it once at the Stanford location, but had heard that this location was significantly better. Let me just say, Menage a trois is where it's at! No complaints--this sandwich was incredible rich and creamy..definitely a luxury sandwich. BUT I can say this. If you are looking to treat yourself to a creamy / dirty / rich indulgence, then this is the way to go. Sure, it is just as delicious as that friend chicken at 4 am on a Saturday night out, but you are also likely consuming all your calories for the day and rest of the week. Honestly to compare with other delicious sandwiches I have had, I personally prefer the freshness of Lou's Cafe. The biggest differentiating factor--you are in heaven for the whole couple minutes it takes you to eat it, but you don't feel guilty at the end. Plus the service and environment at Lou's crushes that at Ike's. At the end of the day, Ike's is great, but not a place I would go back to regularly.
waiting makes me hungrystarted out greatmaybe too rich for mealways ends in tummy ache/womp womp
Came here today to re-live the ike's experience. We placed our order over the phone an hour prior to showing up. The person who took my order was very precise but it was very loud over the phone. The new location is pretty close to the first location except this place is bigger. There is actually room for us to be inside the actual place. There are also benches to sit.When we arrived we were very surprised to see that there was no line! We technically didn't even have to place the order beforehand. Barely a line! WHAT HAPPENED?!We got our sandwiches which is about the same price as before and walked over to Dolores Park to enjoy our sandwiches.I ordered the Barry Z and my bf ordered the SF Giants. The menu has changed a bit and has a lot of Giant's related sandwiches and vegan options. Although the sandwiches are just as good the size is obviously smaller. We believe this is the reason for the lack of long lines. It is still worth it since they meal comes with a bag of chips and a lolly.
Ike's was a great choice for us. My bf and I studied the menu extensively online and finally decided on the Nacho Boy on sourdough. We shared 1 sandwich and it filled us up completely. It was pure perfection, it had crunch from the bread, the swiss cheese and meat were perfectly melted together and there was so much avocado that it stuffed out the sides! It was a remarkable sandwich piled high with meat and mushrooms. We really enjoyed ourselves dining on this sandwich. We would go back here again and split another sandwich, because they are so tasty! 1 sandwich here is enough food in my opinion to fill up 2 people. :)
Loved Ike's
This is the king of sandwiches! I always get the Pizzle, and it never fails to satisfy. It puts the comparable Quizno's chicken bacon ranch to shame. What's not to love? Freshly baked dutch crunch bread, check. Fresh lettuce and tomatoes, check. Shredded halal chicken smothered in Ike's delicious dirty sauce and ranch, check. Cheddar cheese and crunch BACON, check! One of these days I'm going to branch out to other sandwiches. The Menage a Trois and Spiffy Tiffy look particularly scrumptious, but for now, I am satisfied with my tried and true favorite.Fellow yelper, Alan W. is correct! Ike's sandwiches taste good even after they've sat around for a few hours without refrigeration and have gotten a bit cold. I've taken one of these babies to go, and it still tasted just as good the next day with a bit of microwaving. Mmmmmm.I only wish that I lived in San Francisco so I could enjoy these sandwiches more often! As a comparison, I'd say that Ike's Place in SF makes MUCH bigger and more generously portioned sandwiches than Ike's Lair in Redwood City. The wait is comparably longer too. :-/ But this location also gives you a bag of dirty chips to go along w/ the massive sandwich and caramel apple pop!Word to the wise: Call your order in so you don't have to wait half an hour to sink your teeth into one of these.
I didn't think the sandwich or the shop was very nice. Maybe I should try again!Sorry Ike!
I've heard so much about this place - always from my friends regarding the wait time or the amazing sandwiches and I'm so glad that I got to try it myself. Walking to Dolores Park with sandwiches, chips and a drink was a great idea. Catching some sun and getting to hang out with friends was really fun. I got the Menage-a-Trois on Dutch Crunch. So delicious. I'm hungry just thinking about it now. The funky fusion chips are the best ones - they're like bbq chips...sorta. They cut the sandwich in half for you and we had told the lady that we were splitting it so she actually gave us 2 lollipops and separated out the sandwiches for us. Damn it was delicious. Chicken was amazing and the flavors all melted together. It was messy, but the messy things are the best right?I want to try different sandwiches now - maybe on my weekends I'll head into the Mission and try more things! "I just had a Menage-a-Trois and it was amazing..."
i was fortunate to try my first ike's sandwich when a friend picked me up a menage a trois and brought it to a giants game for me. having a craving for the menage a trois I check yelp and find they have an app to preorder! I instantly download the app and set up my acct and placed an order for pick up at 12:30. so I get there at 12:45 in case they are running behind and my son runs in and it's not ready. they tell him 5 minutes...while waiting I find parking in front and come on and they finally call out our order my son grabs the bags and we step out.however I didn't know if the chips were included although I see all customers with bags, so my son goes back in to ask and they tell him to grab one. not knowing he grabbed one bag although we ordered 2 sandwiches. the sandwiches were good however the chicken this time was dry and some pieces were hard to chew. for future I would hope they tell customers, such as newbs like us, about grabbing our chips, especially when we spend $11 a sandwich...and they have pick up orders ready in time even when the status on the app still said 12:30. so just minus one store for this reasons. I will be back again to try their other sandwiches and the menage a trois again, i think the dry one today was just an off sandwich :)
Yum. First, we walk in a bit confused after getting THE BEST parking spot (right out front)... two lines, VIP, whaaa? But we figured it out. Picked a sandwich per recommendation (Elvis Keith - uber yum). All ready to check out and he offered us chips. Yes, they are included! Score. Sandwich was spicy and tasty, wrapped well, and easy to share (a half for each of us). Chips are standard. Case full of drink choices. Helpful staff. Lacking... lots of seating. We went mid-day on a Saturday, found seats on the window-seat and started eating. Why was no one else eating here? Most people got it and left, but granted there isn't a place to eat outside. Besides the seating, which was't a problem for us, all excellent. Delicious. We even debated going back later in the day for more. Ha.
This place is so whatever and overrated in terms of sandwiches. After experiencing Little Luca's in South City, I spit on all other sandwich shops. Also, its always uber packed here with people from out of town, and they run out of ingredients.
Finally! Much anticipated...and a little disappointed. Of course I could count on my fellow foodie to accompany me to the famed Ike's. Not too bad of a line when we went and I liked the menu. The ingredients they use all sound like they'll be delicious together. We split the "Spiffy Tiffy" and "Menage A Trois". Both were actually good sandwiches, but for the amount you pay....hard to see the value. Call it over-hyped. Call it overrated. No doubt worth checking this place out and trying a sandwich or two, but I prefer Little Lucca's any day. When fatties unite, ALWAYS OVER-ORDER!
We called in our order about an hour ahead of time- it apparently gets very busy here. All I can vouch for is the menage a trois sandwich and although I have no real clue what was inside this sandwich, I can say it was definitely delicious as everyone has been saying. Again, as with my top sandwich experiences have shown the bread is what makes any sandwich shines and this is what Ike's got right.I love that the place is within walking distance of a park where you can enjoy your sandwich, people watch, and the weather (given that it is a nice day out). I did not like that the line to order sandwiches blocks the restrooms.
Seeing there was nearly 6,000 reviews I had to give it a shot. Overall I like the sandwich but the place was filthy.. not sure why a place that is such a sandwich staples in SF has to look like such a dump. The food was good but like other reviewers state, you need to eat it immediately since its warm and the it will become a very soggy sandwich if you wait.
Amazing sandwiches. Line can suck at times but they have a great app where you can pre-order for a specific time for pick up (times can get full though, so best to plan ahead).
Menage a Trois.Sounds exciting. Sinful. Yet, it's quite scrumptious.
Personally, I think this place is overrated. Also, it is incredibly expensive to buy a sandwich, drink, and chips. Not a fan of their sandwiches.
The Kyptonite: the best sandwich I have ever put in my face. No jokies. After seeing this place on Man vs. Food, we specifically drove all the way from Sacramento just to see what all the fuss was about... WOW. This is what's on the Kryptonite: Roast Beef, Corned Beef, Pastrami, Salami, Turkey, Bacon, Ham, Mozzarella Sticks, Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers, Beer Battered Onion Rings, Avocado, Pesto, EXTRA Pepper Jack HOLY. ESS. Amazing. Spectacular. Kick-me-in-the-face good. The sandwich was about as big as a small compact car, so I split it with my husband. I hate the WHOLE half. I literally couldn't stop. The dirty sauce? I wanna rub it in my eyes. The mozzarella sticks? Oh lawd. And ya know what rocked? I was there with my best friend, who is Muslim, and therefore can't eat any pork or pork products. She asked if she could order the sandwich with all of the piggie bits left out. The order guy told her he would do her one better: they could do beef pastrami, turkey bacon, and turkey-ham! It make it totally pork-free without sacrificing flavor. HUGE bonus points for making my girl's day. =) Other stuff: * They get busy. Like, crazy busy. We showed up around 11am, and were able to order right away. But by the time we had gotten our food and had tucked in, they was a line out the door and starting to stretch down the street. * The menu is friggin HUGE. I think there's 200 different options of the menu... and that's not an exaggeration for comedic effect. I think the Kryptonite was #200. geez.* The store front is deceiving. It's kind of hidden in plain sight, right on Market but lacking any sort of obvious sign or banner. I think they JUST moved into this new location - which, by the way, had surprisingly modern decor: they have a big white marble bar with hot pink mirrored wall, boxy white ottoman/chair things, and what appeared to be a dancefloor and DJ booth. Weird? Verdict: For the love of all the is nom, GO.
Our drug reps sometimes bring sandwiches from here for us...ABSOLUTELY delicious! a bit on the saucy side, though, so be prepared with an army of napkins. Parking isn't the best here but it's SF, where is there EVER good parking right?
Food: 4/5- Great sandwiches!Service: 3/5- Good service, but nothing memorable. It can be a bit slow and the wait can be longEnvironment: 3/5- Standard no frills to go restaurant. However, parking situation is horrible.Value: 2/5- A combo meal was around $14. That's pricey for a non-sit down sandwich restaurant.Return again?: Maybe, but only if I can drop off a friend when they open in the morning so that I don't have to park or wait in line.
Beware there is nowhere to sit and they will NOT let you eat near the location (they pay someone to watch where you go to eat!)...but it was worth it. I think I just ate the best sandwich I've ever had! The Spiffy Tiffy with crunchy bread. Yes.
My favorite sandwich place in the Bay!! I always get the Stiffy Tiffy with BACON!! droolsssssss.. MUST TRY!!
Seriously, words cannot describe the amazing joy I feel when I hold the fat, paper brown bag, equivalent to the feel of holding a small baby. I think I would choose holding a bag of Ike's sandwiches over a baby every time.I love that they have so many options, and every time I've eaten it, the sandwiches meet my expectations every bite! The bread is warm and perfectly toasted, there's just the right amount of sauce that oozes out, and everything in between the bread is delicious!I've gotten the Menage A Trois each visit, but this time I branched out and also got the Jim Rome (YES, I said also, meaning I got two.....don't judge ^_^). The Menage A Trois was just as good as I remembered and the Jim Rome was SO yummy!! The red pesto really makes it pop. I was tempted to eat both sandwiches but controlled myself to eat just half of each, and I'm glad I did because now I've got Ike's for dinner!!
Went to their new location today. Called ahead to place our order (6 sandwiches), and they told us it would be 20 minutes. perfect. :) BUT..they didnt have dutch crunch bread!! why oh why?!!? whyyy?! all of us in the car went on about how our heart stopped when we heard that. :P (ok, a little overly dramatic...but...dutch crunch...WHY?!) So we got wheat. :( but it was still good. :P I got their Menage A Trois, as per my friend's excited recommendations. Halal chicken, cheese, honey mustard, and real honey. YUM. i was wondering why it was so sweet (now i know its probably the honey + honey mustard) but it is really amazing. the soft tender chicken with the sweetness...and the dirty sauce all over your fingers...MMMMM....I dont know what that sauce is made up of, but its delicious, and brings the whole sandwich together.My friend got the "Change", and I took a bite. it was REALLY good. very different from Menage A Trois. Not as much sweetness in it (no honey), and its sliced ribeye, the dirty sauce, and onion rings. yes, onion rings. My friend also added pesto to her sandwich. (I LOVE PESTO) and it was really quite an amazing blend of flavors. I'm drooling thinking about this. One tip: They dont have tables. We drove to the Twin Peaks and ate out lunch as we perched up there, enjoying the view. Twin Peaks was pretty close to Ike's, so I totally recommend!!
The wait is ridiculous sometimes - they can't handle the amount of orders they get at peak hours, which makes sense since they are one of the best sandwich places in the city. I live far away so I've been experimenting with task rabbit and get it now to get it delivered across the city. Task rabbit has been cheaper ($10 dollars) but their coordination isn't as good as get it now as some of task rabbit's couriers are confused as to how the process works (Do I call Ike's first? Do I just give my order to them and have them place it?).But still, sometimes it is worth going through the trouble for a place that will put jalapeno poppers in my sandwich.
A sandwich place that serves jalapeno poppers and onion rings on their sandwiches? WIN! After hearing about how amazing this sandwich place was from reading numerous reviews, I made it a priority to stop here upon visiting San Francisco last winter. I was not disappointed, so worth the jaunt from my hotel. The most difficult part was deciding what to order, so many appealing sandwiches grace their giant menu! And a free bag of chips? Heck yes. I don't know what's in their Dirty Sauce, but I do know that I want more of it in my life. Oh Ike's, how I love your giant, delicious, messy sandwiches.A word of caution: Don't go and sit in the nearby dog park to chow down as you'll find yourself surrounded by several pooches very eager to become your new best friend.
The first time I tried Ike's Place was the first time I traveled to SF. It must have been almost 45 minutes after I bought my sandwich when I started eating it (got lost taking the bus back to where I was staying). By then, the sandwich was cold and a little soggy. Despite that, it was still one of the best sandwiches I've had.
ke's makes me so happy. Best sandos around! The staff is nice, friendly and very patient -- which they would have to be with all of the options and the long lines. Sometimes they sing while they make your sandwich. As crowded as it can be at times, people are generally nice. AND the sandwiches are the bomb! I'm not vegan or even vegetarian but when I order the vegan meatball sandwich, I usually can't tell it's not meat! Delish!
Ike's converted me to become a Sandwich lover. He opened my eyes that sandwiches are not just two sliced bread and some cold meat slapped together.I was there when Ike's was in the original location. Waiting in line at first because I did not know I could call in. Then I became familiar with auto-dial and also learn to be patient when put on hold. Thank God for Ike's app on iphone! I was probably one of the first to download that app cause I stalked Ike's Place on Facebook.Two months ago, I was at Lime's talking to the bouncer trying to get my sandwich fix. Then, I even went to Stanford to pick up my sandwich on a Sunday. This past Saturday, I went to Ike's new location in SF and picked up my Barack. There are tables for us to sit on! Ike himself was there greeting customers. It was 11:45 am and there was no line. Did everyone go to that Cherrry thing? Well, good for me. Fav Ike's: 108. Do You Smell What Barack Is Cooking? thinly sliced ribeye steak, bbq, smoked gouda - w/ Dutch Crunch and everything on it.
Honestly, this place is worth the hype! I absolutely love their sandwiches and the dutch crunch bread is just amazing! They have an amazing selection of sandwiches with so much variety. The heath ledger is my absolute favorite here! There are very few places with as many vegetarian options as meat! I love their red pesto sauce. You will enjoy every bite of your sandwich! Enough said, its totally worth a try!
I was super overwhelmed by the menu the first time I tried Ike's; luckily, it's the kind of place where you can't go wrong!The dutch crunch is amazing, and I'm confident that anything I try will be delicious and satisfying.I love grabbing a sandwich and heading over to dolores park on a sunny day. i also love the caramel apple lollipops they give you!
Two words: Gluten. Free. Separate, they're beautiful things. Together (Gluten Free), they become an ugly, foul-tasting, larger than life frustration. I will harp on this all day if you let me but I'd like to see you try not to if every time you put anything even remotely tainted in your mouth, you swelled up like the Pillsbury Dough Boy (also not gluten free) and began itching everywhere, including under your eyelids and in between your toes.That being said, Ike's does gluten free! No, it's not that hard to do. But most places won't bother. Because most places, much like myself, have zero patience for or desire to serve those who have cut out gluten and wheat for dietary reasons. (screw you all, by the way. if you really COULDN'T eat wheat because it would kill you, you'd be scarfing down pizzas, pasta, and sandwiches like they were going to run out). Ike's, however, does gluten free. And they do it well. My gluten-free Barry Z was really good as of late. It was "toasted" in butter, I'm pretty sure, and someone over there did a good job of finding a gluten-free bread that doesn't taste like or have the texture of sheet rock. Before 12 there was no line (although I have seen them out the door earlier on other occasions) and service was fast and friendly. The G-F sandwiches are noticeably smaller than the traditional bread ones but that's ok. When it's cooked in butter and has avocado and mayonnaise on it, portion control is probably a good thing. Mmmmmmmm.
My sister and cousin went to Ike's on Monday and picked up the Spiffy Tiffy for me. Oh.My.Gosh...I came home hours later and it was STILL good. The chicken was soft, the bread not totally soggy (remember, I didnt get to it till a few hours later). Kudos on the Spiffy Tiffy.Okay, so...that was Monday. Not enough. I found myself and the bf heading there Tuesday after work. Heffer status? Yes. So!?! I called in my order to avoid waiting in line. I got there 20 minutes later and there was no line for the call in orders and my order was ready to go.Menage A Trois- Got home 25 minutes after the pick up and it was super soggy. BUT its totally worth still eating. The barbeque, the honey and chicken work so well together in this sandwich it literally makes my mouth water. A nice mix of sweet and savory.Say Hey- Nothing fancy, but straight to the point. Pastrami.bacon.swiss = all you need. Goood.Matt Cain (minus the God father sauce)- Good. I say that lightly. I dont know why I expected more from this. I had a few bites from the bf and found the salami overpowered the turkey and roastbeef. I look forward to tryint the other stuff on the menu. I'll definitely be back.
The most bomb sandwiches!! Some people might say a sandwich is just a sandwich. Well... They obviously have never been to Ike's! Not only are the sandwiches finger-lickin'-good (sorry KFC, but Ike's sandwiches actually make me want to lick my fingers) but the atmosphere in the store is friendly and awesome. If you want a great spot to have lunch, dinner, or are just randomly hungry, go to Ike's Place!
So Ike's moved to Lime, I really didn't even know what to expect. But here it goes, driving around trying to find the spot... hmmm now sign? Oh wait there's A HELLA LONG LINE! I bet that's it. Street Parking always sucks when we finally parked we walked on over and got in the line which grew longer and longer as we waited. Half of the people in line were confused about what was going on, since all of us in line were just trying to get some food... but where is there a bouncer?? The Bouncer is for Lime the place was packed that Saturday afternoon for Lime's endless mamosas, while people were getting drunk inside Lime, those waiting in line thought, "it's 1pm and these people are getting smashed". While waiting in line printed lists of the sandwiches circulated throughout the line. The menu is split from Vegan, Veggies & Meats. View the entire menu hereilikeikesplace.com/wp-coWe settled for the M.I.L.F (Halal Chicken Breast, Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers, Franks Red Hot, Ranch) & Fat Bastard (Ham, Bacon, EXTRA Ike's Dirty Sauce, America) Fat Bastard (left) & M.I.L.F (right)media3.ct.yelpcdn.com/bpFinally one you got to the front of the line you were able to make an order but get this, Lime was so busy, THERE WASN'T ANYWHERE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO EAT TO SIT.....SO....Basically you waited in line to order, pay, and wait in another line to get your food which you will not be eating inside. After nearly 2 hours we got our food and luckily a neighboring Pete's Coffee's outdoor bench was clear so we decided to eat our food there. Sandwiches are delicious the sourdough bun that my sandwich was on, was like heaven! Dirty sauce I Love you! The Sandwiches we got were awesome but that wait was pretty stupid I must say. I'll be back but I'm not sure if it will be at this location. I guess a plus besides the food was seeing people yack on the streets at 3pm... sitting next to us was an older guy who simply just said man these people need to quit if they can't handle their liquor, my reply "seriously it's only 3pm"Ike's really really really LEGIT sandwiches yet this location hasn't given us a horrible wait experience to eat along the streets, the food gets 5 stars but in an overall review it loses one because of the location.PS. you can call orders in to pick up, & I like the announcement posted here on Yelp[AnnouncementLime's Bouncer is an A-Hole. I would like to apologize ahead of time if you end up coming to Ike's on a Sat and have to deal with him.]We seen a bunch of people who were trying to get in and obviously didn't like him.
Ikes place is delicious. The sandwiches are fun and interesting even down to the name of the sandwich! This location is in the middle of the mission and is a little crowded at times. The staff is kind and understanding of all of their sandwiches! My favorite is the hot mama huda! SOOO GOOD!
Thanks to SCOUTMOB, we got a deal for a FREE sandwich at Ike's! I got the Elvis Keith (chicken terriyaki) and grabbed the funky flavor (sweet/ bbq) dirty chips they had stacked up and a caramel apple candy! Price of the sandwich without the deal would have been $10- so yay scoutmob!! =)I was too full to eat it though (had a fresh salmon sandwich all to myself at the farmer's market at the ferry building before picking up my sandwich) so I didn't get to eat it until today for lunch (2 days later). No surprise...it was still good!!! I burnt the sandwich while I was toasting it earlier so it had a burnt flavor on the edges but other than that the chicken was really tender! The terriyaki sauce was pretty good- not too sweet. I didn't taste the wasabi though. Maybe because I added mustard on it. Overall I was pretty impressed bc I'm not usually a fan of chicken sandwiches (it was the only meat sandwich on the free list) I was also surprised that my sandwich wasn't soggy, even 2 days later. YUMZ! I heard Ike's place is in Palo Alto now! Yay for it being closer! The SF location was small (I heard it was even smaller before) and there were NO tables, just a long bench for people to sit. So this place is great if you just want to get and get out.
My god this place is amazing! My boyfriend and I came here 2 days in a row and got the same thing because we were hooked. I got the nacho boy and BF ordered the menage a trois, both on dutch crunch. They were exceptionally good! The best sandwiches of our lives. For $11.99 you get a large sandwich, chips, and a lollipop. Everything is good quality and delicious! On the first day we went, we stood in line for about 10 minutes and waited for our sandwiches for another 10. The second day we went, a Friday, we called ahead. I'm glad we called ahead because they told us that the next pick up time was an hour after we called. It's still worth the wait because it is incredibly good! SOOOO GOOD!
The sandwiches here are delicious. They have more than 20 combinations to choose from. I had number one, which had halal chicken breast, wasabi mayo and teriyaki. The sandwiches also come with lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, pickles and the special "dirty sauce". The wait was around 15 min, and a staff came out with the sandwiches, and called out names of customersThe first bite was mouthwatering and delicious. All the sauces blended well together, and the chicken breast was really tender and juicy. The sandwich is definitely big enough for two to share, or perfect on a hungry day. There are comfortable white sofas for customers to sit, and enjoy their sandwiches. Also, each order comes with a pack of dirty chips. Note: you can always call in and order the sandwiches if you don't want to wait, I hear the place can get pretty packed at times
Main points:- Above average sandwich place- AMAZING chips with the order- Dutch crunch is a must- Order came with a caramel apple lollipop- Expected more from the halal chicken- Ordered the Elvis Kieth. Great wasabi mayo, but not much wasabi taste.- Saucy sandwich may get messy and take away from the Dutch crunch
Awesome sandviches, decent prices. Sometimes drop down for a quick lunch .
Once in a great while I will grab a couple sandwiches from here and bring them home for a dinner surprise. A surprise, because Ike's sandwiches are an adventure every time. If only there was a bit faster way to get a sandwich (maybe add a few bodies behind the counter during peek times?). Not to mention the Zappo's chips varieties. Dill pickle, please!
I had the Say Hey from Ike's today. I swapped the Swiss cheese for Pepperjack, and had lettuce, tomato, pickles, onion, and banana peppers added on. The Dirty Sauce comes normally on this sandwich. THIS WAS BY FAR THE BEST SANDWICH I HAVE EVER HAD. I told myself before eating that I'd save half for lunch tomorrow, but that didn't happen. I just kept eating until I was about to explode. No wonder everyone loves this place, I may have a new favorite SF food spot :)
Simply a great sandwich shop!
Ike's is a victim of its own success. By the time they serve you, you're so pissed off from waiting in line that you don't enjoy their admittedly good (not great) sandwiches.
THE BEST SANDWICH I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!!I don't know what is even in the dirty sauce, but it's phenomenal stuff. My girlfriend and I had heard about all the hype, so we literally got off the plane at SFO, took the BART and proceeded to walk 30 minutes dragging our luggage to Ike's. Upon arrival, since it was a Saturday, we had to wait a whole hour to get our 2 sandwiches. SO WORTH IT! Seriously, there is a reason this place is hyped. I was in San Francisco 3 full days, and I ate three Ike's sandwiches. It will be my first stop next time I go back.
Killer sandwich. Seriously - the bread and "dirty sauce" (which comes on all sandwiches by default) are just awesome. The ingredients and preparation are terrific as well.I highly recommend using the iPhone app to order your sandwich (about 1 hr in advance) because then you don't need to wait in line at all!
Holy Moly Batman.I don't think I can ever look at another sandwich shop the same again. I've heard of Ike's from friends and when they had all the drama going on with their location, which made them move shops like three different times, yet it took me a year of living in the city to finally find my way here. What was I thinking putting this off? One quick glance at my Yelp app and I knew the Menage A Trois was the way to go. Menage A Trois on a Dutch Crunch with lettuce and tomato -- done. Add in some Zapp's regular kettle chips at the suggestion of the guy at the register and with a swipe of my credit card, we went outside to wait for our lunch.About 5-10 minutes later, I got my Menage A Trois (complete with a "Thanks from Ike's" note on my baggy) and my friend got his Spiffy Tiffy.We decided to head to Dolores Park to enjoy our grub and it was like Heaven. My friend was quite satisfied with his Spiffy Tiffy... And didn't know what he was missing out on until after he got home and bit into the other half of my Menage A Trois. I, on the other hand, was thoroughly enjoying every single bite of my Menage A Trois. A lot of it has to do with the sauce, melted cheese, and tender meat, but it's the entire combination including the sturdy Dutch Crunch that just seems to absorb all the juices and melt in your mouth and the tomato and lettuce that adds that little extra texture. After one half, my taste buds were so satisfied there was just no need to make myself uncomfortably full with the other half. After enjoying a few bites of my baggy of Zapp's New Orleans Kettle Chips -- which were just as tasty as the guy at the register implied with his suggestion -- we packed up the rest of our food and made our way down the hill of the park.I can't stop raving about this place. It's every bit of amazing as everyone says. Don't mess with the others unless you've been here before and want to start branching out. However, if you're going to hit up this place for the first time or you're only in the area for vacation, get the Menage A Trois. Bring extra napkins, but you won't be disappointed.Would I return? Yes. Heck, yes. I'll admit, it is a flavorful sandwich and maybe a little heavy to make it a regular meal, but it's a savory treat I won't turn down.P.S. Caramel apple pops come with your sandwich! Reminded me of those days way back in middle school...
Nom nom nom!Great sandwich place in SF. Yes, of course, there's a line, but you can order and pay online/over the phone and pick it up with no wait!The Heath Ledger is amazing!!! Nom nom nom! # vegetarian review
I love this place more every location I go to! i take tourists here for cheap delicious lunch. Its all about the Pocahontas, and the Peg Bundy
Have had their sandwiches twice now, once it magically was delivered by the lovely Susan L. and another time (yesterday) I dropped by in person.First off the guys making the goods and working the register are really nice, no negative vibes here. Second the sandwiches are damn good, the ingredients are premo. Amazing bread, turkey that looks and tastes like turkey, etc. I've had the Tony Soprano and the Going Home for Thanksgiving both were great, though I liked the Soprano better (I'm partial to Italian subs). Fries were also a nice treat, they had a spicy seasoning I enjoyed and were obviously house cut (big and chunky).Drawbacks? Well seating is limited to just a handful of little tables and it's outdoor only (so dress warm in this weather, brrr!).Looking forward to coming back soon!Disclaimer: Ike's is a Yelp sponsor and I work for Yelp.
If you can find a way to get here when the line isn't too long you have to do it. I can't get myself to stray away from the Change since it never disappoints.
NEVER EVER LEAVE AGAIN, PLEASE!I've only been here once, I would go every day if I didn't live so far :( My first experience was great. The line was up till the doorway which was good because I know the line goes past the doors especially during lunch hour. They handed us the menu while we were waiting in line (BTW; Be kind and not take the menu with you out the door). Me & my boyfriend ordered the Jim Rome which has turkey, their red pesto (which is fucking delicious!), avocado & cheddar. It was absolutely delicious and their red pesto is my all time favorite now, I wonder what's in it. This tasty sandwich cost $10+ tax. Expensive sandwiches that is fer sure but it's worth the money. I suggest anyone who comes here with their partner must get their own sandwiches because I was craving another sandwich since me & my boyfriend shared. :P BTW, the sandwich's come with kettle chips ! :D
Ordered the Lincecum sandwich. It was pretty good. The bread is one of the best tasty breads I've tasted and freshly made. The sauce is awesome and it wasn't dripping in sauce. The amount of meat and stuff inside is very scarce considering how much the sandwich was. One or two slices of meat? Well overall the sandwich was really tasty.The service was not so great. So going in, there's a sign that says online orders and vip members (express) to the left and regular line for other people. No problem with that. Go to the regular people line. There's only 1 cashier that's helping some couple ordering. A family walks in and heads straight to the left and orders. Then more ppl do... did i get the short end of the stick for reading or do all these people have vip cards that they don't have to show? I should've been illiterate and went to the express line. Parking's a bit hard to find in this place. Quite a few people just double park outside and send someone in to order sandwiches.
The bf and I woke up on a Sunday morning and he suggested that we go to Ike's to get a sandwich for lunch. I'm not a huge sandwich fan, but I eat what he desires. So we headed down, parked the car and walked into a crazy mess of a sandwich shop. A little confusing at first but we found our way to the register to place our order. I ordered the "Chipper's Fav"- tuna, avocado and american cheese; he ordered a meatless chicken sandwich. Sandwiches come with a bag of chips (kettle baked in a variety of flavors). We waited forever for our order. Bf ate all of the chips because he was hungry while waiting. The wait is ridiculous. I remember the first thing i said once we got our sandwiches, "this better be the best God damn sandwich i've ever had". I think God was listening. Both were excellent and the toasted bread was what made the sandwich perfect. The thing is huge so bring your appetite. The meatless chicken sandwich was surprisingly good. Tasted just like chicken! I highly recommend phoning your order in advance. It'll save on wait time. Or come during the weekday at non-peak hours. Recommend trying at least once.
I had lived in San Francisco a year before someone suggested trying Ike's. I am hooked. My only problem is that I'm so hooked on my usual, I'm not sure I'll ever be able to try anything else.I absolutely love the Spiffy Tiffy with Jalepeno Poppers on sourdough. Yum.... so good. I recommend getting here right around 11:00 am or after 2:30 pm. Prepare ahead: bring a blanket and enjoy your sandwich in Dolores Park.
No wonder their score is a 5 star ....ikes place rules... their sandwiches are one o a kind....any veggie paying a visit....don't miss "meatless mike"....I tried the pilgrim as well.... but will not recommend it unless u have a sweet tooth....add the jalapeno poppees as the stuffing.... boy u'll be stuffed...
Great food
You know a sandwich is good when you stop by after you just ate a meal somewhere else and it is one of the best things you've ever eaten. I can't imagine how good it would have been if I had actually been hungry. My fiance and I split The Damon Bruce. I will have dreams about this sandwich. There is only one other sandwich that I have dreams about.This will definitely been our first stop when we go back to San Francisco. It was so good, we will plan our next hotel stay to make sure it is somewhere very close to this place for easy access.
I'm going to be honest here, the one and only reason I wanted to eat at Ike's is because it appeared on Man V. Food. That's it. It's out in the open. I'm not holding any secret back. Period.Now when this amazing little samich shop appeared on the show it was in a building with a blue store front with humongous signage above the door. Sadly it isn't like this anymore. Now Ike's is located in the front of a place called Lime. Not knowing this we walked past it at least ten times before realizing the chalkboard in the front with an Ike's Place sticker on it. We stood in front of this board awkwardly looking over the overwhelming amount of sandwich concoctions before one of the workers came out and handed us a full menu. Oh boy, this little menu had about ten times the amount of choices.This night kinda sucked because there was a private party (New Year's Eve) in Lime so dine-in was out of the question for Ike's. Eh, whatever I was just there to try these magnificent sandwiches. I ordered the Tony Soprano (with turkey, ham, salami, Italian dressing and provolone cheese) along with the free bag of chips. After waiting outside for our sandwiches our hunger really started to set in. Every customer that got their food before us was in serious danger of loosing their grub to us. With a huge puddle of drool at our feet, our food finally came to our hands. Then the clouds parted and a ray of sunlight shined upon us. Well not really. But it seemed that way.I'm not a caveman, I like to sit down while I eat. That being said, the search for an open bench began. After walking down Market Street a couple blocks we finally realized that San Francisco isn't too kind to those that order food to go. And by that I mean there's no freakin' benches anywhere. This was one of those moments that my Critical Thinking professor would talk about when I was drifting in and out of sleep in college. That being said, I started thinking critically. Then that beam of light I mentioned earlier shined down once again. This time it landed on the front stoop of someone's apartment building. Whatever. We planted our butts and began to finally dig in to our amazing sandwiches.My sandwich was probably, no wait, definitely the best sandwich I've ever tasted. The bread! The meats! Oh the glory! But the best thing was Ike's "Dirty Secret" sauce that is spread on every sandwich. I have no idea what was in it, nor do I care. All I know is that it made my taste buds go insane. When it comes down to it, that's all that matters anyway.The new location made me curious so I turned to my friend Google for some answers. I guess Ike's was evicted from their old location because the line was too out of hand and the noise was too high (I could be wrong, but this is what the article said). As of now they are waiting for a permit to go through at a new location a few blocks away. However, for the time being they are serving out of Lime. Again, all this could be wrong, I'm just going by what I read. Ike's, my friend, I will definitely be returning when you find your permanent location!

This is a go-to place if you've never been. I've noticed that its one of those places that gets 'name dropped' when non-san franciscans ask san franciscans where they should go eat. Its definitely a different kind of sandwich... I'd say... to go maybe once in a while, but the lines and crowd aren't worth making it any sort of routine, which is the only reason why i deducted a star.... I love the (i have no idea how to spell it) mon-naj-ay-tua... its delicious. oh the dutch crunch... yeaaa buddy! hehe.
W o w.W o w.Amazing sandwich.We waited 30 minutes for our sandwiches to be ready because there were quite a few people there and one of their ovens was broken.Ordered the Paradise Found (Ham, Pineapple, Marinara, Provolone) $7 and my bf ordered the Phil'er Up's KC BBQ (Hot Roast Beef, BBQ, Cheddar) $7 both on sourdough bread.We took the sandwiches back to our car, popped the trunk and sat in the back tailgate style under the shade as there were no tables left in front of the place.The bread was perfection. The ham was sweet and abundant, the provolone all melty, and the pineapple and marinara went SO WELL together. AHHHHHH I WANT MORE.I didnt even steal a bite off my bf's sandwich as I was very content with mine. He polished off his in a jiff and he's picky so it must've been good!I need an Ike's down here in the OC :(Each sandwich also came with a tootsie pop too, which I thought was cute.
#55 "Lincecum" -- Best ham, turkey, avocado & Havarti on dutch crunch sandwich I've ever eaten! Seriously, it's such a common sandwich, but yet it's the best I've ever had of that style. Bread was soft, but still had a crunch to the outside of it. Whatever sauce they used in it was pure amazing and the meat was so fresh I swear they slayed a pig and turkey after I ordered. Ike's is definitely a place for every out of towner to try and great spot for everyone who lives in the area. Cool sandwich names, friendly and upbeat staff, clean and colorful shop, and always a big crowd waiting to get a bite to eat. Be bold, order something crazy and see if you like it. Prices are more expensive than usual sandwich shops $7-$12, but portions are filling and experience is one of a kind. Located a few blocks from Dolores Park so make sure you walk over and bring a sammich to the park!
PRO's: Amazing sandwiches! Great variety. Crunchy, crusty bread is phenomenal. CON's: Can be very heavy with the various sauces, cheese and the garlic aioli they spread on all their sandwiches. Ask for it on the side or go light. They DONT take phone in orders between 12-2pm, which means that you have a long wait in line, then for your order to come up.
I am an addict. I plan going to SF not to see the sights, but to eat at Ike's. I could see stuff while I eat the best sandwich ever! Last time I went I ordered 2 sammie's the first day (Nacho Boy and the Change). FYI Ike's is closed on Sunday. My friend didn't know that Ike's is closed on Sunday. Her facial expression looked like her dog just died. The last day I ordered 5 sammie's. I needed to bring some home. Ike's is that good. Tip: Order your sandwich on a Dutch crunch with extra dirty sauce. Just order any sandwich that sounds tasty or do what I do and get a couple. Happy eating.
good, but sometimes the sauces can be too sweet. this is coming from a person that doesn't have a huge sweet tooth.
I love Ike's. I can't help but compare every sandwich I eat to an Ike's sandwich. I have yet to find a decent comparison. I'm sure all of the sandwiches here are delicious, but I always end up gettning the Hot Mama Huda and the Menage a Trois. I also love how evety sandwich comes with a caramel apple lollipop!The only reasons why I give it a 4 out of 5 are because of the prices and limited seating, otherwise everything is on point!
The best sandwich in the world. I know, everyone says that. But seriously, read the highest reviews on this site and BELIEVE THEM.Ike's catered my wedding, and we could not have been happier. I'm not going to go on and on; others have been as articulate as I could hope to be. Just GO THERE and enjoy!
This place is absolutely as good as it gets. The best sandwiches I have ever had. They are definitely a calorie bomb, but what a treat. My 3 favorites are the Jaymee Syrwich (add bacon), Hella Fat Bastard, and the Spiffy Tiffy. If you aren't sure what to order, get the Jaymee Syrwich on dutch crunch with bacon and you will be absolutely blown away. Although Blue Barn's Kickin' Chicken sandwich definitely gives Ike's a run for its money, you cant beat the original Ike's. This place deserves 6 stars.
Boom town!
I am a sandwich fiend. I love all kinds and I crave them like no other. You can only imagine how difficult it was for me to order when their menu boasted 200 different kinds!I finally narrowed it down and got The Backstabber (Chicken Breast, marinated Artichokes, Provolone and Caesar dressing) with extra Dirty Sauce and Avocados on French Bread. I originally wanted it on Dutch Crunch but they were out for the day (around 3pm on a Monday) and I skipped out on the veggies because I didn't want them to get soggy (I was planning to eat my sandwich later). Fast forward to 2 hours later and I'm sitting in SFO with my BF, waiting for our flight back home. We bust out our sandwiches and OMFG, it was soooooo goooooood. Like, unbelievably good. I had high expectations for Ike's and not only did they meet them, they went above and beyond them!! My BF ordered The Elvis Keith (Chicken Breast, Swiss, Teriyaki Sauce & Wasabi Mayo) which he loved as well. He actually preferred my sandwich over his and I was happy I ordered the better item for once (he always does and I feel guilty mooching off his food haha). This sandwich haven is top notch and the prices are such a good deal, I love how each order comes with a bag of Dirty Potato Chips! BTW, there was no line during our visit (Monday afternoon) and the service we encountered was friendly AND efficient. 5 stars all the way. Definitely coming back here, thanks for the awesome sandwich Ike's!!
Ike's Place is my favorite sandwich shop in the city. Their sandwiches are really creative and delicious, and SUPER filling. I usually like the Pizzle on dutch crunch and it always hits the spot. Definitely call in your order before you get there, or else you'll be waiting for an hour. Their vegan/veggie sandwiches are also delicious and you really don't miss the meat.
These sandwiches are quite something! I was totally amazed by how great these things are. I actually found out that apparently they're making a new one in LA soon! I can't wait! And sorry.. I don't remember what sandwich i ate, but from what i hear, they're all very very good!
Wow. Ike's sandwiches are absolutely amazing. Maybe the best sandwich I have ever had, whenever people visit me from out of town we often end up eating here. Highly recommended.
Errrmaaaahhhhgggeeerrdddd!I think that's what I said when I opened up my sandwich. The thing was massive and filled with so much goodness that I'm glad that I got to experience the famous Ike's sandwiches. I ended up getting something that I couldn't pronunce...the Lincecum...it was on the crunch bread and it had ham, turkey, sprouts, avocado and havarti cheese. I decided to go all the way and add some fried mozzarella sticks to it. Let's take a pause...IF YOU DO ANYTHING...ADD THE MOZZARELLA STICKS TO YOUR SANDWICHBack to our review...It was darn good...wait, it was slap your momma not once but twice darn good. My best friend loved his sandwich as well although he thought the sauce on his was really spicy. The best thing was the happy ending of two Apple Caramel suckers that were in the bag. Definitely recommend and don't forget...ADD THE MOZZARELLA STICKS!
Just when you think these people are in line for the Air Yeezy 2 shoe release, it's actually for a sando. Their sandwiches are below average, and their prices are above average. WTF?
Sandwich genius!
You have to try the Paul Reubens. Wow. Wow. Wow. One of the best sandwiches I have ever had. It didn't hurt that it came with a bag of chips and a caramel lollipop too.Service was fast and friendly here too. Can't wait to try the King Kupa when I'm back in SF!
I know it's been said but it bears repeating...delicious and creative sandwiches...wonderful bread, friendly staff, cool vibe...the wait is what you would expect at the times of day that you would expect it....just take interesting people that will keep you amused and you won't even notice the wait...if you don't know anyone like that...you will be sure to find some there and can make new friends =)
Went there for lunch today . I love Ike's . I really do . Today way different . The menu on the wall is short . You have to look up the full menu online . My favorites are not on the wall for easy ordering . It seemed like it was playtime for the staff in the back and I am not knocking the playfulness , just there was a long line and it seemed like it took forever to get my sandwhich . People well after me were ordered and put the door . I realize that some sandwhich eps are fast and others take longer. Just it seemed odd . The guy 2 behind me ordered. The same sandwhich as mine and he was in and out . I eat here often and it seems really " different " now . Strange. I like the full menu on the wall , not having to look it up and then order . Technology I guess ?
Ike's was featured on Man vs. Food. Just got back from my first Ike's Place experience and it was like no other restaurant I've ever been to.Although the line to order was about 15 people deep, I got through to order my sandwich in less than 10 minutes. Ike's has a very extensive menu of unique sandwich options. It was a tough decision, but I decided to go with the "Hot Mama Huda". The "Hot Mama Huda" had Franks Hot Sauce, ranch, provolone, and halal chicken. It also had the special "Dirty Sauce", tomatoes, and lettuce, which are on every sandwich.You have a choice of five breads to put your sandwich on. I decided to go with the special "Dutch Crunch" bread, and it was very good. It took me 35 minutes to get my sandwich as it was very busy. There were dozens of people waiting for their sandwich the entire time that I was there. Ike's is a takeout restaurant only, as there is nowhere to eat your sandwich once you get it. I'd have to say that this is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The "Dirty Sauce" gave it a very unique flavor. The bread was fresh, and the sandwich had a perfect combination of ranch and hot sauce. It had a good buffalo wing flavor to it. The chicken was also tender and juicy.I can see why this place has such a loyal following. The sandwich was definitely worth the wait. Extensive menu, great food, and unique menu and restaurant, gives Ike's five stars.Can't wait to go back to try the other sandwich combinations.
The sandwich is great but the line is retarded. If you're bored with nothing to do and not that hungry, stop by and grab a sandwich. By the time you get to the front of the line, you definitely will be hungry enough to finish the huge portion size they dole out.
Nothing feels quite like coming home as much as a trip to Ike's for a celebratory Vegan Pilgrim sandwich. Thanksgiving is number three on the list of my top 5 favorite holidays, and I get to celebrate it year round with this choice combination of vegan turkey, cranberry sauce, and sriracha on perfectly toasted, fresh-out of the oven, fluffy-but-not-too-fluffy whole wheat bread. I always tell myself I'm going to order something else off of this awesome, veg-friendly menu, but my taste buds thwart my efforts every time. Just the thought of this sandwich makes me drool.Even if you order something besides my favorite menu item, you've got to give this place a try. It's great for vegetarians and vegans (all menu items give you the option of substituting faux-meat and vegan cheese) and the service is fast and friendly. Don't count on finding a place to sit though, the place is usually pretty packed. The sandwiches are also BIG, so plan accordingly. Ike's, I'm thankful for you.
Ike's "Hella fat Bastard" is my favorite! But I'm attempting to start to try different ones as I have a feeling that my list may expand. Their "dirty sauce" is just so craveable!
HUGE sandwiches. I got the Paul Reubens on Dutch Crunch with mozzarella sticks stuffed into it. Pretty delicious but sadly the mozzarella sticks didn't add much. They weren't as melty as I was hoping!The sandwich was still great. It lasted me two meals. And the guys taking orders knows his sandwiches for real. Eat your sammy in the park!
When Ike came out to hand us our phone-in order, it was like meeting a celebrity. Does Ralph greet you every time you shop at Ralph's? Does Arby personally hand you your sandwich when you order at Arby's? I don't think so. Ike is so happy and friendly, you just want to give him a hug. You should definitely know that your BLT is made with lots of TLC here, that's why it tastes so good! Complimentary caramel apple pops, clever sandwich names, this is as endearing as sandwich-eating gets, my friends.Definitely recommending phone-ing in your order ahead of time. The wait can get really intense, it's something that you should not attempt while hungry. The website is super awesome, helps you filter out ingredients and gives you suggestions if you're a first-timer, paving a really clear path to unequivocal deliciousness!
The halal chicken sandwiches do not contain real pieces of chicken but rather shredded finely chopped chicken then mixed with multiples sauces to the point where you can't even identify whether it is chicken or tuna fish. The dutch crunch is good bread but even that goes soggy when facing the sheer amount of mushiness. The wheat bread is delicious and holds up really well. The menage a trois sauce is intensely sweet and overwhelming. The curtis was better but I just could not get over the chicken mush the texture is stomach churning. I wish I could give it another chance with vegan choices and I love that they sub vegan cheeses. Sorry
Wow. Just wow. I never thought a sandwich place would be so epic until I came to Ike's. This place was sitting in my bookmarks folder for over a 2 months until I finally decided to step and and make the trip. From what I read and experienced, the wait for a sandwich at Ike's can be grueling. Luckily, they have an iPhone app that you can order your sandwiches and schedule your pick up on. Ike's is located right on Market St so good luck finding parking. I took me 15 minutes to find parking 3 blocks away which isn't bad considering I had to wait an 1.5 hours for my sandwich. I decided to get the Menage a Trois which consisted of halal chicken, honey mustard, BBQ sauce, and cheese). Jesus christ right? Sounded pretty epic to me. The sandwich itself cost about $12 which is kind of expensive, but wow it was god damn tasty.AWESOME sauce on the Menage a Trois. That sandwich must have had some crack sprinkled in it because I literally inhaled it. I also did have half of a Jerry's Big Meat Sandwich. In my opinion, that one was good, but it wasn't amazing. It kind of tasted like a salt overkill, plus it didn't have the epic sauce.Ike's, I never thought that there would be a sandwich place that would wow me like this, but I am forever sold.
Ike's is the sandwich place! no where else compares and a Lincecum on Dutch Crunch is what I always get. Definitely recommend
Best place to get a sandwich!!! I loved the dutch crunch bread with turkey, cranberries, and all of its matching dressings. It gets pretty busy at lunch so I would plan accordingly.
Yes, 5 stars for Ikes! I'm sure at this point everyone has heard about Ikes from watching it on TV, word of mouth, and just from living in San Francisco! I've been to both the San Francisco location and the one in Redwood City, and they are both great locations. Luckily when I went to both, there wasn't an extra long line, but I've heard that it can get long during peak hours. They have unique names for their sandwiches, which totally makes this place a San Francisco Staple! I promise you, anything you order here will not disappoint. I've had the Matt Cain, and all I can really remember was that it the toppings were fresh, the dressing they put on it was flavorful and the meat was extremely savory! We took the sandwiches to go and went to Delores Park (which isn't too far away) and ate our sandwiches there in the afternoon sun.
All the reviews about the wait time scared me, so I ordered ahead through the app for a Thursday lunch. Came around 12:30, and saw that there only like 3 people inside... Anyway my friend and I shared the Name of the Girl I'm Dating (which is listed under "Bella" that day on the app - this took me a while to figure out). It was SO yummy, I love the choice for halal chicken! I'm not a huge sandwich person, but this one restored my faith in sandwiches.
There will always be a long line, so call your order in before you go. Service is friendly and they are always willing to recommend their favorite sandwich(es) to you so make sure to ask! The Halal Chicken used on a lot of their sandwiches is SO delicious and made in-house. Each sandwich comes with a bag of chips and a sucker. I wish I could try all of the sandwiches at Ike's! (There are a LOT.)There is no place to sit (only a few seats inside and no tables), so definitely get your sandwich to go. Ike's has had problems with its neighbors complaining about all of their customers sitting on stoops.
The best gluten free sandwiches I've had.Their gluten free bread is very similar to Dutch Crunch, staff is Friendly and fast despite the huge line, and the food is great.
The sandwiches here are magical. The menu takes a while to read, but everything I've tried has been delicious.
I tried this place for the first time a couple of weeks ago and I have to say WOW!! I cant remember the name of the sandwich that I had but it was really good! Talk about a hearty, filling meal! Im ranking it four stars simply because of the location and how busy they are, but definitely not because of the food. Tasty, creative sandwiches! Thats all I have to say! Just one caveat... do not eat ANYTHING before having one of these! lol!!
Cool, eclectic, unboring with truly delicious sandwiches by any standards. Love the abundance of Avocado and delicious sauces and dressing. If you have never been, you have got to go to one of the several items in and around the Bay Area.
wow Ike. I don't know who you are, but damn, your sandwiches are all that and a bag of chipswhich, btw, are included with your sandwich; could it be possible to say that your bag of chips are all that and a bag of chips too?the matt cain has me craving sandwiches in my sleep. layer after layer of delicious meat. I couldn't even recollect all the diff layers as my mind turns to mush when thinking of that mf*ing godfather sauce. so good, I wanted to knock Hoang T. out so that I wouldn't have to share my dang sandwich. I only found out who Matt Cain was this weekend, and goodness, I am a newly converted Giants fan. there could not be anything bad about a man with a sandwich like this named after him.the menage was good as was the dirty sauce, but it doesn't hold a candle to the matt cain. perhaps it was bc our chicken was a bit dry? either way, I would definitely return, but I can't guarantee I will give the menage another try as that will only take up precious stomach space from the consumption of the matt cain.matt cain, be mine *hearts*
First Yelp review, and I'm so glad it was an amazing place!I found this place on Yelp and decided to check it out with two of my friends. We got there around 7:00 p.m. on a Saturday night, and found that the line wasn't too horrendously long. We ordered at 7:15 p.m.; I got the nacho boy (roast beef, swiss, mushroom, avocado) with everything. Very disappointed to find out there was no avocados (Ike said there was only under or overripe avocados left) so that was a bummer! Be prepared to wait awhile for your sandwiches. I'm not sure if it was because some people before us ordered four, five sandwiches each, but we had to wait 30 minutes before our sandwiches were ready! With that said, it was absolutely worth the wait. My sandwich was DELICIOUS-- especially the dirty sauce. I don't know what's in there but it's absolutely heaven! I definitely want to come back soon to try the other options on the menu-- the variety is endless!
I don't know about y'all... but I go big or go home.My roommate and I both decided to get the Kryptonite ($20) each for dinner one day:Avocado, Bacon, Beer Battered Onion Rings, corned beef, EXTRA Pepper Jack, Ham, Mozzarella Sticks, Pastrami, Pesto, Roast Beef, Salami, Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers, Turkey It was a BEAST of a sandwich, so much of a beast that it came in two parts (labeled Kryptonite Part 1 and Part 2). It was delicious. I'm so glad that there isn't seating there because it was a messy sandwich. My roommate and I ended up stuffing our faces with gluttonous joy in the darkness of a street-parked car in the starry night light- so no one would have to witness us having avocado, bacon juice and dirty sauce drip all over our hands and faces. I have to say, the best addition to the sandwich were the Mozzarella sticks. It's such a weird idea, but it works. Trust me.We saved our sandwiches for 3 meals after that night, I still ate it even when the avocado turned brown. I only realized / tasted how salty the sandwich really was the day after.The Kryptonite is not for the faint of heart (esp for the high blood pressured).P.S. Now that I think about it, I think I just go big AND go home, cuz we just felt so gross afterwards to do anything else really.P.P.S The one other sandwich I've tried was the Menage a Trois but at the Cupertino location. It was pretty good, but not amazing. The Cupertino location doesn't give you free Dirty Chips like this SF location, so they lose brownie points with me.
These are great sandwiches. Very big, definitely big enough to share. They definitely pile on a liberal amount of avocado on the sandwiches that offer it. I prefer the Lincecum. Very good. What makes these great sandwiches, is the crunch bread. I have no clue what crunch bread is but it is awesome. Ike's offers other varieties of bread, but whatever you order, order it on the crunch bread. Enjoy and take a lot of napkins, you'll need it!
Thanks to a 2-for-1 birthday sammich offer that Ciara G got, she, Amy B and I got all this for $24.19:3 bags Dirty Potato Chips2 canned sodas3 Caramel Apple lollipopsMe: Jeries' BIG Meat Sandwich - I chose their awesome dutch crunch bread to layer roast beef, pastrami, salami, turkey, ham and jack cheese and all the condiments and veggies (extra dirty sauce, mustard, lettuce, tomato, red onion, peppers and pickles). What a yummy, warm, messy sammich! The dirty sauce was garlicky and SO GOOD - and the soft bread with the crunchy top! What kind of bread IS that anyway??!!I was so into my own experience, that I saw Amy and Ciara enjoying their sammiches - but I didn't try them:AB: Pride of Castro (no ham) - on dutch crunch breadCG: (Name of Girl I'm Dating) - on dutch crunch breadAll I know is - I'm signing up for that birthday club too!
I gave Ike's a second try. At first, I was so confused to why it was the best in the bay. I guess I got the wrong kind because this time, I got the Menage a Trois with dutch crutch bread. It was good and fulfilling. I wasn't blown away, but it was simply tasty and good. If there is a super long line, I don't think I would want to wait. I called in before and just picked up, which was so much faster. The service is great and there is a huge selection, so you can never get sick of one type. No place to sit down, but you can go a block down to Cafe Sophie. They will let you eat it there if you purchase something from their cafe as well. Also, Dolores park is just a few minutes away. Great place to enjoy a fulfilling sandwich.
With almost 5000 reviews I had to give this place a try. Thanks to my fellow Yelp'ers made the experance even better. So let me repeat them for you if you happen to be reading my review. 1st call ahead! The wait on the phone is long so just immagine the line. We called ahead and were put on hold for 10 min. 2nd Get all your sandwiches on Dutch Crunch. After that its all up to you. We had the Matt Cain and Menage e Trois. Both excellent but with 5000 reviews you don't need me to tell you that! Every sandwich comes with a bag of chips and Caramel Apple lollipop. So call then run here!
Holy mother of God...I have no freakin' clue how they make the sandwiches here so amazing. I got the menage a trios (that's how it's spelled on their menu...) and it was amazing. The sweetness of the honey and sauce went so well with the chicken. I've heard good things about the Matt Cain as well.I'm a big eater, but I can honestly say that half a sandwich is pretty good for a light meal, so if you wanted you could easily split with a friend and still be satisfied (leaving room for dessert!).Btw, you get chips with your sandwich. Get the voodoo chips. My first time there, I was discussing with a friend what sandwich to get and this black dude who was walking out of the store stopped, looked me in the eye, and said "get the voodoo chips. GET THE VOODOO CHIPS!" and walked away. So I listened to him and I do not regret it at all. The flavor for the chips are like a mixture of salt and vinegar (the salty tanginess) with a variety of spices mixed in. Delicious.
Its worth standing in line and get their sandwich
I don't know what the hype is with this place. My friend wanted to come and said the lines would be long due to his previous experiences so we pre-ordered the sandwiches. When we got there, there was no line, and my sandwich bread was already soggy due to the sauce. I had the menage a trois which was good but nothing spectacular. It doesn't help that its located in the castro filled with crazy homeless people yelling at poor innocent bystanders. -1 for overpriced sandwich-1 for poor locationwould've given them 2 stars but I left the store with a cool giants colored tshirts so they deserve 3 for supporting local sports teams. WOOOO!!!!
This new location of Ike's is a lounge/bar setting giving off a modern and eclectic ambience. As I sat there waiting for my King Koopa, I realized that although I appreciate there being seats now to eat my delicious sandwich from Ike's, I missed the old location. The friendly and smiling staff is still there but It just didn't feel like a sandwich enviornment.It's alright though, King Koopa more than made up for the mood of the place. All beef soft meatballs, mozzarella sticks, stuffed jalapeno poppers and marinara sauce smeared my face as I took a bite. Messy, finger lickin' good sauce just dripped onto my shirt. There is that setting that i'm missing...I feel like a sandwich artist that uses clothing as a canvas and dirty sauce as paint.
The best place to get a sandwich in town, hands down. Make sure to check the online menu before going because they don't have the full menu in the store!
The best sandwich you'll ever eat. Period. There isn't anymore to say. The food talks for itself.Parking is a bit of a hassle, but worth the walk if you have to park down the street.
Delicious, but kind of expensive in comparison with a place like Lou's Cafe (similar ingredients and breads, but virtually half the price). However, good service, awesome lollipops to go with your meal, and a generally cool vibe.Each sandwich is really unique, and I do absolutely love their meat/veggie/vegan options. There's such great attention to detail at Ike's. The fake meat is great, as are the sauces and proportions.
If you haven't been here, you better put it in your bucket list. Some of the best sandwiches and the dirty sauce they slap in it makes even better.
Dutch crunch, dutch crunch, dutch crunch. Their sandwiches are huge so are good for sharing. They also have an awesome selection of potato chips that shouldn't be overlooked. Long wait for the Mission location, so call in and pick up and go sit in Dolores Park to eat :)
I'm not a sandwich person..but this place gave me one of the best sandwiches I've had. Yes, it's a lot of bread, but the filling DEFINITELY makes up for it. I could only get through half the sandwich! The pecan pie soda was INCREDIBLE also. The line looked long, but the wait was honestly not bad at all. I had the Spiffy Tiffy, minus the provolone plus artichoke hearts. yuuummmm. And their chicken is Halal...extra points for you Ike!! Definitely give this place a shot.
This was the place that I was most excited to try during my recent trip to Sf. According to my sister, this was the best sandwich that she has ever eaten. So I was curious to see what all the hype was all about...We called in our order to avoid the hr+ wait. Even with phoning in our orders we still had to wait for a bit. It was like a mad house here. All of sandwiches sounded so good here! But the ones i decided to try were:-"We're just friends" : really good flavor and I loved the bread-"menage a trois" : probably my favorite out of the two. Really good and flavorful!I can see why so many people come here. It was probably one of the better sandwiches that I have ever eaten, but i don't know about the best...Paseo In Seattle is still hands down my favorite place for sandwiches. This is definitely a place to hit up when you are in the bay area though. Really good sandwiches. i will definitely come back here again for some good sandwiches!
This place is legendary in SF. I was biking by one day and saw no line so I decided to try it. I ordered the Spiffy Tiffy.It's the best sandwich I've had in recent memory. Lots of avocado, mushrooms, chicken. The only issue was that the chicken didn't have much flavor on its own. It was only tasty in the context of the rest of the sandwich.I wish you didn't get chips included. I didn't want them.
I mean, so there's Sub Center in West Portal, and this place. Any other great sando shops in town? I love the staff at the Oak town Ike's - Saturday crew HOLLER!
Ike's Place is a must stop for not just tourists but locals as well. It's no doubt the best sandwich there is out there. But that depends which sandwich you get also. I'm glad I went with the most popular pick, menage a trois!It's a small shop between 16th & Sanchez, which I'm sure it's not hard to find with a long line out the door. The place itself is small so it's good for take out. And even better when you call ahead of time to place your order. But make sure to do taht at least 40 mins in advance because it does take that long! You can skip the line when you get there. For each sandwich, you get to pick a bag of chips. It depends on the day you go but there was no BBQ flavor when we went. Sea salted was something simple and not too crazy like funky fusion. |Menage A Trois| $12This is a popular option so I went with it and fell in love with it ever since. You get to pick your choice of bread and I went with dutch crunch. The bread was simply amazing warm & soft. The shredded chicken was so yummy. And I thought it was their dirty sauce that I like but it's actually the zesty orange. | Matt Cain| $10NOT RECOMMENDED! I heard it's the second popular sandwich there but it was no good to us. It has roast beef, salami, turkey, and the "godfather sauce" which made it sooo SALTY!!! I thought they'd use the dirty sauce for this sandwich too but I guess not
All I can say is -vegan cheese and gluten free bread and DOESN'T COST A DOLLAR MORE. Thank the sandwich lords.
clearly Ike's doesn't need another five star review, but what the hell, it needs to be said. Ike's is awesome. it's the kind of place you should go when you're hungry, starving maybe, and want a sandwich that is literally dripping with flavor. I got the "[Name of Girl I'm Dating]" which is avocado, halal Chicken, honey mustard, and pepper jack, along with their secret special sauce which was probably a mix of mayo and crack but incredible. I think it weighed about a pound so I might recommend splitting it with a friend.also, as this was my first visit, the staff was super knowledgeable about each sandwich when I told them I was in between a bunch of different ones, explaining each one in detail. and you get a bag of chips (many flavors) with your purchase, and in the words of my friend, who doesn't want chips with their sandwich?I will definitely be back, but I'll probably bring tupperware for leftovers.
Still the best sandwich in town. Use the iPhone app to save you time standing in line though usually it's still an hour wait till pickup.
Why only 4 stars you ask? It can easily change to 5 stars when I come here again, since I do plan on coming back to this place. When I came, I already had the mindset that I was going to get their dutch crunch bread. However, they ran out of their bread and did not restock yet. I settled and got the Jim Rome sandwich on a french roll instead. The inside of the sandwich was very good, however I have a feeling if it was on a dutch crunch roll, it would taste even better.I still did enjoy the sandwich but next time I hope they will not be out of dutch crunch!
Thank you Colleen M. for having suggested this place as a must have when visiting San Francisco. Easily one of the best sandwiches I've ever had, and boy do I love my sandwiches.All of the menu items were written up on two chalkboards posted up on the wall behind the cashiers. I love how all of the sandwiches have super awesome names. Many were current/past SF Giants players, but a few random ones here and there.My best friend got the Spiffy Tiffy while I got the Paul Reuben. We both went with the Dutch Crunch bread which is quite possibly the best bread you can ever use for their caliber of sandwich.The chicken in the Spiffy Tiffy was very lean and paired very well with the avocado and pesto sauce they used. SOOO good.The Reuben wasn't bad, but it wasn't the absolute best I ever had [pretty darned close to it though]Sandwiches were pretty pricey for a sandwich, but hot diggity dawg, it was worth it. Definitely a repeat place to visit every time I'm in SF.Ike's Place - I've been thinking about you everyday. I miss you :'(
I had the Spiffy Tiffy on Dutch crunch bread with lettuce, tomato, pickles and jalapeo - this monster is the bomb diggity!! Possibly the best sandwich ever! Between the jalapeo and salt&vinegar chips I preferred the latter. I also tried a bite of boyfriends backstabber sandwich, to which he added mozzarella sticks, and it was alright. I couldn't really taste the mozarella.Friend had the super Mario and it was so intimidating I didn't even wanna try. But, of course, I had to. It was pretty good. I'm not a huge meatball fan but it was yummy. Again, not a huge fan of the mozzarella sticks. Ridiculous wait, but service was good considering the mob of people they were trying to service. Seems like they keep moving locations, not sure why. But depending on what kind of sandwich you're looking for, this could possibly be the best sandwich shop ever.
BEST SANDWICH EVER. I've been there twice now, and I've tried their Menage a Trois, Paul Reuben, Spiffy Tiffy and Elvis Keith. Their sandwiches are pretty huge and filling, and so I feel that their price of $10 + for a sandwich is totally worth it. The Menage a Trois is hella saucy and delicious. You most definitely will get messy from eating this sandwich, or at least feel like you have sauce all over your face after you're done eating. The Paul Reuben is my favorite, though. The flavors and sauce was just perfect. These sandwiches are pretty huge. I'd suggest going with friends and trading half sandwiches with each other to try the variety of sandwiches they have to offer. Their location is a pretty hard spot to find parking. My friends and I ended up parking on 21st street. The walk isn't too bad, and it goes by pretty quick.
I normally come to Ike's when I am really hungry. their sandwiches are so satisfying. their sandwiches are big and heavy regardless it's vegan-vegetarian-meat. all ingredients are packed in one bread as much as possible. their food and service are consistant. used to get them at Lime(closed tho..) too. I normally go with vegetarian sandwiches. so far, tried Peg Bundy, Pee Wee, Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian. and always add jarapeno poppers.
BELIEVE THE HYPE Went to a Clothing Store launch party, which happens to be around the corner from IKE's. OMG, real good stuff. I ordered the Elvis Keith, oh boy. Definitely the best. sandwiches I ever eaten, plus with the homemade Dutch Crunch. The Halal Chicken is SUPERB. The best Salt n Vinegar chips around "Dirty". Chips comes with sandwich. PERFECT. Yes, they do give you alot of MEAT. plus you can order more....I didn't know what to expect, besides a long line. But for a Friday evening there was no wait. Location is cool, real easy to find. Service is great. Cool place, Nice Vibe. There are so many reviews for this place not sure what more I can say, except. BELIEVE THE HYPE I will be back along with friends to experience this CRAVE......
This place is pretty awesome. I wanted to come here because I saw Ike`s Place on Travel Channel`s "Man v. Food." So when my sister and I planned to come to San Francisco, this was one of our "must go to" spots.When we got there, we almost past it because the outside didn`t look what I remembered seeing on TV. The menu on the wall didn`t have all of their sandwiches, but when I asked the lady at the cashier if they had the Kryptonite, she happily replied, "of course!."The sandwich costs almost $20, only because it`s a very large sandwich. After paying, my sister asked me if i got to choose what kind of chips I wanted, and I told her that the girl at the register didn`t say anything about chips. So I went back to that girl and asked her about the chips and she said, "it`s a pretty big sandwich, but if you still want chips after your sandwich comes out, I`ll be glad to help you."So we sat and waited for our sandwiches to come out. My sister`s came first. She got the Damon Bruce which had thinly sliced rib-eye, A1 steak sauce, onion rings, and provolone on their famous Dutch Crunch bread.When my sandwich came out, the bag was bigger than the bag my sister`s sandwich came in. When I looked inside, it was the whole sandwich cut into fours. First response as soon as I looked inside, "OMG!" The Kryptonite has roast beef, corned beef, pastrami, salami, turkey, ham, mozzarella sticks, stuffed jalepeno peppers, onion rings, avocado, pesto, and pepper jack cheese on Dutch Crunch bread. Definitely didn`t need those bag of chips. I handed a quarter of the sandwich to my sister, she gave me half of hers, and we saved the rest of my sandwich for later.Both sandwiches are very good. Even though it`s overstuffed with a ton of ingredients in it, and as crazy as it sounds, it all works together. I give them 4 stars only because their bread shreds the roof of my mouth. Don`t get me wrong, I really like the bread, it`s just a bit too crunchy for me.
FINALLY grabbed a bite of the infamous sandwiches served at Ike's, and indeed it was quite tasty! Not too sure about the wait though...Luckily we phoned in the order and were told to pick up the sandwiches in strictly one hour. I ordered the Menage a Trois and my friend had ordered the Reuben, both on Dutch Crunch. They had a variety of chips here as well that went perfectly with our sandwiches.I really enjoyed the menage a trois - halal chicken, honey, honey mustard, bbq, pepper jack, swiss, and cheddar. I did not realize that it had so many types of cheeses in it, but all of them combined with the sauce was pretty delicious. The sauce drenched into the bread quite a bit - more than I had preferred because it became quite messy.Overhyped? I think so. Worth over $10 AND 1 hour wait? No way. But the ingredients were fresh and of pretty good quality. I think there are a lot more sandwich shops in San Francisco that are less expensive without sacrificing quality, and with a more reasonable wait time.Good to try though.
Caught it when there was no line. Had the #957. It is deceivingly filling and I recommend the voodoo heat chips. Saw this on man vs food so had to try.
Solid sandwich shop.This was definitely a staple for our road trip after seeing it on Man v Food and seeing all the good reviews on Yelp and hearing about it from friends.Me and my friend split the buffalo chicken sandwich (I don't remember the exact name). It was good. Nothing 5 star worthy, but good.What really impressed me was the sandwich featured on Man v Food that has everything on the menu. I forgot the name of it, but it literally has everything in it: from mozzarella sticks to jalepenos to every type of meat. I was not expecting much from this sandwich, but it was really really good. Somehow, all those crazy flavors blended together into this one piece of heaven. You got saltyness, spicyness, richness, meatyness in each bite.NOTE: this sandwich called KRYPTONITE isn't on the menu, but you can still ask for it. It's $19.95 I believe. But you definitely should not be eating this along. Good for 2-4 people depending on your appetite.Plus, we got a little Bi-Rite Creamery after a few blocks away which didn't hurt.
I really wanted to hate this place after I saw that there wasn't anywhere to eat inside, the wait was long, and the full menu wasn't anywhere to be found; but all of that was wiped away when I took my first scrumptious bite. I'm not even sure what sandwich I had. I just told the lady at the counter that I preferred turkey and avocado and she placed an order for me. The bread was amazing and the sandwich was jam packed with meat and veggies. The special sauce they used was very delicious. It had me licking the wrapping! I would definitely recommend this place. I can't wait to come back.
This place had so much hype I had to try it....I originally tried the one on Stanford's campus and loved it so I made it my quest to try the SF one.I had the [Name of the girl i'm dating] (halal chicken, honey mustard, avocado, and pepper jack) on the dutch crunch. It was pretty good.... however it still doesn't beat their we're 'just friends' sandwich or their 'menage trois' sandwich. I'm a sucker for unsuspected combinations... orange glaze? avocado? Yes please! Their sandwiches are the ones I compare every sandwich to... the holy grail of sandwiches...the one that every time i go home, i HAVE to bring one back to Irvine. It tastes just as good 8 hours later as it does right from the kitchen.the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.. is seating. We walked about 4 blocks to the nearest park so I could sit down and enjoy my sandwich and dirty chips..a plus: Adam from Man V. Food's picture on the wallsigh...ike's... until we meet again = )
I L'IKE this place, it's tummy rubbing good! Tried to call in my order as it was recommended by many yelpers to avoid the long line, but it turns out that if I ordered on phone, I wouldn't be able to get my sandwich until 1hr 7mins later so the guy told me to come in to order instead. He was right, I got there....within 20 minutes later. I left with 3 sandwiches, 3 caramel apple lollipop, and 5 bags of Dirty chips. So my advice is to call in to check with the servers to see what's the situation in store and see if ordering over the phone or going in to order is faster because phoning in your order MIGHT NOT be your best option!I got the Spiffy Tiffy and it was GOOD! The other two from my party got the Hot Mama and Hollywood SF which was also delicious and their flavors were like explosion in your mouth. But my sandwich tasted a little bit more clean and simple which allowed me to explore the flavors of each ingredient in the sandwich.I wish Ike was there because I would be so honor to have him make me my sandwich, but it was still a good experience because he had a good staff. They had a lot of vegan options. I'm wondering if I should try that next time.....should I?
DAMN. Believe ALL of the hype for Ike's.The best advice my friend gave me about this place before coming in..."Always call in your order!!!"I had to order 8 sandwiches for my group on a Saturday afternoon before we headed out to a concert and calling in the order was the best decision. I called it in and received exceptional customer service from the person on the other line. He said the sandwiches would be ready in 40 mins (understandable for 8 sandwiches) and I could come in then to pick them up.Arrived at Ike's 40 minutes later and only waited in line for about 5 minutes. When I got there all the sandwiches were good to go and they even included a bag of chips for each sandwich as well as lollipops. I love free stuff! =) I was so hesitant about even going to Ike's after hearing all the horror stories about the long lines, but I'm so glad I called in the order.I can't remember the names of the sandwiches that we ordered, but anything with the halal chicken and jalapeno poppers were a hit. And you must order your sandwich with the dutch bread. To...die...for!!! Ike's was one of the highlights of our trip while visiting SF. Simply delicious sandwiches.
Wow! Ike's has the best sandwiches in the city by far. It is pretty pointless to go into detail considering the over 5000 stellar reviews so I will give you a tip: Download the phone app and order your sandwich from there. Not only will you not have to wait in a crazy line to order, but they have twice as many sandwiches than they do listed in the restaurant. The "Say Hey" with Pastrami, Swiss, Bacon, and "dirty" sauce is one of the greatest things I've ever tasted.
AMAZING!!!!! Some of the best sandwiches in the city! They even have gluten free rolls!!!!!! This is a must stop for any sandwich lover!!!!!!!
Ike's has happily settled into its newish location on 16th Street and the lines have found it.The Cryptonite is just as popular as it's always been, though my personal favorite is anything with tuna or salmon. Always get the date crunch bread and ask for extra dirty sauce.
I'll admit, I've only had a couple of sandwiches from Ike's so I can't speak for the 1,000,000,000+ selections that they have on the menu. However, considering that everything I've had there has been amazing, I feel safe giving a 5-star rating. I had to go with the Kryptonite, the infamous sandwich from Man v. Food. A normal person can turn it into four meals. I made it into two and was busting at the seams. Honestly one of the top three best tasting sandwiches I've ever had. Pretty much every meat option available, mozzarella sticks, onion rings, avocado, etc etc etc. Surprisingly, you can identify each taste individually; perfect.Definitely going back, next time with a bigger appetite.
Pretty good sandwiches, but I'm not sure if they're worth the wait.  From time of order to receiving the food it was about 30+ minutes.  Good thing they gave us a bag of chips to munch on while we waited, we were hungry!  One thumbs up for the place is the dutch crunch bread... Be sure to get that for your sandwich. The sandwich contents seemed pretty fresh, again - just not sure if the wait in line is worth it.   There also seems to be limited places to sit to eat. All the sandwiches are automatically packed to go..  If you go when it's not busy, you might be in for a treat.
Do I really have to write why?
Sandwiches are good but some are better than others. Usually pretty quick turnaround only improvement is some of the staff are less than friendly.
Maybe I've just been ordering the wrong sandwiches, but it seems to me that Ike's &Co. may be losing their touch. I'll have to test this theory by going back to my 1st love, [Name of Girl I'm Dating]... but so far, for me, and many of my friends... the sandwiches have been quite sub-par. Not to say that I won't still be coming back.Menage o Trois - 3starsgreat for anyone who's looking for something sweet... but that's as far as it goes. We're JUST Friends - 3starsokay, but not wow. The sweet orange glaze was nice, but very subtle. Overall, it needed some textural/flavor wow-ing.M.I.L.F. (Halal Chicken Breast, Stuffed Jalapeo Poppers, Franks Red Hot, Ranch) - 4starsone of the few sandwiches I still find to be quite satisfying. Its no longer listed on the menu, nor are many of their sandwiches from when I first visited... but if you can recall them, you can order them.Going Home for Thanksgiving - 3.5starsgood combo of turkey and cranberry, but what really stood out to me was that hint of Sriracha. Otherwise, it was still missing that wow factor.I think the major reason to their downfall, imo, is the bread. I love the dutch crunch, but they are not toasting it long enough?? This may be causing their dirty sauce to also be loosing that important oomph... but really, all their sandwiches have just been super soggy and meh... major lack in textural wow. Maybe I just need to request extra toasty bread... but if they would just fix their bread, I think I'd be able to fix this review!
Long lines, but that is what is expected at Ike's. They are very popular! Rock on Ike's!
Really yummy and filling. Order online and pick up in store to avoid long lines.
Excellent menu, service, food, and gluten free options. They use bread from Mariposa Bakery, which makes excellent stuff. Nothing else like this place.
Not much can be said or written about Ike's Place that hasn't already been said or written. I will second all the reviews that have commented on Ike's vegetarian "mea"t sandwiches - they're delicious. Definitely also get Dutch crunch bread for your sandwich here. It's delightfully crunchy on the outside and tender/chewy on the inside. Bad Dutch crunch is the worst - eating bad Dutch crunch feels like rubbing sandpaper on your gums - but it is perfect at Ike's Place.
I like Ike's place. The menu is as deep as you could ever imagine, and the staff is a friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable as you could ever hope for. My biggest qualm is knowing (spoiler/downer alert!) that behind all the fun and fancy name and dirty sauce is still Sysco grade meat. Try the 666 and Matt Cain.
Like the sign says, "Woohoo! As good as it gets!"
I love Ike's! The one star is docked because sometimes the person who hands you the sandwich is kinda grouchy.
Dear Ikes,Thank you making my gluten free sandwich dreams come true. Everyone knows your sandos are the best around, but a perfect, satisfying, between-bread creation sans gluten is a rarity. Thankfully you've changed all that, and gluten free guys and gals can now have just as much sandwich fun as regular folks. Dirty chips + turkey-cran-avocado sando with special sauce? Nailed it!
Spiffy Tiffy is the only thing I;d ever eat at Ike's! The sandwiches are good (don't forget the dirty sauce), but they are incredibly messy and they get soggy in 5 minutes flat. The walk from Ike's to the Dolores Park left me with a soggy mess. Props for creativity though and reinventing there menu on the reg.
Like this place needs another review ---- it's as good as everyone says. So the lines can be long, who cares, surf your iPhone...play Words with Friends.....it's worth it.
Ranking it for what it is - a sandwich spot - it easily gets 5 stars. It's not fine dining, but it's the best for what it is in SF. The lines can be long but if you go at the right time they are not that bad. The sandwiches are expensive but they come with a free bag of chips and a caramel apple lollipop which to me makes it worth it. Also the sandwiches are really filling and most of the time I can usually save half for later. If you are going to want to save half though I would suggest going light sauce and no tomatoes so the bread doesn't get soggy.Personally my favorite is the Super Mario... a ton of moist meatballs, marinara & mozzarella sticks. Plus the Super Mario reheats really well in the oven. My second favorites are the Matt Cain or the Say Hey with added jalapeno poppers. The SF Giants sometimes is missing the mushroom flavor but they make up for it with ton of avocado & turkey. I'm not as big of a fan of the Damon Bruce as most others are. It is good but for me the steak sauce is too sweet.
I have only been here twice, and I had the same sandwich each time - it's called the "Stupid Eggplant". Even with my limited experience, I don't think it's an exaggeration to claim that Ike's makes the most delicious sandwiches in the whole wide world. The line is there for a reason.
this place is definitely overrated and overpriced. the location is pretty run down. the meat is pretty tasteless and cold. i had the menage a trois and really did not find any special taste other than the dirty sauce. the chicken was flavorless... they make you wait over 1 hr 15 mins which only builds hunger and anticipation for a great meal. too much hype not much to back it up. my brother also felt the same way. dutch crunch bread was nice though. come to NY and try some food this place would have rated 2-3 stars at best.
I Just wanted to add that Ike contacted me personally and offered me a free sandwich and drink. I think it's great that they care about each customer!!!!
Ike's is great, obviously, but I've got some beef. (Get it?)The sandwiches are basically all bread, sauce, and condiments, with a tiny sliver of substance (e.g. meat) in between it all. So it tastes good, but I'm not exactly feeling like I ate real food afterwards.I'm sure it's a lot cheaper to not put much meat in the sandwich, but for $10 I expect some actual food included.Rhea's on 19th & Valencia does this right.
Holy Hipsters! What an amazing, huge, fattening delicious sandwich! (nacho boy in this case). One sandwich is easily enough for two normal hipsters. Bag 'o chips also perfection (you get your choice). Expect to spend extra time at the gym doing penance. Yum!
A solid sandwich, tasty and good portions. Love the creative sandwich names. Overall I would definitely go back, they do put a little too much sauce on the sandwich, but other than that, definitely a yummm sandwich
Where do I start?Phone orders. ALWAYS do phone orders. Because this is not a sit down place, calling in your order ensures that you get your sandwich in a timely manner. ALSO, if you leave your phone # with them, they keep your name and order in the system. Right down to your side of peppers :)I HIGHLY recommend the Menage a trois (pardon my horrible French). The chicken and the special sauce is just phenomenal! What a JUICY sandwich. Comes with chips! Half of the sandwich is typically more than enough for me. If you don't mind the bread a tiny bit soggy, the other half is just as good for dinner.Amazing service. Great food. Convenient. It would be a shame to give it anything less than a 5.
"Can I get the Menage a Trois please?" -Me"OhHhhhhhhh Sounds Kinkayyy" - One of the workersThat's how my Ike's experience first started! To be honest with you, the sandwiches were good but not WOW. I think everyone overhyped them for me, which kinda sucks. The location is strange since they will be opening up in their own location in January 2011. Their register is located right in front of the restaurant Lime and after you order, you wait in the lounge area. Lime wasn't open yet at the time, so we got to eat wherever we wanted in the restaurant. Strange yes but then when it was closer to the time Lime was going to open, they pushed everyone to the back. Strange yet again! I didn't mind looking at the bartender setting up though. ;)The sandwich was big and good. It took awhile for them to make though. The sauce and ingredients with the halal chicken was good. Nothing beats like a wet sandwich :P . The staff were funny and nice, which made the experience good. My sandwich came with bag of chips and a caramel apple lollipop. A nice friendly touch. Reminded me of the good 'ol days indeed.I really wish Ike's tasted better to satisfy my appetite. Stupid Overhype!!! I have to admit though, Dutch Crunch Bread was pretty darn good and crunchy!
Hands down the best Sandwich place Ive ever been to. I get the #55, its pretty much amazing. The DIRTY SAUCE on the sando is just delicious. I wish they would put another Ikes like in the Haight, or on Divisidero or something further into the city. And have some outside patio too. I would love to order a sandwich and eat it there and not have to walk somewhere else to find a place to eat. But I do make sure I bring all my friends that come to visit here.
I love this place! There's usually a line, but what great place doesn't? Their sandwiches are delicious and Ike's is always a spot to hit up anytime I'm in SF. I got the Matt Cain on dutch crunch bread. Ridiculous amounts of meat and their amazing sauce (that might be made of crack it's so addictive) they put on their sandwiches is incredible.My companions split the Lex Luther. It's a 4 pound sandwich with everything but the kitchen sink... mozzarella sticks, country fried steak, onion rings, etc. This sandwich borders on insane to me with all the stuff thrown in, but every time Ike's get mentioned, these guys stare off and salivate a little just thinking about the Lex.You must try this place. It's absolutely worth checking out...especially if you're from out of town.
I had an ex-boyfriend in San Francisco who gave it to me dirty and made me moan with pleasure with every mouthful of meat....The #27 Ex-boyfriend sandwich ($10) Salami, Bacon, Cheddar and Avocado yelp.com/biz_photos/doldYet ANOTHER great tip from Ciara G and Michelle T led me to Ike's for our first night in San Fran... My son was asleep so I headed out solo to wait in line while the wife stayed in the car with the kids...the wife: "that line looks kinda long, should we come back?"me: "nah dude, I read on yelp that the line moves pretty fast..."Fast Forward to 1.5 hrs later and Im running back to the car in my flipflops because my daughter is about to pee her pants my son is screaming his head off and the wife is pulling her hair out dealing with the two while I waited in the ginormous line....all I could think was...."Man, if these sandwiches suck...I'm in BIG trouble"THANKGAWD these sandwiches were worth the wait and we ALL enjoyed our dinner! My Ex-Boyfriend had a nice stack of salty delicious salami and BACON with some great cheddar topped with avocado and the oh so special dirty sauce...delicious. yelp.com/biz_photos/dold The wife had the Barry Z ($9)which was turkey, swiss and avocado and she ate every last bite and wanted to go back the next day for more! Even got my daughter a sammie (She's allergic to eggs/dairy) a VEGAN sandwich ($8) but added BACON ($1) to it cuz she loves BACON! They kinda gave me a weird look when I added bacon to a vegan sandwich yelp.com/biz_photos/dold but were really cool about it....here's my daughters sandwich yelp.com/biz_photos/dold mushrooms, marinated artichoke hearts and soy cheese with bacon....surprisingly good!I am sad to say that this Ike's location has closed since our trip...but I am sure that with sandwiches THIS GREAT, there will be a reincarnation of sorts in the near future...hopefully a little closer to LA? just a thought...
Great food and interesting service..
Like everyone says, the wait is long. If you're craving a sandwich in the middle of town, definitely a good place to try. They have a huge selection and the staff is amazingly nice. I'd come back only if I was in the area, but I'd refrain from having to do this wait as much as I can.I tried the mushroom veggie sandwich (Something), and the chicken avocado (Just Friends), and they were both good. It has a sweet kick to it with their own special sauce and the whole wheat bread made me feel healthier... I went with all the free toppings, so that was a plus. I had to try this place since I heard so much about it and overall, it was a good experience.
I've been to the downtown Oakland location quite often. I love their sandwiches! It's like eating a full meal. The staff is always nice. Pretty fast service, but sometimes there is a line but it moves fast. I just wish it was in a more convenient area for parking but I am sure their market is mainly to those that live close, walk there for lunch or don't have to drive. This doesn't stop me from coming though. I get the Going Home For Thanksgiving sandwich and I add avocado....YUMMERS!Although there is seating outside, this is a "to go" order place. I love the Retro dcor. Man, can't wait to go back again!
I give this place two stars because the sandwich tasted good, though it could have been hotter, but they insist on putting their sauce on everything. I wouldn't mind usually, but the reuben I ordered already had thousand island dressing on it, I certainly didn't need more mayo-based sauce. I will also say that I was totally gipped on the amount of corned beef. Every reuben you ever see has a PILE of meat on it and this had maybe four slices. I don't expect big portions, but give me something people. I paid $10 for bread and sauce which certainly wasn't worth the hour wait.I wanted to like this place so much...I might give it one more try since I hate judging a place on one trip.
This is the real deal. It's a big, tasty sandwich. (I got the Change.) But is it worth a 50-minute wait during off-peak times? Nope. Next time I'd call ahead and skip the line.
I was in town for the 49ers playoff game vs. the Packers and Ike's was one of the places I designated as a must try, and I am glad I did. The Kryptonite was massive, like seriously massive! I ended up giving the other 3/4 of the sandwich to a homeless gentlemen and his dog, I bet they are still eating that thing! So much meat and bread, can't wait to visit again!
Meal: LunchRationale: Somehow we'd heard about Ike's Place (either we found it on Yelp or we'd seen it featured in an article or blog or something). Interesting sandwiches are one of my special favourite things, and it seemed as though Ike's Place could distantly approximate one of my own special favourite things, The Cinnamon Snail food truck in the New York metro area, which parks in front of my apartment once a week during the summer but which I must go without during the winter.Food: We very thoroughly investigated the menu before heading over to Ike's Place. I narrowed it down to a few I was interested in, and continued to mull it over on the bus. I chose to go with the Ugly Owl (Swiss, Teriyaki, Vegan Breaded Chicken, Wasabi Mayo), partly for the swiss and the wasabi mayo, and partly because it seemed to be the least-tried choice out of the few I was considering (I like when the underdog wins). It was good, but the teriyaki was salty and a bit overpowering. It was also sticky, which I should have taken into consideration when we ate on a bench in Dolores Park. My boyfriend got the more popular and somewhat more "normal" Blind Date (Avocado, Honey Mustard, Pepper Jack, Vegan Breaded Chicken), which I had also been considering, and which I would probably have preferred.Service/Atmosphere: I have no complaints. The process was efficient and friendly. I've read there can be long lines here, which we did not encounter.Conclusion: I really wanted to go back later that afternoon to get another sandwich. While I wasn't thrilled with mine, I knew the five hundred other sandwiches held some promise. Next time I'm in San Francisco I'd hop on a bus to pick up one of Ike's other creations.
I gather that Ike's has moved since my visit a few weeks ago, so I'll just comment on the sandwiches. Not that those need more comments, I suppose.I did Ike's kind of wrong, and I was still heavily impressed with what I got. I called ahead for a pick-up, but Justin C. and I showed up an hour late for our sandwiches. There was no problem with the friendly staff, but I imagine you're not supposed to let the best of sandwiches just sit in paper bags for an hour.We ordered a Mnage  Trois on dutch crunch and a "Say Hey" on sourdough, both of which came with bags of kettle chips. Our sandwiches probably got a little bit soggy, but goodness, they were delicious. The Mnage  Trois was just the orgy everyone says it is - Halal chicken breast with real honey, honey mustard, barbecue sauce, pepperjack, swiss, and smoked gouda, all topped off with the dirty sauce. I wouldn't even think to call this a chicken sandwich. It was a juicy, mouthwatering monstrosity with quality meat and flavors that were deeply savory and laced with sweetness. I regret missing out on the freshness of the dutch crunch, though there was nothing wrong with it as it was. The "Say Hey" was not quite as orgasmic as the Mnage, but it was an excellent, satisfying sandwich, made with plenty of pastrami, bacon, swiss cheese, and fresh crunchy greens.Ike's is a gift to San Francisco lunchers. It has such a long, promising menu, I can't imagine getting sick of the place. I see that there are a few locations in the Bay Area - if Ike and his crew are smart, they'll send one down to L.A. I'll be waiting with my mouth wide open.
My first time coming here on an empty stomach. Honestly my day didn't start out well, but the cashier's immediately picked up on that and conversed with my friend and I, and it made my day. They get along with each other and so did the customers. That is good service. There were so many people with the same name as I, so I changed my name, but no worries because they will check your order and use your last initial to pin-point who to deliver their order to. There was a 20 minute wait.As for the food, I went along with the Spiffy Tiffy on French, adding tomatoes and lettuce, a root beer, and chips (which came w/ the sandwich). I didn't like it as much as I had thought I would. I had two bites and decided I had to share it w/ other friends. The sandwich was heavy. It might have been the special sauce. My two friends downed that sucker. But for someone who isn't super into big sandwiches and is a small eater, you might want to split a sandwich.I would definitely come back to this place to try another one of their famous sandwiches, but on a day where I'm in a better mood and I'm super hungry.
Way Overrated.It's good and great to have dutch crunch as a bread option but not that that amazing.plus definitely wish you could ask to not get chips and the lollipop to lower the price.
This is my absolute favorite sandwich place in the city. So many of my friends raved about it, but there's a sandwich shop closer to my house. My boyfriend ordered one day and LOVED it (and he's a much pickier eater than I am) so the next time he ordered, he got me a chicken-based sandwich. I have never eaten chicken that good. I don't know how Ike makes it, but it is incredibly tender.The only problem is that it's so good I have no trouble downing a whole sandwich.
This place is ridiculously amazing, I highly recommend the "Menage A Trois".
I was sad to hear the old Ike's location was going to be closed, but I'm happy that they have a new SF location in Lime. I had only had Ike's at the Redwood Shores location because I never wanted to stand in the SF line. Thankfully, they have sandwich making down to a science where we didn't wait very long. The staff are helpful and friendly, one even told me to download the Matchpin app so I could redeem the coupon for $2 off our sandwich. Thanks for the tip! My friend and I split the 16th and Mission sandwich which was just the right amount of sandwich bliss to tide me over for quite sometime. I will definitely hit up Ike's and will also be using that iPhone app! Thanks guys. I still need to try Lime though.
If you don't mind the wait its a great place. I had their gluten free bread and it's awesome. Not a low cal option but always messy awesome as sandwiches go.
Love Ike's so much.Have loved it even more since they installed one on the SFSU campus! The sheer variety of sandwich choices are ridiculous and although it seems like a lot of ingredients, it all melds together for some A+ taste bud happiness.Lots of vegan and veggie options too! Even offer gluten free bread now, but no halvsies for those because the bride is a bit pricier. Ike's is a must for some sammich cravings in SF.
Not much to say. Good sandwiches. Probably too expensive. But good.
I won't lie. I love Ike's and I may even be addicted to it. The sandwiches are just so damn good. The dutch crunch bread is what makes the sandwich real special...so don't you dare think about getting it on any other bread! The sandwiches have creative ingredients with even more creative names. It's much easier to remember (and more fun to order) with names like "Spiffy Tiffy" or "Name of the girl I'm dating" rather than "Turkey and cheese" or "Pastrami with sauce". My favorites?The Cougar (not on menu): halal chicken, Frank's buffalo sauce, ranch sauce, provolone cheese, and fried mozzarella sticks. It's a superbowl party in a sandwich.The Menage a Trois: One of their more popular sandwiches. Features honey mustard, BBQ, and real honey!The Paul Reuben: A reuben sandwich with a twist: great pastrami and purple slawBut why the 4 stars? Because I will be POOR if I continue to eat at Ike's. Sandwiches will run you at least 10 dollars. At least they give you free chips and a caramel apple pop. But still. IF you can afford to eat here often, you'll have a party in your mouth all the time, especially with all that dirty sauce! Yeah!
Say hey! is for me which is pastrami, bacon and swiss if the lines not outrageous. I wonder on how many occassions Ike has catered to the 9ers cause these sure aren't your grandmothers ninny, pansy cucumber sandwiches.If your braving the line come hungry come very hungry.
This place has really good sandwiches, my favorite one is the menage a trois. It's so sweet how they give you a little candy in your bag. I have gone to the one in Castro and the one in SFSU. I think they are both excellent.There are huge lines but they go by pretty fast, and they are worth the wait. Plus they have some really good drinks. I only give it 4 stars simply because there was hardly any sitting.
Amazing sandwiches, just a tad bit over priced. Be expected to pay 10-15 per sandwich. The other downfall, no seating available. Overall, we did enjoy the food & will def be back
My sandwich was COLD and they were out of soy cheese :(There was no lineup when I went which was a plus and there were bathrooms and seats which is also convenient. But, bottom line: the end product was not acceptable.I heard they were having problems in their kitchen so when they relocate again in a few months hopefully they'll be a bit more organized!CLOSES at 7PM weekdays (turns into Lime)
I really like a Reuben with cole slaw for the crunch - this one is pretty good.
This is by far the best sandwich I've ever had! The Menage A Trois was delish, the sweetness of the honey with the BBQ, and the halal chicken was sooo good. The sandwich comes with a bag of chips, Voodoo chips were the ones I chose and it was like nothing I've had before. If you're in the area, this place is a must have!
I came here to try out their sandwich that I've been hearing was OH SO GOOD and I was definitely not let down! :) On top of a great sandwich was great service! Hands down! :)I wanted to get an unoriginal and ordered a roast beef sandwich on a dutch crutch roll with everything on it. The bread tasted sooo fresh. (The 15 minute wait was worth it.) The roast beef was so yummy and crispy. I wish I had more crisp on the ends of my roast beef but i was still satisfied. Thank God there was no line when I got there. I will be coming back again!
Do you like sandwiches? Do you want to have the best sandwich you'll ever have? If you've answered yes to either of these questions then order the Menage a Trios on Dutch crunch. Seriously. Ohh and you're looking at the menu and considered trying something else -- oh that sounds good and this sounds good. And yes, they're all good. But order the Menage a Trios first. You will not be disappointed.
I usually don't update my reviews, but I feel compelled to do so. While I still give Ike's 5 stars, this is the 1st time I've been to this "new" location. I came by right at noon yesterday, and there were only a few people in line. I was able to order within 5 minutes of walking in, which was a lot quicker than my previous experiences at the old location.After seeing the Madison Bumgarner segment on Gmag (for you non-sports fans, Bumgarner is a starting pitcher for the San Francisco Giants), I knew that I wanted his sandwich. It comes with thinly sliced rib eye beef, lettuce, tomato, cheese and a spicy bbq sauce, along with Ike's dirty sauce. When I got my sandwich, chips and drink, I walked a few blocks to Dolores Park (no tables set up inside), I dug into my meal. First of all, it's called "Dirty Sauce" because you get your hands, lips and chin all dirty from eating it. Thankfully, I was by myself, so I wasn't embarrassed to get all the sauce all over! And though I was expecting the sandwich to be really spicy, it wasn't too much to make my mouth go crazy. It had just enough of a burn to accentuate the rest of of the sandwich. Though I am partial to the Super Mario sandwich (beef meatballs, mozzarella sticks and marinara sauce), the Madison Bumgarner is my new best sandwich I've ever eaten. While the website hasn't added that sandwich yet (unless it's a "secret" one to unlock), I hope that this item is a permanent fixture!Lastly, all the staff I encountered were very pleasant, especially the woman who took my order. Everyone working seemed to enjoy themselves, which says a lot about Ike's Place!
DELICIOUS SANDWICHES! Why are you even yelping this place?!?!?! Haha , just kidding.Honestly, I"m not gonna tell you what is good what's not because all the sandwiches are delicious. They are customizable in the sense that you can add free toppings and other things in the sandwich (onion rings, avocado, extra dirty sauce, etc)If you really don't know what to order you can go on the website and select the kind of meats you like and it sort of "filters" the sandwiches for you according to what you select! There is a smartphone app so you can order via that. Or you can call in and pick up because sometimes the wait can be really long.Happy eating!
when wanting something different, I like to go to Ike's Place in Stanford. Pretty funny names for the sandwiches. If you didn't know what I was talking about , saying out loud when ordering a "Menage A Trois and Lizzy's Lips to go..." would sound odd. Besides the intersting names of the sandwiches, they are pretty good too.
Great bread (Dutch crunch) and pretty creative sandwiches. It may be the secret dirty sauce but the sandwiches are really delicious. Husband got the spiffy tiffy (chicken salad with pesto) and I got the handsome owl (vegan breaded chicken with wasabi mayo) and came with a bag of free chips. Not a bad line at 2 in the afternoon on a weekday but still about 30 mins to get food. Would definitely frequent this place if I lived here.
Name of the girl with Dutch crunch bread... Watering mouth...
MATT CAIN is always my choice..add some bacon and it is perfectionthe secret sauce is so wonderfulikes is truly a legend
Can I give zero stars? Because I would if I could. The aioli is nasty - there's nothing tasty about ingredients drenched in all that sauce. Felt like puking all night after eating here. Should have had a Whopper instead.
Baller sangwitches. All day, every day. Elvis Keith is write-home-about-it good. Anything chicken for that matter. Among the best in a place where the average is light years ahead of any major sandwich chain.
Cute cashier girl!
HOLY MOTHER OF ALL THAT IS GOOD & RIGHT IN THE WORLD!If Ike would allow it, I would worship at his feet. His sandwiches are so outrageously amazing, there are not proper words to describe the joy and exhilaration you will feel after just one bite. There is nothing I can say to you that will make you understand. You will say "Come on, Lia, it's just a sandwich!" and I will cry with frustration.There are so many options here, I'd highly recommend going to the website to get some idea what you'll order first. Even then, you'll probably see other things added to the menu once you're there. Every sandwich is loaded with flavor and the BAKED fries are so good you'll go back the next day. There's even a little lollipop served with every order (and vegan ones for vegan orders!)! Holy cow. Thanks to everyone in their right minds LOVING this place, it gets pretty darn packed. I HIGHLY recommend calling in your order. The last time I ate there we called shortly they opened and were told we could pick up our sandwiches in 90 minutes! We got there and there was a line down the street waiting to place orders, but we just walked up and got ours. It sounds like a pain, I know, but it's really really worth it- I promise.You have to eat here. Seriously. Bring me some back. No no... I'll go with you. Let's go RIGHT NOW. Oh I love me some Ike's.The Good:--EVERYTHING here is delicious--Free lollipops!--Every sandwich can be made vegan--The owner is a hottie--SUCH good service--Amazing array of choicesThe Bad:--No fries on weekends--You HAVE TO place orders ahead of time on the weekend. No exceptions. They are THAT busy!--Very little seating
I go to SFSU and the sandwhiches there cannot compare to here! The chicken just melts in my mouth and the dutch crunch bread and the dirty sauce... I think I'm drooling right now.There is a wait though, that's the thing. There's always a wait, but that just goes to show just how popular this place is.If you want to try a good sandwhich definitely try it here! I love their Elvis Kieth and [Name of Girl I'm Dating]. I wish I can come over to Castro more often to grab a bite here so if you have the oppurtunity GO!
This place was so hard to find! I had no idea that it was located inside a lounge, especially since the pictures on yelp made it seem like it was its own restaurant rather than a lounge serving their sandwiches. My boyfriend drove for 30+ minutes to find parking and it took us another 15+ minutes to find this place. We kept looking for the blue on the outside and the big picture of a sandwich, which we never found or will ever find. Gosh, were those pictures misleading!!! Thank god that our friend told us to call ahead, which we did. They said the sandwich would be ready in about 40-50ish minutes, which took us about that long to find the place, once we arrived in Castro. So, when we finally found this place, I was hoping that the sandwich would be ready, but it was not!!! I got there and I paid. The place was very dark, very typical of a lounge. But then you see a designated corner and you see everyone sitting around in the dark eating a sandwich. The designated corner was packed but seats became available when we got our food. However, eating was super difficult since there weren't enough tables. So it was kind of like sitting on a couch, in the dark, eating a sandwich. Something I've never done before. The boyfriend and I shared the superman. Our friend recommended it to us and it was so good! They put tons of meats and veggies in it and it was so delicious, but at the same time very messy since we did not have a table to eat on. For instance, a lot of my sandwich components were just falling out onto the floor. The sandwich was definitely good, which was accompanied by a caramel apple lollipop (my favorite) and a bag of "Dirty" chips. This place would have definitely gotten five stars, if only it wasn't sooooooo difficult to find!
This is more an ode to my favorite sandwich shop since they are closing in about 28 hours and 34 minutes, not that I'm counting. I decided to go for a final sammie, and got the "Get Over It" which I hadn't ever tried. Some might wonder why an untested sandwich that wasn't even still on the menu, but I like change and change is good (their sandwich, as well as in the world). And since it's inevitable I'm glad there was a good run at Ike's 0 (zero) a few blocks from my place, but I guess my expanding waistline will be thankful for the relief, and perhaps more women will find me attractive after I stop consuming so many tasty sammiches from Ike's.I do hope a new location in SF does appear. Maybe in the Dogpatch where space is available, and not a lot of annoying or potentially annoyed neighbors? Plus I work down there... oh well, we'll see! Au reviour Ike's SF!
Just meh. I was so excited to try this place because of all the hype and constant lines out the door, but I didn't find it to be anything particularly great. The toppings are cleverly named and have interesting flavor combos, but the portion size is small for the price.
No doubt about it!! Ike's is hands-down the BEST sandwich place ever, if not THE BEST eatery in SF!! The first time I came here, Ike's was still located at their old spot just around the corner from their new spot. Cannot believe it, but the bf and I waited for over 2 and 1/2 hours to place our food and get our sandwiches. We were starving little monsters and by the time we got our sandwiches, we looked at each other and said " This BETTER be good!!" and it sure was!!! It lived up to what every Yelper has noted it as, the BEST of the BEST!!! We devoured every last bit of our sandwich. We ordered the Name of Girl I'm Dating and the Menage A Trois (also known as the 3 way) sandwich. The Menage A Trois is to DIE FOR!! The halal chicken, the smoked gouda, the dirty sauce, and the dutch crunch bread is a combination of mouth watering blissfulness. Sandwiches are a bit pricey, running about $12 per sandwich, but totally worth it!!! The bf and I was just back here about 2 weeks ago and was sure glad we decided to get food from Ike's!! The new spot is literally down the block and around the corner from it's old location. Not quite fond of the new shared spot with Lime's, but good thing we were grabbing and going, since it didn't look too spacey in there to eat. This place is super super yummy in my tummy. Ike's you need to open up more locations!! Your sandwiches are sure to be a hit and moneymaker no matter where you go!! Please look into the East Bay!! Nom nom nom ... :D
Super Mario Sandwich is amazing!! I have never had a sandwich like it-like seriously, mozzarella sticks inside of a meatball marinara sandwich with mushrooms?!?!? How much better does it get? And I love the touch at the end with the Caramel Apple Pop. Highly recommended. I really need to try the other sandwiches but I simply can't get over the Super Mario. Also a really convenient spot as it is only a couple blocks away from Dolores Park.
After being on hold for 25 minutes, i realized no sandwich is worth this much effort. Oh, when the (nice) lady answered, there was one call ahead of me. Unless they ordered the whole menu, theres no need to put anyone on hold for that long. Called back to see if they forgot about me, and the answer was, "there is one caller ahead of you"... To which i promptly said "thank you" and "goodbye" and hung up. Total bummer bc i really like the food at Ikes, and Ike himself seems like a good dude. Who knew 3:00pm on a weekday would be so busy they can't take orders? I hope i can update this review next time im jonesing some of their delicious Halal chicken. I don't have any idea what 'Halal' encompasses, but its fantastic at Ikes. Dangit, now i really want a Ikes Sando! Ill probably try again this wknd...just hope i can actually order this time.
Its been awhile since I've been to Ike's and they're at their new location. Has a little indoor seating and a bathroom now yay! Looks like their menu has changed some and you can download their iPhone app to order your sandwich. This time I tried the Paul Reuben on dutch crunch. This will be my new go to sandwich. DROOL.
I generally don't like to eat sandwiches but these are no ordinary sandwiches. Love the sf giants and free chips. Tip- split the sandwich with someone and make room for dessert at tartine nearby!
The sandwiches my friends and I got were delicious. I wish there were more seats, but the park is nearby so you can grab your food and enjoy with some fresh air.
Never had a sandwich this good. The Mnage a trois was so good. Unique names and complimentary chips and candy. Worth the wait and trip to get there. Definitely going back. Friendly service. Limited seating and no tables, but that's okay. If there was seating, it would be too packed.Five words: Dutch Crunch, just do it.
The sandwiches are pretty bomb. com!!! I wished I lived to it closer, or they would open one up in Sacramento. The only thing I didn't like was the parking. It takes forever to find parking. Also, I wished they had tables and chairs to sit and eat your sandwich. I had to enjoy my sandwich in the comfort of my friends car. Everyone is very nice here and whenever I am in the area again, I will definitely come back :)
Definitely lives up to its hype.I had the Matt Cain and it was awesome, loaded with different meats and no skimping on anything. The dutch crunch complimented it with a little bit of crunch. I didn't mind the long line because you can take your time looking at the menu and determining which sandwich you wanted to order if it's your first time. This would have to be one of my favorite sandwich plates in the city.
I get hungry thinking about Ike's.I got Ike's version of a cheesesteak sandwich on dutch crunch bread. A-ma-zing. I've never been a big sandwich person, but Ike's makes me a fan. Also, I love their Dirty chips, jalepeno flavor. YUM.P.S. Ike is very kind and is actually at the shop to talk and bring sandwiches to customers.
I've been to Ike's a few times now, and after trying a couple of different sandwiches (the paradise lost and the Tim Lincecum), I have to say that the crew at Ike's definitely know how to make a sandwich. I don't mind travelling out of my way from San Bruno and wait in line for lunch. I've even got my cousin liking the sandwiches as well.After reading a couple of other reviews on here, it looks like I'm going to have to try adding the Mozzarella sticks to my next sandwich.
Not only do I love Ike's sandwiches, I may have a small local-celeb crush on Ike Shehadeh. First of all, Ike's has a great system and a consistently delicious line of products. I think many people get stuck in the rut of ordering the same item every time at a restaurant when you know that you like it. However, Ike's has totally thrown me out of that loop, and I try a different sandwich every time I go (though admittedly that isn't super often, mostly because I remain full for a week after I eat one). Ike Shehadeh is just a general badass + local robin hood-esque figure, as seen through Ike's partnering with ATC to feed homeless youth: atthecrossroads.org/2012
3.5 stars rounded upI'm probably *the last* person on earth to try Ike's...I hate hype & when thousands of yelpers profess their love for a joint, I tend to run the other way; it just never lives up to the hype.How did I come to finally try Ike's? My dad called to say he saw it featured on a food and/or travel show & wanted to try it! When your parents jump on the 'foodie' wagon, you know it's time to throw in the towel & give in to the doom. Resistance is futile at this point.To minimize the pain of going to a yelp-popular joint, the fam bam & I arrived at 10am on Friday morning. Boo-yao! No lines, no crowd & an empty window seat in an otherwise no-seat havin' place. So far, so good. I picked Going Home For Thanksgiving (turkey, cranberry, siracha, havarti) for my Wonder Twin, which she liked. My dad chose Curtis (halal chicken, provolone & marinara...he was originally going for Womanizer, but the vegan 'chicken' didn't sound appetizing to him.) My mom & I shared a Barry Z (turkey, avocado & havarti on sourdough), which was really flavorful with the Dirty Sauce.Sandwiches are huge & come with a bag of chips. $31 for three sandwiches & 2 waters. Glad the Parental Figures keep up with what hot & cool & in because I certainly don't! Ike's menu is overwhelming, but pick a cleverly-name sammich & you'll probably be pleased. I might come back to Ike's (as long as there is zero wait) but I can't claim their sandwiches are life-changing or addictive or any of those hyperbolic words. Sorry to burst your bubble.
copied from my Lucca's review:"I had the fire roasted steak caesar and it was pretty good. if anything it was big enough for 2 people. However if I had to compare it to the likes of an Ike's "Damon Bruce" ..no contest, Ike's would win. Lucca's has solid sandwiches but the sauces at Ike's are better in my opinion to that of the Lucca garlic sauce."
Hands down the BEST sandwich ever!I chose the Keith Elvis a chicken teriyaki sandwich, then I let my imagination do the rest. This starts off with all of the fundamentals, meat, sauce, veggies, then the uniqueness of Ike's shop totally takes over. I turned my chicken breast into the fried alternative which gave it extra texture allowing the breading to absorb their dirty sauce,wasabi mayo and teriyaki sauces with the honey I added to give it the sweetness I crave as well as allowing the spice to be drawn out, to give it that yin yang balance of spicy versus sweet. That was just the beginning.Next, I added the optional fried cheese sticks to top the Swiss already existing, all accompanied by fresh tomatoes, lettuce, pickles, and I elected for banana peppers which gave it a little crunchy kick in every bite. I am a total foodie so this was a mind blowing sandwich. I have not given any place five stars yet. So here is to you! I would name this the Yin Yang! Total balance with spicy, sweet,veggie and fried, in every tasty morsel!
This is the best sandwich place! There is a long wait but it's worth it. Everything on their menu is AMAZING! There is a BOGO coupon surfing around the web right now. :)
So many options!  I was a little overwhelmed the first time I went there, v with all of the selections! But once I decided on one, I was not disappointed! They have excellent Dutch Crunch rolls!! Can't wait to go back and try more types of sandwiched!
Not impressed. Really can't see what all the fuss is about. Personally, I don't need 20 incongruous items in my sandwich.
Went here two years later to show my bf how amazing sandwiches can be. I'm not a huge sammy fan but this place just does it for me.  The last time I was there I ordered the turkey, cranberry, sriracha Havarti sammy but this time I got the rib eye with A-1. I love A-1. My bf and I got into a fight once and he brought me home some A-1 and I wasn't mad anymore. I can't tell you what we did with it though. At least not on this site...j/k.But I digress. This time the dutch crunch bread wasn't as crunchy. Boo. The mix of mayo and A-1 with the rib eye and the salt and vinegar kettle chips were a good flavor combo. My bf ordered the Lex Luthor - he's insane. Its the chicken fried steak, fried chicken, rib eye sammy - he's nuts. He devoured half and called it a day - we went to the nearby dog park and chilled and digested. He even took his half sammy home with us to San Diego a day later and it was still oh so gooo-oood.Come here if you don't like sandwiches - it'll change your life.Props to the little kid at the cash register - he was high as a kite!
Amazing! Get the Dutch crunch bread.. Fabulous texture and just the right amount of sauce and add-ons. I got the "Name of the girl I'm Dating".. And it was phenomenal..
YUM! So many good options, such delicious combinations. Seriously, make sure to enjoy every single bite because your sandwich will be gone before you know it.
I love this place. Home for Thanksgiving will always be my #1 pick at Ike's, but I must force myself to try the other sandwiches there more often.
Have you ever eaten something that just RAISES the bar on all foods in its category? That just instantly makes your day, week, and LIFE much better? That single bite of that something was what you had always craved but you never knew you needed. That something lifts you up, and makes you and everyone around you a better person. I am now blissfully aware of how lucky I am to be here in this world, yet at the same time it pains me to think that not everyone in the world will be able to try the marvelous sandwiches made by Ike and his crew. Want more positivity in your life? Eat Ike's sandwiches. Want to be empowered to face your fears? Have a fresh sandwich at Ike's. Want to get lost in tasty euphoria? You know what to do.
Bomb great service and great food havent been to any of the new locations but the old was one kool and the owner is doing his thing
I have never had a better sandwich in my life. After hearing my boyfriend raving about Ikes countless times, we decided to go when I came to the Bay Area (I am from Phoenix). In comparison to the sandwiches, the building for Ikes is a little lackluster, but honestly, who really cares. It's set up in a way where you stand to order your sandwiches, wait for them, and then are expected to leave (because there is no seating inside or outside). But, this is all done in a way that doesn't really matter, because the staff is very friendly and helpful when it comes to any aspect of the shop. Anyhow, onto the sandwiches. As I stated above, I have never had a sandwich as good as the one I had at Ikes. My boyfriend and I got the Jaymee Sirewich and the Damon Bruce and we split the two- which let me tell you, if you have a normal sized appetite, is not adivised. Easily, two people could share one sandwich because they are HUGE. The Jaymee Sirewich was my favorite. The combination of the fried chicken with Ike's special sauce was mouthwatering. And, all ontop of their Dutch Crunch bread made for the perfect sandwich combination. The shredded lettuce, as simple as could be, also made for the perfect pair with everything on the sandwich, and everything blended in perfect harmony. The Damon Bruce was good too! It had the perfect ratio of sauce to meat, and the meat virtually melted in your mouth! They also have an interesting selection of chips, with a variety of flavors and brands.
Shoot... A few thousand reviews later and this place is still just as excellent. Ike's is a superb hole in the wall, with one of the most diverse menus known to existence. From the perspective of a vegan, I was happy with the menu- there are around 25 vegan sandwiches with a good bread selection, vegan chips, and even a vegan lolly-pop (the caramel apple is not vegan, whereas the Blowpops are). They're knowledgeable regarding veganism and know how to cater to your desires. This is huge due to its rarity, severity, and importance.My recommendation is... The "Vegan Captain Kirk," the orange marmalade is spectacular on the sandwich, with a close second "The Vegan Pilgrim," because anything with Sirachi is enough to send my mouth through a few orgasms. Plus, the owner is walking around most days, which is a really cool addition- you can tell he cares about his customers and really works hard to keep them happy. Good portions, relatively good prices, great menu, and very vegan friendly. Thanks for everything, Ike.Enjoy it, and as always, think before you eat.
Vegetarians: it's not on the menu, but ask for a Go Sharks! on their crusty Italian with all the extra fixin's and gouda instead of cheddar. Even if you hate sports, it'll make you fist-pump.
Good, but nothing unique. It reminds me of Board & Brew in San Diego but with more variety.I shared the Spiffy Tiffy with a friend and friends got the Menage a Trois, which they seemed to enjoy.Everyone liked their sandwiches and we ate them happily in the sun at Dolores Park.Good but not worth the hype. I may come back to try some other sandwiches, which may change my opinion.
I've eaten here many, many times and have never even pondered leaving a review because 1. The sandwiches speak for themselves and 2. I assumed since Ike's sandwiches debuted on Man v Food, there wasn't a review in the world that could do this place justice. Alas, I'm leaving my review for the #8, Phil'er Up KC BBQ sandwich, which I like to think of my little secret piece of heaven (It's not on the menu when you go into Ike's Place and it doesn't look like it's on the menu on the website), so, I'm sharing this sandwich with you.If you've ever sat in the office thinking about where to order a BBQ beef sandwich from, go to IKE'S. I've had millions of BBQ beef sandwiches (pretty much the only sandwich I consume) from local delis and none of those come close to Ike's BBQ beef.First off, let me start by saying you must get it on dutch crunch. The sweetness of the bread melts with the garlic aioli sauce and bbq sauce slathered on the sandwich. The first time I ate the sandwich, I made the mistake of eating over my lap and ended up with the sauce all over my dress. The cheddar cheese, bread and meat all melt together in one amazing goodness that is BBQ beef at its finest.I promise once you have a BBQ beef sandwich here, you'll never be able to look at the local deli sandwich the same.Below is a link to the sandwich, which I was able to find online.eatingikes.wordpress.com
Best sandwich place in SF. Even if you don't agree, it's at least the most vegetarian-friendly sandwich place in SF.
Ike's has some pretty bomb sandwiches. There are sooooo many different ones you can get and I get dizzy just looking at the menu online. I tried the Kryptonite...This monster of a sandwich was $20 and it was basically 2 sandwiches. It contained every meat imaginable: Roast Beef, Ham, Pastrami, Salami, Turkey and more. It also had jalepeno poppers and mozzarella sticks and onion rings! But I wouldn't recommend it or get this again because it was WAY too much meat. Also the saltiness of the meat overpowered any other taste in the sandwich. I tried my friend's matt cain or something. That was REALLY good and the avacado one was too. Just stay away from the monster sandwiches.
Shared the spiffy tiffy with the bf. Was a great late lunch for the both of us. I had some hesitation at first ordering chicken, because usually chicken is dry for me, but this chicken was really moist, and also mixed really well with whatever sauce Ikes was using.LOVE this place! My only complaint is I wish they had some decent seating area besides along the wall!
I really like this place! I came here two times and they both were very good experiences. You can taste so much in the sandwiches! It's like a BAM of flavor! Then they give you a bag of chips and a lollipop too! So cuuute :) The customer service was good too, the lady who ordered my food conversed with me and she was funny haha. Made my best friend and I laugh! Even tho the line can get pretty long, I'd definitely come back :D
Based on taste alone, this place gets 5 stars, but maybe drop it to 4.5 since the prices are a bit high.I don't think it will deter many people though because it is that good. Really placed in a residential area, I don't know how people originally found it. The Jaimee Sirewich is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. I don't know what they put in the fried chicken and cheese sandwich, but it was awesome. We parked next to Bi-Rite and waked up and let me tell you it was well worth it. Even w/ a Man vs. Food visit, this place is the real deal. Ike, you are a genius.
There's a reason why this sandwich place is rated 4.5 stars. As a foodie, believe me when I say, Ike's deli sandwiches are extraordinary. Frankly, all deli sandwiches have similar taste to me. What makes Ike's sandwiches different from the rest is that they use aioli special garlic sauce on all of their sandwiches and their bread is freshly made. The bread is not made at Ike's but Ike finishes the baking process which is as good as fresh. $10 for a sandwich, a bag of chips and a soda.Oh, by the way, as you may already heard or read, there's always a long line, I suggest to order your sandwich(es) over the phone. AND, an average of an hour wait when you order over the phone. YES, an hour wait after placing an order over the phone. I found this out the hard way, I was waiting for my wife outside the salon, it was pass 2 pm thinking I can order over the phone and pick up our sandwiches. WRONG, Ike told me that our sandwiches will be ready in an hour. I was so hungry but had been dreaming to get my hands on those sandwiches.Enjoy!
Lincecum sandwich!!!!NOM!I don't know what else I could possibly add to all of the reviews that Ike's already has!It's seriously a huge sandwich! I tried so hard, but I couldn't eat the whole thing. The dutch crunch bread is bomb. It's super soft. It also comes with dirty chips! Yum!
best sandwiches in the city.TIPS:1. get it on dutch crunch2. call in your order3. get it "extra dirty" (that is - if you like garlic)4. eat em ASAP. they get soggy. fast.5. top if off with a scoop or two of bi rite (i could go on, but thats another story..)like chicken? try my personal favorite "name of the girl im dating" -chicken breast, avocado, honey mustard and pepper jack cheese. DROOL. half a sandwich can suppress small appetites, bigger ones (aka my fatty ass) will suffice with the whole damn thing.Ike's please open another location. the sunset perhaps? :)
Great sandwiches , good price for what you get and a good cheat day item. Will be back the next time I need a good bite.
I cannot believe Ike's Place is leaving San Francisco. After I heard the news, I knew that I had to jump onto the Ike's bandwagon and eat up all I could before Ike and his coveted sandwich skills abandon me for the likes of Redwood Shores, Burlingame, Santa Rosa, and Stanford. Within the last few weeks, I've managed to stop by with a friend (or five) about... Nine times. (So THAT'S where my $90 went...) Each time was more delicious than the previous, and the line, though long at times, never stopped me from my nom-attaining-goals.Go there, right now, while you still can. If you hate lines, call in for a pick up, get your sandwich, and hold a napkin to the corner of your right eye as you bid adieu to Ike's, the city's best sandwich companion.My favoritesWe're JUST Friends (Halal chicken breast, orange glaze, avocado and pepperJack)Backstabber (Halal chicken breast, marinated artichoke hearts, caesar and provolone)Manage-A-Trois (Halal chicken breast, honey, honey mustard, BBQ, pepperjack, swiss, and smoked gouda)I stick by the Peg Bundy for the veggies out there. Done.Their dutch crunch bread has a crispy top with a soft middle - you won't regret it! I like my sandwiches with everything on it, so unless you don't like mayo, Ike's Dirty Sauce, lettuce, tomato, red onions, pickles or banana peppers... Get it!For those new to Ike's, the price range is around $8-$11.11 for a sandwich and a bag of "dirty" chips. Each brown bagged sandwich comes with a caramel apple lolli for dessert :)
Do you want a huge a** sandwich that will fill you up but make you feel bad about yourself because you will eat the whole thing because it tastes so good? Go to Ike's Place.But call ahead, or become a preferred sandwich eater or something because then the wait will not be so long ;)I love the VOODOO Chips!!!!
milf 100%
Hit up Ike's place after the 49er's fan fest event at Candlestick with my girlfriend. Came in and ordered the Matt Cain and the Paul Reuben. The sandwiches were on point! But the part that made our day was meeting Eriq. Its just too bad that today was his last day. Ike's will be missing out such an outstanding manager.
There are no words to explain my love for this place. Probably the best sandwiches I've ever had. I'm really sad that they got rid of one of my favorite sandwiches (Mission PZ Burger) but I still enjoy the Hot Mama Huda and the Strawberry Girl. Make sure you get the dutch crunch bread! And their dirty sauce is the TRUTH!
Ordered the Menage A Trois because of a recommendation from the cashier. I liked the sarcastic humor of the cashier as well btw. I was skeptical at first from the description of the sandwich, but that ended when I took a bite. The bread was amazing, I liked the thin crust. The sauce was great and the chicken was solid. Everything in the sandwich was good, just a really good sandwich.
I've been here before for my UYE in November of last year and had the Manage-a-Trois! This time the parentals were in town!! And if you could take them out to lunch in SF, where would you go? IKE'S of course!!!!! :D - Hollywood's San Francisco Cheesesteak (Thinly Sliced Rib Eye Steak, Mushrooms, Provolone) $9.99- Paul Reubens (Sliced Corned Beef, HomeMade Poppy Seed Coleslaw, French Dressing, Swiss) $11.99My Mom and I split the cheesesteak! And boy, that was DELISH with the dirty sauce and dutch crunch bread! I think I could've handled the whole sandwich by myself! :D My Dad's on the other hand was a complete mess!! I wouldn't recommend ordering it if you were on a hot date. It can get super messy with the coleslaw and french dressing dripping all over the place. =\ But yay! Our sandwiches came with a bag of chips for FREE!! Yummyay!!!!!I'd recommend taking your sandwiches to Dolores Park and enjoying it under a nice shady tree! :) It's always so gorgeous there! Lots of sun, green grass, and people!LOVE the dutch crunch breads! LOVE Mr. Ike himself!! He works hard to make the customers happy!! Super awesome shop, great delicious sandwiches, hungry happy people who know where to find the best sandwiches in SF!!!!! LOVE it!
I've had the sandwiches, and I like them, but I don't really get the hype.I think the owners must be really great at generating a buzz through social media and whatnot.The sandwiches are good, but I just don't see how they're that much better than any other sandwiches available in the same neighborhood.Definitely feels like an event going here though, because of the long lines.
This place makes me wish that it was legal to marry sandwiches.In the few times I've been, I've had the name of the girl I'm dating (alal Chicken Breast, Honey Mustard, Avocado, PepperJack), the vegan meatball, and the Jim Rome (Turkey, Ike's Red Pesto, Avocado, Cheddar). The meat sandwiches were hearty and the vegan meatball had so much flavor. I can't choose a favorite, because they were all SO DELICIOUS. With such simple ingredients, I can't help but question why the hell I can't make sandwiches like this at home. The first two times I went I didn't wait longer than 20 minutes, and the third time I waited for about an hour. It really depends on the time you go, so go at typical non-rush hours or just phone in.Overall: Try it. You won't regret doing so.
We went out of our way to stop here on a trip in San Francisco. It was a long line and the sandwich was good. I got the menage a trios, it was ok but not as good as we were expecting.
great sandwich, although I had to wait 45 mins in line for it.....next time I will pay someone to wait in line
so my review is actually for the original location on 16th st which i happened to make it to before they got evicted. as advertised the wait was hella long. We actually called in our order and they told us our sandwiches would be ready in "1 hour." but Ike's sandwiches are definitely worth the wait. next to Little Luccas in South City, along with Ike's these two spots make the 1-2 punch of the best sandwiches around The Bay.i got the Menage-a-Trois. I think it's hella funny how they label the wrappers on the sandwich. For my Menage-A-Trois it's 3 smile faces with the multiplication sign in between each as follows " :) x :) x :)" what i love about Ike's is that they use high quality local ingredients along with Ike's Dirty Sauce which they probably use crack to make cuz it's HELLA F'in GOOD!!! With your sandwich you also get a bag of Dirty Chips and a caramel apple pop. I would've liked to buy one of their t-shirts at the time to support their legal cause but the one i wanted at the time was sold out. it was a shame that they eventually were evicted but i'm glad Ike's lives on at LIME now. Gotta get my fix of Ikes!!
Doesn't get any better. Up in SF to look at schools with my daughter. DIdn't know about Ike's. A student at SFSU told us about it. We stopped by, OMG, the sandwhich was to die for. Ike has done a great job and youhave to eat there, the best sandwich I ever had. I didn't know a sandwhich could be so good!
Ike's is ok. I've been here a few times and never overly impressed. Its always crowded with people and takes awhile to get your sandwich from start to finish. This I wouldn't mind if the sandwiches were amazing but they aren't. They are good and worth a try but imo theres far better sandwich places around.
I went with a couple of co-workers a couple of months ago... nothing memorable as I thought it would be. I'd rather have a sandwich from Molinari...
This little sandwich shop has NOT:Much elbow room, tables, nor parking.However, all this doesn't really matter once you taste the food.They have meat, vegan, and gluten free options, so nobody's sad here, but we all ended up literally running away from here (more on that later).The tip jar said, "We work for tips and phone numbers." I'd give my phone number if it'd get me free sandwiches.And there was a shrine dedicated to Tim Lincecum on the wall to help him find his baseball mojo again, complete with a message box you can write stuff to him and drop it in.The sandwiches we had:1. Matt Cain (on Dutch Crunch)2. Vegan Meatless Mike (on Dutch Crunch)3. Sometimes I'm Vegan (on gluten-free bread)My brother loved his Matt Cain. I mean LOVED.He said it was the best sandwich he's ever had, especially with the Godfather Sauce.My sister loved her Vegan Meatless Mike, especially with the marinara.According to her, the Dutch Crunch bread is the best bread to order at Ike's.My Sometimes I'm Vegan was an, "Oh since we're here I'll get something" meal.The sandwich was pretty good and gluten-free bread was pretty good for gluten-free bread, which I tried for the sake of seeing what Ike's gluten-free bread tastes like. They use Daiya cheese, too, I think.So back to Tim Lincecum.I put my business card in the message box, which isn't that weird, right?But, I wrote, "I like you," on it. That's weird, at least according to my sister.As we were walking out of Ike's, I told her what I did. She gave me a *You crazy floozy!* look and ran away from me.This prompted my brother to also run away from me.So then, I also proceeded to run in order to catch them.That is the story of how we all ran away from Ike's.
Damn good sandwich. Even eating it hours later cold, it was delish.
I wasn't as impressed with the sandwiches as some others. They tend to be big, wet, gooey, gloppy messes which just probably isn't my taste. I also thought the sauces (I've had 3-4 different sandwiches with different toppings and sauces) were thick and heavy but not really all that flavorful.
This review was going to be 0 stars before I even left the place. Was looking to grab a sandwich quickly before leaving town and found this one on Yelp with good reviews. Ordered the sandwich and they said about 10m. Fifteen minutes later, I notice a couple people who were there before me were still there too. I bought a water and asked about my sandwich and the young girl just kinda said it takes about 10m and it should be soon. Grrrrr. Few minutes later the attentive guy that originally took my order with enthusiasm comes in, sees me and the other two people and immediately investigates, talked to us, apologizes, gets our sandwiches out to us and refunds our money. I should have gotten his name (bearded guy) but I assume he's the manager (or should be if he's not). If the other employees cared about the customers more than they did about chit-chatting I'd give them 4 stars. Sandwich was really good btw.
very yummy!!!
Mmm... this might have been the best sandwich I've ever had.Yesterday, a very kind gentleman offered to trek into the Castro (from the financial) to pick up sandwiches at ikes place. The rumor was ikes was closing down, so this was my last chance to check off box 100 on my 7x7 "100 things to eat before you die" list. I waited until 3pm for the sandwich all the while thinking, "this better be worth it". It was. I got the menage a trois and it was one of the best combination of flavors I've ever had in my mouth.It was only after that poor boy had taken the J all the way out to the Castro where it was announced that ikes found a loophole and could remain open, at least for the moment.Do yourself a favor, try out ikes place before they're threatened to leave again.
Got the Menage A Trois and it was delicious! We called in our sandwich 45 minutes before and walked in and didn't have to stand in the long line.
This place is a hassle, the neighbors suck and the sandwiches are so, so! Millers East Coast West kills it! Always a bunch of bullshit and a punk ass line to get what?! Some meat on some bread paaaaaalease!
Hands down the best sandwich of my life! I mean seriously it's perfection. Never seen a sandwich place with so many veggie options! I got the sometimes I'm a vegetarian. I would love to try them all! Not much more to say except I wish they would open up in SoCal!
My husband and I have been meaning to try this place out for a long time. I had the Lincecum on dutch crunch and it was SOOO good. I'm kind of a picky eater so I convinced my husband to let me get that sandwich while he picks a different one. He doesn't mind trying something outside the box. I actually feel bad now because this was the sandwich he was originally going to go with and it was just so much better than whatever he had. The bread was delicious on both sandwiches, but my husband and I ate half my sandwich on the way home because we just couldn't stop eating it. I am both happy and sad they are not closer to where we live since I would have to increase our eating out budget but I also wish I could visit more often. If you have been meaning to try Ike's go. Also, the sandwiches comes with a bag of chips, which is really cool. Yum Yum. Thanks!
NOM-ed the hell out of their meatless mike made with their famous dutch crunch bread.Good LORD, this place is amazing. It's generally crowded but it's definitely worth the wait.I recommend this HARD. Try it whenever you're around, you won't regret it!
I've always been the hugest fan of Roxie's but ever since the boyfriend has seen Ike's featured Kryptonite sandwich on man vs. food he couldn't stop ranting and raving about it. Upon one of his visits to the city, of course Ike's was on our list of destinations. The last time I came here i ordered the Nacho boy with pastrami instead of roast beef, mushrooms, avocado dirty sauce and added jalapeno poppers because I was feeling extra dirty. I think it was the poppers that did it but I wasn't fascinated by the sandwich. This time, I decided to order the spiffy tiffy and the bf of course ordered the kryptonite.Spiffy tiffy (halal chicken, mushrooms, avo, pepper jack, pesto and provolone) Kryptonite (Roast Beef, Corned Beef, Pastrami, Salami, Turkey, Bacon, Ham, Mozzarella Sticks, Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers, Beer Battered Onion Rings, Avocado, Pesto, EXTRA Pepper Jack) I def enjoyed my sandwich more the second time around without the jalapeno poppers. Too much in one sandwich takes away from the focus. The bf only finished half of his sandwich as he wanted to save/savor the rest for lunch the following day. He felt Ike's def lived up to the hype on tv and cant wait to go back again. I would say, consider ordering on the phone and coming to pick it up later... theres only 2 tables so you pln on eating elsewhere anyways.
Was in San Francisco over the weekend and before we got there my friend kept telling me about this sandwich place I HAD to try so she hyped it up a lot and let me just say that IT WAS EVERYTHING I EXPECTED AND MORE! I had the Spiffy Tiffy (MUST TRY) with onions and banana peppers on Dutch crunch (mmmm sooo good!) and my friend had the BLT. The next day we were feeling hungry and we decided to stop by Ike's again. This time I had a BLT and now I feel like every BLT I have won't be the same. Can't wait to get back to SF and have Ike's again! Definitely referring friends to stop here if they already haven't! Last but not least- customer service was real good and helpful! Thank you, Mr. Ike and all of your employees! Can't wait to try another sandwich!
Menage a Trois was amazing, lightly sweet BBQ pork and perfect balance of lettuce and tomatoes. Line was worth it and the prices are great!
I'm not much of a sandwich person and I avoid bread like the plague, but oh my goodness, this place was amazing. I just wish they had a place we could have eaten our sandwiches. The inside was too crowded, and it was super hot. And apparently you can't eat right out front. So my fiance and I wondered down the block and ate standing up under some shade. But, I would go back!
Definitely worth the wait!
Amazing sandwiches, what more needs to be said?
The sandwiches are amazing. Fabulous flavors, good size, lots of filling, etc. Don't come here if you expect to be neat. These sandwiches have so much sauce that it was dripping down my hands.. it was awesome. Every sandwich comes with a bag of chips and a lollipop :D Everything was awesome, but the reason why this place gets 4 stars is because the sandwich place isn't its own independent sandwich place. Its at a place called Lime which is also a restaurant (hence Ike's @ Lime... I get it now) so I was really confused. Seeing as how my boyfriend and I walked 2 miles to get there, we didn't want to just pick up our sandwiches and find a place where we could eat them. The music is loud and blaring and there are a ridiculous amount of drunk people. Thankfully one of the sandwich guys let us sit in the back of the restaurant so we were able to eat.
This place is too overrated, even more than before because it was on the 5:00 news a few days ago. A lot of people probably saw them featured and probably are making a mad dash to the place before it closes in a few weeks. I'm glad I had a chance to try it once, but I will never be back. I waited over an HOUR to even order my Tony Soprano on dutch crunch. I met Ike, adorable little guy who is very friendly and personable to the customers. The sandwich was good, but it honestly is not as "euphoric" or "orgasmic" as people in other reviews are saying. Seriously. A sandwich is just meat, cheese, veggies, etc stuffed between two pieces of bread. You can have the most secret, fat and calorie filled sauce in the world but a sandwich is just that: a sandwich. Nothing less, nothing more. And I've honestly had better sandwiches at Cafe de Melanio on Ocean street, which is a place where at least people have room to sit down and eat them. Plus they are made with love and not rushed like Ike's.I won't speak ad nauseum about Ike's legal issues, but if he'd only had the right permits, he wouldn't have gotten sued/evicted.  I wish Ike's a fond farewell, but I will not give them another hour of my time. My feet still hurt from the wait. If you MUST go, wear comfortable shoes, and take an ipod, a book, or someone you could chat with for hours with you.
Omg seriously the best sandwiches i have ever had! Hubby and i split the menage and name of girl you are dating and they were both soooooo good :). We also got the mama huda to go...and i am sure it will be just as good whenever we have room to eat it. Ike's is definitely on my to do list whenever i visit the bay area. Yummy!!!!!
If you can come here on a random weekday it will be worth your time!
I love Ikes! Best hot sandwiches and service in SF!
Amazing Sandwiches!! Thanks guys!
The story behind its conception and survival is super endearing! Generous and yummy sandwiches and a vegetarian-friendly menu, I'm ALWAYS excited to eat here!!I recommend ordering ahead, and even then there may be a wait (relatively shorter).
I can't even start with how good these sandwiches are. I have never had a bad one there yet. They are on the pricey side, so I don't go as often as I would like, but none worth checking out. Make sure you have plenty of napkins with you, because they are messy.
I've only been to their oakland location. The sandwhiches are good....they even have vegan gluten free options...altho you have to pick and choose toppings and kinda create your own. Just be careful when ordering gluten free...the first time I ordered they actually gave me a veggie sandwhich filled with fake chicken chunks (gardein brand) to which they told me were gluten free...but in REALITY, were actually PURE GLUTEN. They did apologize and gave me a couple freebies after that incident, but be warned, and careful, especially if you have celiac, or are gluten sensitive.
Featured on Man vs Food (but I didn't know that until I saw the picture on the wall), this place makes some delicious sandwiches. I had the "Nacho Boy" mainly for the avocado and it was pretty tasty. Not a lot of seating here and even fewer tables (zero tables, to be exact). Sandwiches are big, so you may want to consider sharing it with a friend. Check out their menu on their website and you can see that people consider nearly every sandwich as being 'Damn Tasty!' I don't know what else to say in this review. Try it!
The sandwiches are really tasty and there are tons of unique styles to choose from. The amount of people waiting in line in front of you isn't so great.
I feel like SF has way better food than LA! I wish we had an Ike's here in LA! I tried the Menage A Trois on dutch crunch and OMMMGGGG! sandwich heaven! I couldn't even say a word because it was so delicious! The place definitely needs more seating inside! We sat outside of the coffee shop next door and had to get a macchiato so we didn't feel bad for using their table! The voodoo chips are yummy as well! :D
The line is long, but worth it! You can pull up the entire menu online ... the board with randomly numbered sandwiches is just a sampler of the different offerings. Everyone has their opinion on which is the best sandwich, but you really can't go wrong i don't think ... just order any of them and go back and try them all one at a time. Not really sure what makes their sandwiches so delicious, maybe the bread, maybe the sauce ... definitely above the rest. Make sure you plan ahead and have a place in mind to eat your sandwich ... there's really no place to sit and eat. If you're really good, you can call in your order ahead of time.
On my most recent visit to SF, I made it a point to try this place after seeing how much Yelp love it was getting and because it was featured on Man vs Food. My friends and I came in on a rainy Friday night around 6pm straight from SFO and fortunately there was no line. It was actually kind of dead. I guess the rain scared everyone away because I was prepared to have to wait at least a half-hour for their famous Manage A Trois sandwich. Lucky us I guess.So the current location of Ike's is definitely odd being inside of the Lime lounge. I heard about the trouble Ike's had they had at their last location so I'm happy that they are at least able to stay in business until they find a more suitable location. But for now, the setup is very awkward. You place your order at the front cashier and they bring it to your table which is located in the very back of the lounge. The seating area just has a handful of tables so I imagine dining in can be frustrating on busier days. I also noticed that the tables were very dirty having not being wiped down, but whatever. I was just happy to have to not eat in the rain.Okay so before I get to the food, I must warn you that service stinks. Even though the place was dead, it still took over 15 minutes to get our food even though there was only three of us. We also asked one of the employees for water and he said he would bring it right away. It never came. They also put pickles in my friends sandwich even though he said no pickles. And I said earlier, the tables were dirty. Now that that's off my chest, let's talk sandwiches! I ordered the very hyped Manage A Trois sandwich on Dutch Crunch bread and it was really DELICIOUS! The combination of honey, honey mustard and bbq packs quite a punch. I loved the tender pieces of chicken, the combination of cheeses (pepper jack, swiss, gouda) and how the bread was crunchy on the outside but soft in the middle. It really was excellent. I'm not sure about $12 excellent, but I can definitely see myself ordering it again.Be warned though, the Manage A Trois is very sweet so it may ruin your taste buds if you are drinking soda or want to try multiple sandwiches. I had a bite of my friend's Eli Manning and it tasted super bland in comparison. However, he said it was really good (despite the pickles he didn't want). My other friend got the We're Just Friends and she really liked it.In sum, the sandwiches are delicious and I would most certainly come back despite the crappy service and inflated prices.
Ike's Place serves the BEST sandwiches. Sandwiches are probably my favorite category of food and this place is unbeatable. There is a reason why people wait hours in line for a sandwich. The store is pretty much a hole in the wall with a ridiculous line going around the block. Be prepared to wait in line for the sandwiches which are unbelievably delicious. They put a garlic bread spread on both sides of the bread before piling on generous amounts of toppings and then toasting everything together. What comes out is pure deliciousness. The seating is outside and there are about 10 seats available so I suggest getting it to go as you will never get a seat if the line goes around the block. You pretty take about 3 steps into the store, order, pay, then wait outside for Ike to bring you your sandwich. When I traveled to San Fran, Ike's Place was a must after seeing it on Man v. Food. I was not disappointed. They have too many sandwiches to choose from so if you are new to this place, go online and pick your sandwich before you go. I got the Superman which was packed with meat and absolutely delicious. The next time I am in town, I will try the Doomsday and the Menage a Trois which Ike told someone who had ordered it that it is his favorite sandwich.Ike is usually at the store helping prepare your food, take your orders and give you your sandwich when it is ready. He is really friendly to the customers. If you are a Dodgers fan and the Dodgers are in town, do not go wearing a Dodgers uniform because if there is a line, he will not serve you. Ike actually told someone in line that when the Dodgers came into town, half of the line was wearing Dodgers gear and he told them to go away. If this is true or not, I don't know but I heard him say that.
I like Ike's. I go there every 6 months or so. I just don't find it to be GREAT like so many people do. Don't get me wrong... go there, check it out and you will enjoy it. It's just not my favorite place like so many people. Good, clean, healthy food.
I've heard & read numerous positive reviews for Ikes & they definitely live up to their expectations! The menagetois & paul reubens sandwiches are to-die-for!! Their dutch crunch bread is perfect. At other places, it's usually super hard & cuts the roof of your mouth, but this one is nice & soft - super fresh. I can't wait to go back to try more!Tip: If you go at 10am right when they open on Saturday, there is no line! (I've tried during prime time & the wait was 2 1/2 hours).
hands down best hot sandwich out there!!! infinite creations - never would of thought of even a quarter of them!!! I always order the Pizzle! Chicken BAcon Ranch Cheddar Cheese on Dutch Crunch! Served with a Caramel Apple Pop!! Always!
Came here for the first time today (lord knows how long I've been living here) and gave Ike's a shot. It was about 2:30ish and there was hardly a line to wait in...I received my order with a quickness! Niccccce...I got the Going Home for Thanksgiving which had cranberry sauce, havarti, sriracha, turkey, lettuce, and tomato. Ay mami, it was sooo good!! A hint of spicy and sweet, how could you go wrong? Another awesome thing I have to mention is that a bag of chips and soda come free with your order when Matt Cain pitches, who knew? This place is grubbin :)
When you eat four sandwich in one day, it deserve 5 stars. This is the place if you want to eat a damn good sandwich...love the names they have for their sandwiches. I had the Matt Cain Champion edition. 2 Doomsday and Kryptonite. Man love their dirty sauce.Friendly ass staff...you know food is good when you open up the sandwich and just laugh cause the amount of meat on their sammie is very nice and when you bite into it and then under your breath you say ummm with your eyes close just to savor the taste...equals amazing...will return again when i can afford the damn caories in these things...still working off the four sammie calories.
So I was driving on 16th Street one random Sunday afternoon and noticed a huge line of people lining the sidewalk. I rolled my eyes thinking it was just another one of those pot pie places that the hipsters flock to; not my thing. But then I got home and looked up Ike's on Yelp and after reading the reviews decided to give it a try. I've been back three times since.Ambiance: Hipster.Service: Very knowledgeable and accommodating for food allergies.Food (gluten-free dairy-free perspective): They offer gluten free bread! Its been over six years since I last ate real bread, but if my memory serves me correctly, their gluten free bread almost tastes like the real thing! During my first visit I ordered the [Name of Girl I'm Dating] sandwich without pepperjack cheese. The worker taking my order was very observant and subsequently informed me that their honey mustard contains dairy. If mustard isn't an option, BBQ sauce is my second go-to sandwich condiment so I opted for the Sanchez College Prep sandwich instead (minus cheddar, plus avocado). Each sandwich also comes with a bag of chips (my favorite is the salt and pepper) and a requisite hipster sucker. Their sandwiches tend to get a bit soggy if you don't eat them immediately...but that's okay because they're just so damn delicious!
HypeHypeHypeHypeHypeHypeHypeHypeHypeHypeHypeI've always come during the weekdays during off hours so i never had to wait. I've tried the Menage a Trois, Roast beef, Matt Cain, and the one with the Jalapeo peppers in it. Let me tell you this place is ALL HYPE. Their sandwiches are just mediocre! However, their famous "dirty sauce" is pretty good.IF you must try this place, I recommend the MATT CAIN! It's the best sandwich they have. If you want a really bomb ass sandwich hit up Little Luccas!
BEST SANDWICH I'VE EVER HAD! Delicious and packed with flavor. I ordered the Bella and added pickles to give it some crunch. It was so yummy and I had heard this place was the place to be to get a sandwich in SF so I was pleasantly surprised when my sandwich was pure perfection! I would definitely go back when ever I am in SF. Only bummer is that there are no tables to sit at Ikes so you have to wait until you get home to eat your yummy sandwich.
My 400th Review...I saved it for Ike's.I'm not even a "sandwich-person" but Ike's are amazingly delicious. I can't even begin to describe how good they were. I tried: (Name of the Girl I'm Dating) - Halal chicken, honey mustard, avocado, Pepperjack. Forty!?? - chicken fried steak, choice of sauce, cheddarGot both on Dutch Crunch bread with Dirty Sauce. That bread really makes the sandwiches even better. Everything was just so good, flavorful, and the textures of everything just work. I"m really in love with these sandwiches. Both were about $10 each. We got really lucky and there was barely a line. It took about 15 minutes to get our orders. I don't know if Ike is always there but he even gave us our order. The menu was a little bit overwhelming because there's so much to offer. They have Vegetarian options and Gluten Free options too. This place definitely deserves the Top spot for Yelp 2010.
This is an Original, AMAZING, DELICIOUS place to eat a sandwich. I usually get thier " name of the girl I'm dating" and I share it with my sister or brother because they are so big.
With over 3000 reviews there isn't much left to say.Tons of different sandwich choices including a lot of vegetarian and even vegan offerings. There is definitely a sandwich for everyone's tastebuds.I've had a few sandwiches now and all have been tasty, with the exception of some slightly dry chicken one time. There is a long wait, but that can be avoided by calling in your order. You can skip the line and go straight to the cashier. The only other downfall is that I think they are slightly overpriced.
This place is AWESOME !!! Saw this on the travel channel and knew I had to try it out. I tried the Lincecum on dutch crunch, amazing..all the flavors were great. My nephew had the Hot Momma Huda, tastes exactly like a a buffalo wing (my fav). The lemonade was great and the chips were perty awesome too, especially the bar b que. The service was okay, maybe it was a busy day but one of the cashiers seemed to be a little irritated with the amount of orders coming in at once. Only downside is that there is no seating, we ended up walking to Dolores Park a couple blocks away to enjoy our sandwiches.
A San Francisco and now Bay Area wide landmark. Easily a can't miss for the first timer or the seasoned veteran. It will make a regular out of you. You will crave it and it will haunt your dreams Sorry Earl and other sandwich joints, this is one of the best in my opinion. The owner Ike is super friendly and you can tell he is passionate about his business, and grateful for his customers. He is always giving free skip the line passes and sandwich deals (follow them on Facebook & Twitter for latest contests). The menu can be extensive so looking at the website ahead of time will safe you time and help you decide what to get ahead of time. I think it is great that he continues to expand throughout the Bay Area, to spread the happiness in sandwich form. I personally have been to the Stanford campus location ( located in the Engineering building), and Ike's Lair location located in Redwood City ( different ownership) in downtown, and the Ike's on Twin Dolphin Drive, Redwood city. That one is take-out only. The sandwiches are in halves and cold. Other locations: SFSU (lucky), Santa Rosa, Oakland, etcTip: Not all locations have the exact same menus. Not all sandwiches are available at each locations. Also sometimes you can order off the menu items. On the unlikely chance that you cant' find something you want on the menu, you have the option to make your own creation.Vegetarians and Vegans can rejoice because pretty much any sandwich can be made vegetarian or vegan. They give you tons of choices. They also offer dirty brand chips (go with the jalapeno). Several vintage style sodas, and give you free caramel-apple pops with your order. Recommend:1) The Change- ribeye steak, bbq sauce, onion rings, bacon (add) ,extra dirty sauce (Ike's famous always get EXTRA), on dutch crunch bread* Depending on the location this may or may not be on the menu.2) Matt Cain3) Leninade- funny name, but really good soda not offered elsewhere
Sandwiches as big as your head!!!!!!!!!Seriously, the sandwiches here are huge. But at $10+ per sandwich, I guess they better have some substance/weight in them!We ordered the Eli Manning on dutch crunch and the Mills Vikings on French roll. The Eli Manning was delicious! Love that dutch crunch! I am not a fan of pepperjack so I wasnt digging on the Mills Vikings sandwich. But each sandwich definitely had a lot of flavor!The place loses a star because there is no where to sit to eat your sandwich. We had to take our sandwiches to the car to enjoy them there. Some patrons have to sit on the sidewalk to eat their sandwiches. Unfortunately, this has caused problems for the shop because the neighbors are trying to shut the place down due to all the noisy patrons and loiters. Despite the lack of seating, I hope this place stays open! Sign the petition to keep the shop open if you get a chance!
Awesome, check it out. Got the menage a trois
Love, love, love. We used to go to Ike when he first opened his teeny place & only a few people went, then publicity, now super popular with lines. STILL worth the wait, the sandwiches are like nothing else i've ever tried. We love them!
Some pretty darn good sandwiches here, not too shabby. On the menu, I love the Jim Rome Sandwich. But off the menu, I got for Dutch Crunch, pesto, butter, garlic, cheddar, roasted turkey breast, hmm that's good. Might just be the best sandwich in the city.
Ive heard great things about this place. The first sandwich I had fantastic. A solid 4 1/2 star rating. I was sooooo eager to try every sandwich in the menu. A new life goal! But then I had my second, third, and fourth sandwich and just like that with each sandwich I grew a bit more disappointed. Basically all the sandwiches started to taste the same to me even though I ordered different ones each time. Not sure if it was the bread or the sauces they use but suddenly they all tasted like a generic Ike Place sandwich. Not to say that the sandwich was bad. It just wasn't as great as the first one. I would still have these sandwiches and be content with them but I am not as excited. I just wish that each sandwich tasted distinctly different. I know its a challenge to do that with the amount/variety they have, but maybe less variety would make better individually tasting sandwiches. Either way, I am jealous of those having their first Ike's Place sandwich... such fleeting joy.
great place - they have every sandwich imaginable and the team is ready to work.
I am often made fun of for my superlatives. But in this case, I really do mean it when I say that Ike's makes one of the best sandwiches I have ever had.I went by yesterday and was pleased to see that there wasn't a line. We were in and out in under 15 minutes. I had the Matt Cain, and my fianc had the Spiffy Tiffy. I much preferred mine. The sauce was fantastic, and the combination of meats was perfect. I love the Dutch crunch bread. It reminded me of dinner rolls I used to get in old school restaurants. While we passed on drinks, it wasn't for a lack of options. They had Saranac Shirley Temple and Cheerwine. Awesome. I definitely think the hype is appropriate. I will be thinking about that sandwich for a long time.
Ike's is great! The sandwiches are very very good. The only tricky thing is there are sooo many options!
Dutch crunch bread was delish. i got the "Nacho Boy". roast beef, avocado, lettuce, mushrooms. it was yummy. took a while to get my sandwhich but didnt mind. overall, yummy.
Freakin love this place. Hate the the wait. Even calling ahead doesn't work cuz they can't answer the phone fast enough. Awesome sammy's though!
These are hands down the best sandwiches ever made. The service is quick and the quality is amazing. I dare all carnivore to try the Captain Kirk and tell me the Vegan breaded chicken isn't better than the real thing.
So the first time I tried Ike's, a friend asked me how did I like it, and I muttered the word "ma-gical." I have never tasted anything like it. I ordered the menage a trois on dutch with jalapeno poppers in there. I was sitting at my desk at work, about to only take a bite or two since lunch was about to be over (it was sort of a journey to get down to Ike's and back during lunch time), and I SWEAR, when I took the first bite, time slowed down. That seven minutes until lunch was over lasted a little while. My taste buds were definately feeling it...it was mind blowing! It felt like waking up to warm sunlight, or a first kiss, hitting a home run...I dunno....it was just all GOOD! This is hands down my favorite sandwich spot. So damn tasty, scrumptious, awesome, magical, mind blowing, it's gold...all that good stuff. The menu is so creative. Every time I've gone, I've always ordered the same thing. I'll try to order something else the next time I go, or maybe a couple of something elses...but that will be on top of my usual order. Paolo says: Do yourself a favor. Go to Ike's, order the menage a trois on dutch, add jalapeno poppers. 'Nuff said. (Also, call ahead people...that's what I do. You'll do you and your appetite a big favor.)A++ =)
I waited a LONG time to some to this place (since I first saw it on Man v. Food a few years ago), so I knew my first visit to San Francisco had to include a trip to Ikes. I was ok with the wait, but I was not ok with the additional 20 minute walk to find a place to eat the dang thing! We took our sandwiches to Dolores Park, but by the time we unwrapped them, the sandwiches were no longer hot and kinda soggy, disappointing but Dutch Crunch bread is definitely what dreams are made of. Tasty, but worth the 1hr (total time) wait? Not sure
I had heard that lines for this place could get crazy, so I had planned on phoning in my order right at 10 a.m. However, I discovered they have an app and you can place an order even before 10! Sweet! You choose what sandwiches you want, type of bread, sauce, etc. and then choose a time available. I ended up picking up my sandwiches a half hour late but there were very few people there (a weekday). So I had asked for the banana peppers on the side, which I did not get. But the rest of the order was correct. I ordered the Manage a Trois and Hella Fat Bastard. Maybe bc the sandwiches were cold by the time we ate them, but they weren't anything spectacular. The sandwiches were fully loaded and while I'd consider them good sandwiches, they weren't great. I liked the Manage a Trois better than the Hella Fat Bastard, which tasted really dry. I had to look up what Ike's Dirty Sauce was later on, and it's basically a garlic aioli sauce. I could barely taste it, or maybe I just didn't care for it. The Manage a Trois had a really good BBQ sauce that really added to it. Also, I didn't like the Mozarella Sticks in the Hella Fat Bastard as much as I thought, but my friend thought it was a great idea. The bread, Dutch Crunch, was good. $25+ for two sandwiches was a bit much, even if they did come with a bag of chips!
No matter which location I go to or what sandwich I order IKE's is ALWAYS the best sandwich. No sandwich has never been disappointing. The only complaint that can be made is that it is SO POPULAR that the wait is always kind of a burden. However, it is a very small price to pay for the quality and tastiness that comes with each and every sandwich they provide. One of my favorites is the Manage a trois that I have ordered many times. The owner is always extremely friendly and heavily involved in the communities that each of his sandwich shops reside in. Hands down one of the best all-around sandwich shops in the area. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK IKE's!!!!
Good Sandwiches. Just eat them right away after you get them, they are not good if they sit for a little while.
People are always saying that you need to try the Menage-a-Trois here (and I agree to a point). It is an awesome sandwich and I do feel it is a must-try. But whenever a friend asks me what to get here if they've never been here before, I only have one recommendation for them, and that's the Kryptonite. Granted, most people will not be able to finish this in one sitting since it's their largest sandwich on the menu (and most expensive). But despite having just about every possible ingredient known to man in this, it is ridiculously good. Every item in this sandwich complements the other and before you know it, you'll find yourself sitting there thinking "OMG OMG OMG....THIS IS SOOOOO GOOD!"Just as an fyi, my top 3 sandwiches here so far are the King Koopa, the Menage-a-Trois, and the Kryptonite. But now that I've found out that they're re-opened @ Lime, I'm gonna have to go there again and try out the Lex Luthor, the 2nd of the monster sandwiches. Mmmmmm....death by yumminess overload. I can live (or technically die) with that. :)
Like most people I love Ike's sandwiches. There is a huge variety and they can easily cater to the vegetarian/vegan crowd. My favorite is the #118 Matt Cain. Turkey, Roast Beef and Salami with a creamy dijon. SO GOOD. What makes Ike's really stand out is that they buy all of their bread half baked. They then spread some of their secret dirty sauce on and bake it in! It is like starting a sandwich with a yummy garlic bread. Then all the other goodies go on after. I know Ike's has lines, just call ahead or get in line....well worth it.
So delicious! Totally lived up to the hype :)
I've had Ike's a couple of times and I appreciate the diverse sandwich choices. However, after every meal, I've felt extremely full!!! I'd rather get a Roxie's sandwich in SF with less fuss (i.e. parking, waiting in line, no where to sit).
I loooooooooove this place. Its just around the corner from my house now and I eat there way more than I should! The best sandwiches!
Got the Spiffy Tiffy. Loved the avocado, mushrooms, halal chicken, and the dutch crunch. Wasn't feeling the pesto too much but it was overall a really good sandwich!!-1 for being the fattiest sandwich of my life though. The dirty sauce (made of oil, butter, and mayo) wasn't as amazing as I thought it'd be :(
On my first visit here, my orders were a bit more saucy than usual. On my second visit, I was 100 percent satisfied. My brother was telling me about how he has been wanting to try Ike's especially after seeing it premiered on the food network. We went on a Tuesday afternoon, so the wait was not bad at all. On my recent visit, they expanded some of their chip selections. I ordered the Spiffy Tiffy as I am a fan of avocado and pesto on my sandwich on their dutch crunch. My brother ordered the Menage a Trois which is a junk load assortment of meat on dutch crunch bread. One of my favorite perks to coming to Ikes is their unique glass bottled soda collection ranging from several selections of root beers to cherry soda. I usually choose a root beer. This time, I chose the caramel flavored root beer. It was a bit too sweet for my taste. It seems like their workers are generally very down to earth type of people offering fantastic service. While we waited for our sandwiches, they made a mistake on someones order and had an extra sandwich on hand. We were offered that mistake sandwich of Jaymee Sirewich which consist of fried chicken with yellow bbq for free. Win!!!  My brother ended up eating both the Jaymee Sirewich and the Menage a Trois. He says he prefers the Jaymee Sirewich. The Spiffy Tiffy was not heavy. It has the robust taste of the pesto and the avocado which I love.  Another perks to Ikes is that when you finish your sandwiches, you take a peep into your brown bag and there is a nice green apple caramel candy pop waiting for you.
Love.love.love!It's not often that I visit a restaurant that I automatically can't wait to review and add my five stars!My gals and I were in SF on Mon. (5/7) and the lovely Kat decided that we should all try Ike's which she's heard/read amazing reviews on. It's kind of what I would call a "hole in the wall" and when we first entered the line I was hesitant because there are so many sandwich choices, coupled with my own pickiness... but upon reaching the counter, the very nice hipster looking young lady that took my order could not be MORE helpful! She explained the vegan options, broke down each item in detail, told me about free add-ons, or veggie-meat substitutes.... even reading all of it back to make sure my sammie would be a delight! Of course my girl pals responded as I finally reached them, "Wow, Julie's order only took an hour! giggles" okay, so maybe 10 minutes solid....but I know what I like...If you love sandwiches half as much as I do, you will take your happy feet/bicycle/vehicle/or skateboard.... find some darn parking (this is for you JB! ;)and try a sub! SOOO freakin' good. my mouth is watering thinking of my sammie and I want more.... Also, chips & a complimentary lollipop come included with every order. Score!This is a MUST TRY!
The Paul Reubens is a delicious sandwich. I really want to try different ones when I come here, but I always come back to the Paul Reubens. It's one of the best sandwiches ever made.Call in your order ahead of time since there is always a long line. People are pretty friendly, so the line never seems to take a long time. The place is pretty damn clean.Update: I finally tried another sandwich (Mnage a trois), but was disappointed. I think people order it just to say mnage a trois. Paul Reubens, I will never doubt you again!
This is NOT some skimpy little sandwich place. If you are one hungry hippo and want to get your "grub on", this is the place to go. They seriously load *correction* .... "dump truck" a ton of yummy goodness in between two slices of bread. Between my friend, lil sis, and I, we ordered: a Kryptonite, Menage a trois, Tony Soprano, Lex Luthor, and a Paul Reuben. We're small built people so of course we couldn't finish it all. We had to take a few breathers and then go at it again several times to consume all 5 sandwiches. But hey... There are so many funky things on their menu that you just have to try out. Literally! The two $20 sandwiches (kryptonite and lex luthor) were well worth it. I can't wait to come back again and try out the others. I'd say this is one of my favorite sandwich places to hit up in SF.
OMG.............SO GOOD. I was visiting my brother in SF and we grabbed Ike's before roaming the city. I was blown away by the deliciousness of my sandwich. Definitely a must visit spot. Yum!
I got a Big Bird on wheat. To this day, I still credit Ikes with making we want to put cream cheese on my sandwiches. And I want to drink the dirty sauce. Most do. But here's the secret. I know they're so caloric, that I've only had one. ONE. I know. I KNOW. It's like an event. That sandwich takes dedication to get and eat. I am waiting for the lighting bolt to hit me and say "Get thee to the Ike-ary" before I go again. But it's coming. I believe. My stomach got a taste of the goods, and it never forgets.
They have a lot of creative subs, and great options for vegetarians; as a bonus they are really large enough to share which makes up for them being on the pricy side. You can tell it's popular from the long line always wrapping to the outside, but you can call ahead and order in advance.
It's very much overrated methinks. After finding out that their $10 sandwiches are not organic or nitrate-free, I decided to get the "Sometimes I'm a vegetarian" sandwich on a dutch crunch, and, sadly, it was just too heavy and drenched in grease and mayo. The menu says it's supposed to feature some grilled portabello mushroom (self imagined a huge portabello cap, cooked to perfection with some grill marks), but most of the time I could even find or taste them. Sad day. I had the chance to taste the sandwiches my friends ordered, and they were also greasy, too heavy on the mayo, and a little on the bland side.
big portions yummmmmmmmm'i know its a long line but, worth the wait
Good sandwiches! woohoo :)
I saw this place on Man Vs. Food and made it top priority when I visited San Fran for the Outsidelands Festival in 2011. I was NOT disappointed! It's by far the wackiest, most unique sandwich shop in the country. All of the subs sounded insane! I wish I would have been there for longer so I could try them all. The lines are crazy long but once you take your first bite you realize why. They even throw in a lollipop. Best sub I've ever had. Can't wait to get back to San Francisco!
My new favorite sandwich shop in the world. I had the Nacho Boy and Lincecum, but I don't think it matters what you choose - the sandwiches here are incredible. Will happily be returning to try all the other sandwiches.
I have no idea what people see in this place. I've tried it and it's pure schlock. Not to mention, you can get wildly better food for much less.
Really loved the sandwiches at Ike's Place. Staff is very friendly and helpful when it comes to helping you out with ordering. Also have to love all the options you have with what you can put in your sandwich (mozzarella sticks).
Went here yester love this place had the hot mama the sandwich was great the chips were also good. They always include the lollipop as usual. The only negative about Ikes is they dont have anywhere to sit
Truly fantastic sandwiches - both meat, vegetarian, and vegan. Friendly staff. The line looks long but doesn't feel that way. The chips included with the sandwich are always fun to look through. The only down side is there's few spots to sit inside the place.
Ordered the Matt Cain - roast beef, turkey, salami, Godfather sauce, provolone on Dutch Crunch
Can you spare some Change? I never knew about dutch crunch! and oh my does that sandwich taste so good! Love the atmosphere although there still isn't any eating tables around, still. But trust me! It's worth the walk to the park to take in a wonderful San Francisco day! Make sure to check their website! They have an immense list of sandwiches that arn't even on their walls!
Is it the BEST sandwich place in SF? I'm not sure. I won't lie.....it is pretty amazing, and the combinations you can get are phenomenal! I love Ikes's for sure. The people that work there rotate in and out pretty quick so there isn't really ever a recognizable person there, but they are always friendly. Worth the money. I go gluten-free mostly because the sandwich doesn't end up being 8 meals worth. I love the turkey-cranberry.
So good! You can't go wrong here!

This is just pure comfort food in sandwich form.Yes, some sandwiches are vegan. No, they are not 'healthy.' But just order one.I like the Kirk.
Really Tasty Sandwiches - Fun enviroment alot of energy
I put Ike's sandwich in my mouth and JIZZED IN MY PANTS. Sandwiches conquered:Fat BastardName of the Girl Im DatingBackstabber Al Bundy Jeries Big Meat Sandwich Eli Manning Lex Luthor Kryptonite Sanchez 12 organisms later... 2 of them mine, i still give every sandwich a 10 out of 10!This place does not disappoint, every time i go, old Ike's or new, there is a line curling around the block. I dont care for the wait because it is well worth it! One sandwich usually fills me up but i tend to get two every time, because it is just that good. Like an organism, Ike's should be experienced once by everyone before they die, with an Ike's sandwich, you can kill two birds with one stone!Peace, Love and Sadface
I never knew sandwiches could be this good and take up to a damn hour for it!
Been here several times, but went with a date and waited 45 minutes in line to get two sandwiches..after we ordered she noticed the sandwiches cost $10 each and was doubtful that the wait and cost of a Sandwich was worth it...but one bite and she was sold.....Confirmation of my previous 5 star rating of Ike's...can't go wrong with anything here!
Ike's is still good if you like wet messy sandwiches. So pretty much my previous review still holds.This time I got the "Menage-a-trois" on dutch crunch with everything and the "...just a stupid eggplant sandwich" on french bread with onions only.I liked both but i didn't get the hype over the Menage-a-trois.The reason it only gets 3 stars now is just that the popularity has translated into a terrible wait time. Not only is there a line, but the food is super slow too. Expect a 20 minute wait for food - after you get to the front of the line and order. There's only 1 cashier so it takes a long time just to order as the cashier also handles pick up orders at the same time. And they aren't too concerned about being quick either. Ike's need some better customer service reps. Much better when it was just Ike and his mom.I don't feel the need to return after trying the famed "Menage".
I'll make this one short and sweet:The Pros:-great sammitch, great sauce, great bread, great ingredients-chips are included!-cool people. And I'm not being ironic. The Cons:-looooong wait, out in the sun (1+ hours)-nowhere to "eat in."-unfriendly neighbors (but I wouldn't want people eating sammitches in front of my house, either)I saw Ike's on Man v. Food and HAD to visit when we got to San Fran. My wife went shopping while I made the trip to the Castro district. Good thing, since the wait was way long, and she's not a sandwich person. Coming all the way from the east coast, my mouth was watering for the Hella Fat Bastard, and it did not disappoint. Easily one of the top 2 sandwiches I've ever eaten. So don't let the line outside scare you away. It's only because there's no dining room there. It's good eatin'.
I called to get a service call for my projector tv that I purchased there about 17 years ago. I told the guy I spoke to that the screen comes down then goes right back up. He said you need a new one. I said that may be but I think it's in the screen and I would like a service person to come check he said it will cost $400 for someone to come for a service call. I clarified what he said then told him if I had of needed a new one I would have bought if from him but I woulld NOT pay $400 for a service call. He blew it. I called. Texas Electronics they came out for a $45 service call.
[Featured: Man vs. Food (Travel Channel) at youtube.com/watch?v=Y1cGAll these years, I've wondered what made San Francisco's Castro District famous. Now I know: Ike's Place, yep, that must be it. ;)Ike has maintained close to a five star rating through over 2,000 reviews. The rating distribution speaks volumes of their popularity, along with the long but fast moving line out the door. I came here thinking they had no place to go but down and, for sure, my expectations will be way too high. I've heard about this place long before my days with yelp and they were also featured in the travel channel, Man vs. Food. Ugh, everything was set up for a big let down.No, Ike's Place is not overrated, not overhyped, and not exaggerated.  I had the Matt Cain on dutch crunch, extra jalapenos, with diet soda and a bag of dirty salt and vinegar chips...Wow! It was like an angel threw up in my mouth....wait, I mean that as a good thing. I took two heaping bites of my wife's SF-BLT without asking (quite a boring choice if you ask me, considering their massive selection). That one was also amazing. It's hard to really tell what makes these sandwiches special. The meat was juicy, soft, and tender. The bread was fantastic. They also use some kind of special sauce, they call it the "dirty sauce," I don't know, maybe it has crack in it. Every bite was just orgasmic. To top it all off, the staff handled the crowd flawlessly. They stayed efficient and smiling at every chance they get. They were very friendly and appreciative of everyone there. The crowd was mostly hip and very chill...I think I know how to explain that. In an effort to be fair, let me find things to criticize. First, I don't think they have diet coke...only diet pepsi...eeeewww... Second, they don't deliver directly to my work and my home at my beckon calling. While I'm tempted to dock them a star or two from these obvious shortcomings, I'll cut them some slack.   ;)
I'm not a sandwich snob by any means, but I wasn't extremely impressed by Ike's. I will definitely try it again though since I ordered it to go, and my sandwich was very soggy. The flavor of the menage-a-trois was really good, but I couldn't get over the texture of soggy, wet bread. I will definitely have it made to order and eat it nearby next time. Sadly I didn't have the coupon on my birthday to get a free sandwich...
1) Call your order in ahead of time. You have to get on Muni to get there anyhow.2) Branch out. Everyone has their long term favorites, but that menu is huge. Try something new, you probably will like it. The other day I went for the Meatless Mike and holy cow! It was the best meatball sub I've ever had, (probably the addition of jalapenos, which really took it over the top) and only at the END did I find out it was vegetarian. Crazy. 3) That said, #1 on the menu is the Elvis Keith, and it deserves to hold that slot. A finer sandwich does not exist in these fabled states. The owner once confessed to me (while I waited in line) that he had eaten the Elvis Keith every day for a month straight. I'm not sure what else in life can deliver like that. Every day, day in, day out, for a month straight, and still satisfies on day 30.4) Oh yeah, at the Castro location, you might run into Ike himself. (He might even give you a hug.)
Hmmm... was it worth the wait? Let's see... we called in our order promptly at 11AM and were told the soonest we could come by to pick them up would be in three and a half hours! So much for eating right away but we knew that when we decided to have Ike's for lunch (or a mid afternoon snack in this case.) So, back to the original question, was it worth the wait?Without a doubt, yes! Having grown up in a deli culture, I fancy myself as knowing a great sandwich from an ok one. With that said, my time in SF has been a let down in this category save from Freddy's Ocean Beach and now Ike's Place. I had the #91 aka the Paul Reubens - Sliced Corned Beef, Homemade Poppy Seed Coleslaw, French Dressing with Swiss and of course the whole thing was cover in dirty sauce. A $10 meal that will keep you full for the rest of the day. Beautifully stacked corned beef that was super fresh with bright purple cabbage and all the fixins on a sweet as all get out Dutch Crunch bread. Damn, it was GOOD and now I'm thinking I must start to try to eat one of everything on this menu to find out which ones the best. Enjoy!
I always bring tourists to Ike's Place to grab a scrumptious sandwich before heading out around town. My particular favorite place to enjoy an Ike's sandwich: grab one, and race on up to Twin Peaks to enjoy it while admiring the amazing view of San Francisco (when the weather permits, obviously). Personal favorites: Lincecum, (Name of Girl I'm Dating), Menage A Trois
Awesome sandwiches. Although the wait can be long (thus loses one star)...it is best to order online...then the wait is relatively minimal.
Like the thousands of reviews before me I too agree with the consensus that Ike's Place is a bomb diggity sandwich place. With a variety of sandwich options and toppings to choose from, Ike's does not leave your taste buds hangin'. My generous portion of Hollywood SF Cheesesteak sandwich came with chips and a caramel apple lollipop. A cherry on top.
Hands down best to-go sandwiches in the city ! Ate them at Dolores Mission Park. One sandwich will carry over into another meal
This place probably doesn't need another glowing review, but what the heck. This place is just the tops. I am beyond grateful for the insane veggie options here and love coming over when I find the time/space in my belly. The wait is a million times better in the new location and the food just as tasty. It's a must see when I have guests visiting.
So good! They've got a ton of different choices...almost too many if thats possible. But they get slammed at the lunch hour...call ahead for best experience and less lines. There's a separate line to pay for phone orders and they will give you a time to come pick up.
I love Ike's, especially since they opened this location. Matt Cain and Hella Fat Bastard are my two favorites. I'm not normally a mayo person, but even I can't say no to the dirty sauce. As everyone else tells you, the sandwiches are huge, fully stuffed with veggies, and a great value for the money.You can get a good turkey or ham or BBQ sandwich anywhere, so go for something that's unique to Ike's. Anything with Halal Chicken is good, Nacho Boy is delicious (roast beef, mushroom, avocado, swiss), and of my course my two favorites mentioned above.
It's just a sandwich place. That being said, it is 24 hours later and I'm still thinking about how good my Menage was. Definitely top 3 sandwiches I've ever eaten. The bonus is they stock dirty chips, Sioux City soda and provide a lollipop for dessert. I can't always get to the city, but I intend to haunt their Stanford location.
Yeah, it's tasty. Don't eat here everyday, though. You shall increase in size if you do. I go about once a month. They apply sauce via garden hose, apparently.
The wait was 45 mins and that was just to order! The sandwiches weren't bad, but I expected a lot more from everything I've been reading. They definitely overdo the mustard. If I go back, I will have to remember to tell them to go easy on that.
we were still talking about their sandwiches for hours.
Seriously great sandwiches.
OK, so I was very excited to try the place due to the great Yelp reviews. I went on Saturday and the wait wasn't too bad, maybe around 15 minutes. I got the CBLT and the Pride of Castro for my bf, both with everything. At first, I was expecting some sort of delicious explosion in my mouth; well, that didn't happen. After the initial disappointment, it dawned on me that beyond the lofty expectations that it obviously didn't live up to, it wasn't even a decent sandwich. I simply didn't like it all that much. The bread was a bit hard, the meat nondescript and the dirty sauce, forgettable. Maybe I went on a bad day, but not sure if there was any glimpse of promise in the sandwich to make me go back and give it another shot.
Yummy scrumptious sandwiches. Small place with no tables just a few chairs. Takes a while to get your food, especially when it's incredibly busy. Be prepared to spend at least $10 on a sandwich (drink is not included). I personally feel that Ike's is overrated. I mean their sandwiches are good but I wouldn't necessarily got out of my way just to get one.The cashier was really nice though!
I love this place! The best sandwich shop in the city...I had a joes big meat sandwich. It had roast beef, turkey, salami, pastrami, corned beef I don't know seems like it had every animal in my sandwich! Then I added mushrooms, onion rings, mozzarella sticks and provolone cheese with extra dirty sauce! Dirty sauce, garlic aioli mayo baked in to the bread! Heavenly! The sandwich is huge and worth every penny!
Yum! The wait wasn't too bad considering it was a holiday, and we received our order within 30 minutes or so. I've heard that lines are sometimes an hour long, so I probably would never wait that long for just a sandwich. Call in your order or have it delivered if you live nearby! I wasn't that hungry yet, so I split the menage a trios sandwich with a friend and it was the right amount for a small lunch. Their dutch crunch roll is the best one I've had so far with just a hint of sweetness, and the chicken covered in dirty sauce and honey mustard with the trio of cheeses was pretty good. Plus you get a choice of chips while you're waiting! And check out twitter for promo coupons as well. They had a buy 1 get 2 free deal, but we found out after we ordered.
Officially my favorite sandwich shop ever. The staff here are super cool, the sandwiches have clever names, they have tons of sandwich variety, their chips are awesome and holy moly they have Shirley Temple soda. My good friend took me here and his words of wisdom are those you should never forget when ordering, "Order 2 sandwiches, so you can eat one now and save another for dinner later." Trust me, you won't regret it.
Long lines, no tables, lights off and napkins and mini cups of water available only at the mercy of the guy behind the counter. No you haven't entered a Soviet canteen... Welcome to Ike's. I could let all of that go if the sandwiches were phenomenal but they're slightly above average. Not worth the hype.
sloppy sandwich that did not live up to the hype
Gluten free bread? Gluten free bread! I've got a gluten intolerance, bad, and they were very careful (they even warn you that there's a risk of cross-contamination: they know their stuff). I ate there and was just fine. Would I risk it everyday? No, probably not, but for special "I need a sandwich" occasions, Ike's is the place to go.
Ike's is the best sandwich place that you have to go to in SF. Each sandwich comes with a bag of chips and lollipop! Line can get very long, so order ahead. No tables in the restaurant so you can grab your Ike's and bring to Dolores Park. The vegan menu is awesome!
No one... No one... Can touch Ike's... PERIOD. No meat sandwich, no veggie sandwich, and no vegan sandwich on the planet... hehe ok maybe not the planet... Can compare to Ike's! They have so many choices for Veg's and Vegans. Don't believe try it for yourself and let me know how it went... I'm be waiting! Be prepared to wait for your order, but it's worth it... trust me! You can also call and order for pick up which is how I've always done it. Oh, make sure to TIP they work their butts off there, awhile smiling if that's not worth a tip I don't know what is! heheOh and if you see IKE give him a high five, because he is the MAN. lol
If you come for Ike's sandwiches, get something interesting. It's hard not to. It was my first time and knowing how the line gets, I ordered for pick up. I decided to try #200 Kryptonite (a la carte for $19.91). It's a "foot-long" dutch crusted bread filled with roast beef, corned beef, pastrami, salami, turkey, bacon, ham, fried mozzarella sticks, fried jalapeno poppers, fried onion rings, avocado, pepper jack cheese, pesto, and of course Ike's dirty sauce, lettuce, tomato, red onions, pickles and banana peppers. WOW - what a sandwich. It was an explosion of flavors - savory meats - tangy pickled stuff, fried textures and of course lots of creamy sauces. Pretty incredible. It was enough to serve 3 of us.I just realized that this was only "a la carte". Believe it or not, you can get the 2 other sandwiches with this one and order the Superman for $50. It includes the Kryptonite, the Lex Luthor ($17.71), and the Doomsday ($16.61), so it's a bargain to get "Superman" and pick up all 3. Just know that you really should share it with half a dozen people. You'll be many pounds heavier for sure.But awesome stuff. And there are veggie options too.
Awesome sandwiches! Really great veggie options. I highly recommend the veggie BLT!
I waited years before I finally had the opportunity to give Ike's a try. Perhaps I waited too long and my expectations were too high. Or maybe I went on a bad day. Either way I was not blown away or impressed as I was expecting to be. On the recommendation of the cashier at Ike's I ordered the Matt Cain on a Dutch Crunch and my hubby and son each had a Super Mario on sourdough. My sandwich was okay at best. The Super Mario on sourdough was tasty. I regret not forking over the extra money to try the Kryptonite. Maybe after the disappointment wanes and I find myself in the Bay area again I'll give it another go.
Ike's completely rekindled my love for sandwiches. Mmm, just the thought of their mouthwatering sandwiches makes my stomach growl.ATMOSPHEREThere's not much to say about atmosphere considering Ike's is now hidden in Lime, a bar/lounge that completely clashes with Ike's. Although I do appreciate having actual seating. It made my delicious food stand sandwich seem a little classier and chic since I got to eat it in cool pink lighting at the back of a lounge.The cashiers are very nice and helpful. It was our first time trying Ike's, so we were completely lost. We had no idea what to order but the cashiers gave stunning recommendations. The only thing I didn't appreciate was that they charged us $1 each for water. They failed to tell us that they had 2 options: bottled water and tap water. We assumed it was tap water, until I saw the receipt.Once the food comes out, don't expect any service. The wait staff is too busy trying to bag everyone's sandwiches to stop and answer any of your questions.FOOD1) Menage-a-trois2) 660 *not on the menu, but the cashiers know this itemThe Menage-a-trois (aka: the THREESOME) is featured on the 7x7 Big Eat Scavenger Hunt, so we had to try it. At first we thought it was called the threesome because it has 3 meats, but upon further inspection we realized that there was only 1 type of meat (halal chicken), but there were 3 sauces (honey, honey mustard, and DIRTY SAUCE), as well as 3 different types of cheeses (pepperjack, swiss, and smoked gouda). THIS WAS ONE BIG, SLOPPY, WET SANDWICH OF ABSOLUTE GOODNESS. It had a very distinct taste: it was sweet but still very savory. My only issue with it was how soggy it got. The 660 was a recommendation from the cashiers. All sandwiches come with the same veggies and spreads, but this one also came with AVOCADO and PASTRAMI. It was my first time trying pastrami and I am a fan. The meat was well-seasoned and although the sandwich wasn't messy, it was still packed with flavor. LOVED IT!I've been living in the Bay for 4 years now and I just tried Ike's for the first time last night. It is hands down one of the best sandwich places in the Bay. Don't be a fool like me-- make that venture out to the Castro and get yourself some Ike's. You won't be disappointed!
No place like Ike's place! Love this place!
I was very disappointed with this place. My sandwich was just so soggy and soaking everywhere. I think ill keep going to miller east deli..
Goodbye original Ike's place location.Hipsters killed Ike's. True story.
Great and tasty sandwich. Being vegetarian, Elmo is my choice. I generally exclude Cream Cheese from it...yep dirty sauce and freshly baked bread are the key. Interestingly Ike's sandwiches are a bit weightier compared to other sandwiches...makes me too full. I have been to only Foster City's Ike's...want to try Cupertino one someday. Enjoy!
Sure, you could very well get a sandwich somewhat similar to what you could get at Ike's for cheaper somewhere else, but still, I thought it was very well worth it and I would definitely come here again if I'm in the area (and of course, have enough $!). When I got here around 2pm, there were about a dozen people waiting in line before me and another dozen or so, on the line to the left, who had called and were picking up their orders. I ordered the SF Giants and this one was absolutely delish! It came with chips of your choice (got the Zapp's Voodoo Chips) and a caramel apple lollipop. The guy who took my order and the other guy who handed me my order were both chill and nice. Generally, the sandwich would be more than big enough to last you two meals. Have absolutely nothing bad/negative to say about this place - I'm glad I finally got around to trying this out:-)
This hole in the wall is definitely a place that should be visited if your in downtown sf! My husband and I were bit skeptical when we first pulled up but the reviews on here made it impossible to pass up! It's worth all the raves. I love the free chips and the caramel apple lollipop they give you with the sandwich. Ike's place was even visited by Man vs. Food from the food network! We ordered the mnage a tois (#111), and I'd definitely order it again on my next visit!
Great sandwiches -- I highly recommend the "we're only friends". The numbers on the board next to the sandwiches listed aren't a mistake. The other 100 or so sandwich types are listed in their full menu online. Be wary that the line is usually very long and the sandwiches very messy. Go off hours if possible, and bring a ton of napkins. Take your sandwich over to Dolores Park for a great afternoon picnic
Ike's was even better than I expected! I had the Damon Bruce with my boyfriend and it was DEEEELICIOUS! A little messy because of the lettuce but I loved it. Their voodoo chips are yummy, they're a salt, vinegar, and mesquite bbq flavored. This is now a go to place for me everytime I visit SF.
I LOVE IKE'S. Come here if you love meat. Come here if you're a vegetarian or vegan missing meat. Come here if you like sandwiches. I don't live in San Francisco, but I've been here three times in the last month. It's just that good. The bread (the most popular is Dutch Crunch, which I shall never stray from) is amazing. I normally don't like soft white bread, but it's got this great soft on the inside crispy on the outside quality that's reminiscent of a really yummy breadstick. The sandwiches tend to be pretty saucy since they have their "Dirty Secret" sauce, which is delicious. The menu in location is pretty small, but check online (or on their phone app) for the full menu if you need more options. They have an amazing array of sandwiches for meat lovers, vegetarians, and vegans. So far, I've tried the Meatless Mike (vegetarian meatball sub), the Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian (mushrooms, artichoke, pesto, provolone), the Purple B's Veggie CA- BLT, and Peg Bundy (a breaded eggplant delight). And all of them have been mouth-wateringly good. My best friend and I have been craving nothing else. The price tends to be around 10 dollars, and you get the sub plus some chips. Admittedly a little pricey for a sandwich, but it's around 9383292992 times better than subway or any sandwich I've ever concocted. Plus, way more filling. Come here and try everything. Seriously. And I almost forgot, it's TINY, so don't expect to eat your awesome sandwich there. Dolores park is super close and a nice spot to picnic with your Ike's.
I have to be honest, I only go here when we can get a Task Rabbit to pick up, but it's totally worth it!
they have the best sandwiches in san fran! I love this place the price is reasonable and include a bag of chips and STICKY caramel aplle lollipop! :Di remember there was one weekday afternoon me and my friend went to this place and the line was long cuz they shortage one more cashier but it wasnt that long to make me get impatient.. there was one guy maybe a manager apologized to everyone who was waiting in line and said feel free to grab a drink in the refridge. I thought this was really sweet and thoughtful!I love their Spiffy tiffy the most! my second favorite is Nacho boy!! sometimes grab a root beer with me. good lunch for chilling at the dolores park or watching a Giants game! :D
I came a little after the usual lunch time but saw a huge line! So what did I do? I reviewed the menu (because my goal is to try every single sandwich at Ike's) and ordered 2 sandwiches. I haven't had the Manage-a-Trois yet and the boyfriend loves Matt Cain, his 3rd time ordering w/o ever looking at the menu for any alternatives. Anyway- the music blaring from Lime made it a tad difficult to order.. I ordered and the pick-up time was 40 minutes later!! So we drove around until it was THE time to pick my order up and finally.. We arrived at my heavenly and most favorite sandwich shop ever. The boyfriend was lazy so I walked out to pick-up and pay for my order. I was greeted by the friendly girl at the register and a guy I always see when I am at Ike's.. Aaron, he introduced himself and signaled the girl to give me 1\2 off just because I am a regular and I drive an hour just for Ike's. I have withstand the hour and a half wait in line (just in line, not the after order and waiting for the sandwiches part) when Ike's was at their original location off 16th and Sanchez, I believe. Sandwiches... I can't tell you how much I love sandwiches. Being Asian most would probably assume my choice of complex carbohydrates be rice but hell-no.. I prefer sandwiches and I most certainly favor Ike's over any other place.. The service is always upbeat and friendly.I am on a quest to try good sandwich spots all over the Bay Area and I have and still on that mission but I have not been a regular to any except Ike's. Oh-em-Gee!!!!
I wish I never ever f*cking ate at Ike's Place because ignorance is bliss. NOW I AM ADDICTED! I hate that you guys are closing because of your neighbors. I will definitely miss this place. Once you guys relocate, I can complete my goal of finishing all of Ike's goodies. The line for this place is ridiccccc, but it is worth it. The long wait builds up anticipation and makes you salivate as you think about what sandwich you are going to order. Luckily for me, the first time I came here, there was hardly a line! The first sandwich I ate here was the Jim Rome. Deeeeeeelicious. I can honestly say that it was my favorite sandwich. Despite the cost of the sandwich, Jim Rome won my heart with the first bite. In my opinion, Ike's is like the designer brand of sandwiches. Two thumbs for Ike's.
There may be a line out the door, but it's really worth the wait!!! Yum!!!
Ike's is AMAZYING. Best sandwich of my life- seriously.My bf and I walked about 6 blocks to get here before waiting about 30 minutes to order and another 10 to get our food, but it was all worth it! When we first walked up, one of the servers noticed us looking at the menu board and immediately offered us a full menu so we could see all their hilariously named sandwiches. Another server (possibly the owner?) told us to ask any of the servers or himself if we needed any suggestions (seeing as it was our first time and all).We took a really long time deciding- (so many choices!), but finally went with an "Eli Manning".When we ordered, we were happy to discover that it was happy hour! (Between 6-8PM? or 7-9PM? We ordered around 7). Happy Hour means you get a free bag of "Dirty" chips and a drink per sandwich! The drinks include the fancy bottled ones, not just soda cans!When we finally got our sandwich, it was hot and HUGE! They had split it for us and each half was a full-sized sandwich at other sandwich shops! They even threw in 2 caramel apple candy pops! (:In summary: GREAT service. DELICIOUS food. GO @ HAPPY HOUR. & be prepared to WAIT IN LINE. but it's all WORTH IT.
Awesome sandwiches, but I rarely come here because I am only able to eat half of a sandwich, and if I save it, it gets all soggy and gross, so until they offer half sandwiches at better pricing or I have someone to share a sandwich with, I will not be back. They have excellent choices for vegetarians which most sandwich places don't, so for you vegetarians, that's a plus!!
Keyword: Every Sandwich is Great, Fav Sandwich: 660Coming to SF, you gotta visit Ike's deil. You basically can't go wrong with any sandwich. I think it's the combination of toasting the sandwich and their special sauce. Hey if almost 4,000 people had given this place 4.5 stars, they can't all be wrong.Favorite Sandwich: 660 (Pastrami, Bacon, Avocado,) .
SANDWICHES GALORE! SANDWICHES SA'MORE PLEASE! Came here on July 4th, and surprisingly the line was very short. There was about 5 people in front of us - so we're definitely very lucky. There are so many choices, I wanted them all. But I ended up choosing the Matt Cain (GO GIANTS!). The boy chose the Legend of Zelda. When you order you get your choice of bread. From what I remember, they had sourdough, wheat, dutch crunch, and some other ones I can't remember any more. You also get a bag of chips (the size that your mom use to pack in your lunches). The people that work there are super friendly and awesome. After about 10 minutes, we got our sandwiches, and boy oh boy did they smell delicious. We took them over to Crissy Field and devoured them. So bomb.com. I recommend everybody grab a sandwich from Ike's Place.
Decent. Nothing special, but pretty good sandwiches. To be blunt, I'd come back, but only if I happened to be passing by.
MMMMMMMMMMMHM~After the first time I tried this place, i came back here EVERY TIME i was in the bay area... (i heard it moved from its original location but the store is still aliveee!) I took every chance i had to drive up from los angeles, and seriously, you cant stop craving it!Recommendations: the three some (has some fancy french name but they understand) & the sandwich with turkey and pineapples (if youre into the whole fruits in your main meals kind of person like I am)Two of my guy friends got the KRYPTONITE to share... neither could finish their half... 1/2 is bigger than your head. Yeah, theres always ALWAYS a wait... but... lines are a good sign... getting kicked out of your old locations due to lines and such is a GOOD SIGN for restaurants... and... come on... 4.5 stars for over 3000 reviews is just BANANAS! i bet Yelp! was created just so the creators can share to their friends how amazing Ike's is... hahahahaah joke but you get it.
I think I just ate the best sandwich in my lifetime
Looking through the menu is definitely a task in itself. There's always something that you want that's in one sandwich, but not in another. They all definitely sound really good!We decided on: 1) Menage a Trois - halal chicken with 3 sauces (honey, honey mustard, bbq), 3 cheeses --I'm normally not a fan of bbq sauce but the honey with bbq was delicious! The taste did get a little tiring though. It was overall a very good sandwich.2) M.I.L.F - halal chicken, ranch, frank's red hot sauce, and jalapeno poppers. I didn't taste as much chicken in this, but the overall taste of this sandwich was OMFG DELICIOUS! My friend and I had trouble finishing both halves of the sandwiches, but if i had to choose which one to finish.. and I would choose the MILF. I really liked the red hot sauce and the jalapeno poppers. It wasn't spicy, but had a good kick to it.The halal chicken was a little sparse in my sandwiches, but it was flavorful and moist. I would also get all sandwiches on the Dutch Crunch. It's not hard or too thick where it would be hard to eat it or scrape the top of your mouth.Just FYI, if you call it in, call at 11am and you'll prolly get your sandwich at 1pm. We called at 11:20, had to come get it at 1:30pm. Or, you could go there and wait for 45min or so...Also, get your sandwich, walk 2 blocks down Church to Dolores Park to enjoy your sandwich then finish off your fantastic lunch with some ice cream from Bi-Rite. YUMMMM!Can't wait to go back!
Just like Quizno's, except you have to wait longer, it's more expensive, they don't have a pepper bar, and hipsters work there. Unfortunately, knocking the teeth out of hipsters and forcing them to swallow each one is against store policy.
Now that is how a sandwich should be! The wait is usually long, so I definitely recommend to call in to order first then pick up! The price maybe a bit painful to some, but I think it is decent. The double crunch bread is definitely the best! My favorite sandwich would be the "We are just friends" :D  Love the sandwich names!
Matt Cain. Enough said... Best sanwhich I've ever had in my life.
Simply magnificent. I have had many great sandwiches in my day, but Ike's is beyond the best. I'm thinking it must be their "Dirty Sauce" that does it, not sure, but their sando combinations and the overall freshness & flavor of every sandwich I've had from here are just top notch. There is a solid chance there's a huge line when you come here, but it's very much worth the wait. Even though I'm a strict turkey sandwich lover, they don't have toooo many turkey options here, but what they do have is amazing. I got a sandwich called something Romo, Jay Romo maybe, not sure, but this one is definitely my favorite. It has turkey, red pesto sauce, avocado, and whatever veggies you want (don't forget the dirty sauce too). Simply, magnificent. :)
Amazing sandwiches, just be prepared to order at least 1 hr in advance...
Been here two times. Good sandwiches, a bit pricey but still worth it. Loved the drawing :) Do note however that the line for it might be very long.
Just go here. Go here today if you can. Go here and try the Menage A Trois sandwich. It will change your life.
I remember when I loved Ikes . . .
Love the Mnage  trois!! Ike's is by far the best sandwich place I have ever been too!
[Name Of The Girl I'm Dating] on Dutch crunch. NOM!Was told they actually have a hundred or so sandwich selections (really?). Look inside the paper bag for a treat, and although it's a little pricey ($10 for a sandwich) it was worth it in my opinion. Came around 3:30ish and there was a small line- waiting in line during peak hours may make you want to scratch your scrotum in rage. Few places to sit so recommend this to-go. Only street parking available so far as I can tell, and not too many spaces at that; feel free to correct me as I was a useless resource-sapping tourist who used public transportation during my stay in SF. If you can take an alternate route past the Divisadero traffic before it turns nto Castro that would probably help you retain a level of sanity that is not harmful to society.
Ike's is the best!!! I am a total sandwich goddess and had to come back to Ike's for round 2. Thanks to my awesome co-worker- we got our sandwiches in 15 minutes instead of an hour fifteen and they were amazing. This time around I went with the Hot Mama on Dutch Crunch. Franks Red Hot, Provolone, Ranch (I freaking LOVE Franks Red Hot and Ranch dressing, OMG), Chicken and all the fixin's. The chicken is ridiculous, almost like it was marinated or rotisserie chicken I have no idea but just try it. I HATE getting sandwiches with fatty weird chicken meat... not okay.The only thing that annoys me is when I order sandwiches and they got soggy before I eat them- but I am a sauce whore and if you like sauce on your sammy it is bound to get a little soggy. The Dutch Crunch is amazing.Anyways, enough out of me- get over to Ike's and try one for yourself :)
Love the menage a trois. It's pretty sweet so not for everyone but is awesome. The dutch crunch bread puts it over the top.
What else can I add to the 5k+ reviews, apart from agree with them. The menage a trois, hot mama, and mlf were all up to par. The voodoo chips recommended by the cashier weren't anything special, but she was a real doll. The service there was great.
They're OK. Five stars compared to Subway, but I'll take anything from The Sentinel compared to Ike's. Just make three good sandwiches instead of three dozen bad ones! I really wanted to like this place, but their food is not as good as their marketing.
2nd time at Ike's at this location.This time I had to wait in line (30 minutes) but it was worth it. I got the Name of Girl I'm Dating with everything while my friends got the veggie Menage a Trois.While we waited for our order, two of my friends went to a nearby liquor store to get some beer and then we headed over to Dolores Park to enjoy our sandwiches.The Dirty sauce is what make the sandwiches AWESOME!
the sandwiches are okay but if you'd rather not pay $13 for an instagram pic and dad jokes about a menage a trois go to literally any other deli. if you do go, order using their app ahead of time bc the line is too long
Aside from the Little Lucca's in South City this has to be my favorite sandwich place! It's definitely hispterville, but ugh it is SO good! I have never been disappointed at Ike's. Their dutch crunch is the best! And the dirty sauce is so damn good. My favorites are Spiffy Tiffy, Holy Name Panthers, and the Jim Rome. The red pesto is one of the best sauces I've ever had. One day I'll be brave enough to attempt the Kryptonite aka heart attack split in 2 sandwiches.Note: Each sandwich comes with an apple caramel lollipop and a bag of chips.
There was 2 pieces of cardboard in my Spiffy Tiffy sandwich instead of a mushroom. The bread was also a little stale.
Omg, I had to come here to see what all the hype was about! And I wanted to taste the "Dirty Sauce" baaaad! When we came here, there was a line! Not too long of a line, but I was surprised that there was a line!They had a big menu behind the big glass window and it was the "Good Looking Sandwiches" I was offered the real menu by one of the workers. Wow, they had so many options I was confused as to which one to get! Finally decided to get the "Nacho Boy" which consisted of Hot roast beef, avacado, swiss, mushrooms.We didn't know but it was Happy Hour! Which meant free chips and drink! Wow so coool! The place is small no seats whatsoever and we can't block the sidewalk! I say the sandwich was good, but it isn't really worth the expensive price! The cheapest was like 9.99. And mine was 11.99. It is kind of pricey. They should make happy hour sandwiches too! Like 50% off or something then I'll go everyday of my life ! HahaBut there was a sweet worker there that informed me about the different sodas they had since I wasn't familiar with their drinks. I go the sugar cane Cola! Delish! And they put a lil lollipop in your bag too! How cute! And I couldn't really taste the dirty sauce since my sandwich had too many flavors! I am contemplating on getting the Super Fat Bastard next time though! Worth a try , but not necessarily the best on earth. Little Luccas has better price! and biggeRR!
I don't like sandwiches much but I LOVE this place. The sandwiches are interesting and so tasty, they have great potato chips. The atmosphere is lively and fun! I don't have a lot to say because I don't really like sandwiches that much but if you do....give this place your love!
Amazing! All of it, every bit of it. Great staff, great sandwiches. But a long line??? Deal with it, its that good.
This completely unassuming little sandwich shop is the most reviewed restaurant on Yelp and I'm throwing them their 4149th review today. Oh yes.Yesterday, my afternoon was spent in Dolores Park, eating a sandwich so big and so messy and so delicious. Ike's came through. My pal Jeffrey S and I swapped halves, so I ended up with part Spiffy Tiffy on the Dutch crunch bread (chicken, pesto, avocado, bacon, provolone, pepperjack, etc.) and part [Name of Girl I'm Dating] on sourdough (honey mustard, chicken, avocado, pepperjack). They were good. HOWEVER, what you should do is get one of the $19.91 sandwiches that you can find on the online menu. They are actually two sandwiches, and include toppings such as mozzarella sticks and jalapeno poppers. You can also unlock secret menu items on their website. What? You're not on your way already?! Well, I can tell you more, I guess...The service? Superb. There was a line out the door (it's my assumption that there always is), but the guy taking my order was a pro and friendly to boot. You can also pre-order your sandwiches if you don't want to wait as long. There's very little room for eating in, so Ike's is best left for takeaway outings.
So 3 Stars is A-OK, which in my book means I can eat at this spot on the regular with no prob. After eating here for the first time (#118) in the past week I definately did not get the 3 star A-OK feeling. It was more like - Meh ie: 2 stars.With 4K Yelp reviews - not sure if these folks have taken the time to experience the other sandwhich shops SF/SF Area has to offer. For the record - While in SF I play tourist and show friends around SF who live farther away than I do - When it comes down to the factors of visiting Ikes - location (a ways from Union Square or the Marina) , parking situation, possibility of a very long wait, overall TIME.I have determined - crossing the Golden Gate Bridge as most Tourists & I do when in SF. It is worth it for me, for my taste buds along with my friends to go to Davey Jones Deli in Sausalito for a sandwich.Nothing against Ikes - they have their niche but we all have our preferences...But If you happen to venture to Ike's I have three tips:1. Go on a weekday after lunch (to minimize wait time)2.  There is a bench to sit on around the corner from Ikes (near the school & street parking) - if the sun is out, it is pretty comfy - just make sure you do not litter!!3. Try Davey Jones Deli during the day you do the GGB & let me know if I am wrong.
soooooooooooo bomb!!!Jayme sandwich, enough said
Almost anything recommended by Guy Feiri is worth trying; Ike's Place included!My friend & I stopped by Ike's on a beautiful Thursday for lunch. While waiting in line (the place is quite small, so lines begin at the door and along the building), we checked out the signatures that were posted on the glass windows. I don't know which was more eye catching, the sandwiches or the names! When we finally got a hold of the ONLY menu, we had to let a couple other customers go first since we had the hardest time deciding what to order. Items such as "The Ex-Boyfriend," "Not Tonight, I Have a Headache," were all appealing, but my friend and I eventually decided to go with "Menage a Trios." Moist grilled chicken, honey mustard, natural honey, veggies, BBQ sauce, the "dirty" sauce, and smoked Gouda layed upon warm, toasted dutch crunch (my FAVORITE!!) bread. Excuse my language, but to quote my friend, a bite into an Ike's sandwich was "orgasmic in my mouth." Smokey flavors complimented the sweetness from the honey and the dutch crunch while the herbal aioli "dirty" sauce lingered after each bite. Little Lucca, you've just been bumped to 2nd place, sorry!
If i didn't care about my salt intake or my principle of not paying more than $8 for a sandwich (and chips), I would go to Ike's more often. Putting the above aside, I'm just rating Ike's for the pure deliciousness of it. It is delicious.
Please note that it is now called Ike's @ Lime because Ike's had to move away from the residential area due to huge lines and commotions that their customers (being us) causes. lolI think it was great concept to temporary relocate Ike's @ Limes because they probably get a lot more customers (some people the people who hang out at Limes for drinks and parties). Plus Ike's is known for its hip-like feel, which parallels the vibes I got from Lime. So, I liked the ambiance a lot.My only disappointment is that there remains to be, no seating...so you can either bum around on the streets, eat a park or seek shelter at a nearby cafe/restaurant. However, I would say, the neighborhood is quite unique and is worthwhile to stick around. (my friends and I saw a man puking, pretty much right in front of us!) Also, probably due their superb sandwiches and popularity, there is quite a long wait. Give or take 30 minutes.Okay, now the real reason why we came here, Ike's SANDWICHES!They have a wide selection, ranging from vegetarian, vegan, carnivore diet and omnivore choices. However, in my honest opinion, you probably go wrong with any of their sandwiches. Note, their sandwiches are generally ~$12, and come with complimentary pirate's boot potato chips (various flavors for your choosing). I also saw many people leave with a bottle of root beer, so it is probably also good.My friend and I decided to order THE Superman because the lady at the register told us that it is big, 2 full sandwiches at the price of 1, so we decided, why not?! (Note: my friend let the lady taking our order "grind" against her, so I am not sure if the superman is actually 2 sandwiches or if we got a "free" sandwich. lol. so, you should ask if you order the superman)It was incredibly filling, all kinds of meat, the works and their famous dirty sauce--in all their sandwiches (which is probably what makes their sandwiches so good). I thought their sandwiches are succulent and crispy and their meats were fresh and juicy. I also liked how their sandwiches did not get soggy and still tasted good when retoasted. Despite all these positives, I don't think it is the best sandwich I have had. Although, this may differ each individual have different tastes and preferences. Overall, I think Ike's a must-try, especially after hearing the raves about it.
Definitely the best sandwich I've ever had. Don't remember the name of the sandwich, but it had chicken breast and wing sauce. Maaaaaan that thing tasted like hot wings in between two buns, but (dare I even say it) EVEN BETTER. If I lived any closer to the place I'd probably gain 200 lbs from having it for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
I split the Kryptonite with someone for both lunch, and dinner. Thing is massive! And so good! I love Ikes!
Went to Ike's Place on a trip for a friend's wedding and when I got home all I could talk about was the sandwich (and the bread) that I had when we went to Ike's. My wife and I are vegetarians and finding a place like this that has dozens of REALLY GOOD vegetarian options isn't just hard to do when out of town, but damn near impossible. I had the normal bread and my wife had sourdough and we both think we had the better bread. I'm now trying to figure out how to fly back out there for something else so we can visit there again.Do yourself a favor and visit Ike's a few times, regardless of wether or not you live in SF or not.
Okay, I'll admit it. I was a skeptic.  How good could a sandwich be? It's nothing more than bread, veggies, meat, cheese and a spread made up of some combination of mayo, mustard, garlic, herbs, etc.. Seriously. Like I haven't had a good sandwich a few times in my life? Well on my last day of vacation, I decided to treat myself to a sammie at Ike's, the Matt Cain on Dutch Crunch (I'm a huge fan and was so happy to see the sandwich named after him was to my liking). I drove up and found some parking spots right out front, a great sign of things to come. There was no line at 11 am on a weekday. Another great sign!  The guy that took my order was super friendly and super nice.  Super funny too! I picked up a bag of the Funky Fusion chips (BBQ-like) and sat down at the bar to wait for my order. During this time I noticed that the staff was super helpful and friendly to the other patrons, regulars and newbies alike.  After a 20 minute wait, the sammie arrived, with the Godfather sauce on the side, as I had requested. The thing weighed a ton but I didn't care. If it tasted as good as it smelled I was in for a treat!A couple of hours later, I was finally able to dig into the beast of a sandwich. Oh my. Toto, we are not in Kansas anymore! I don't know what it is, but the sum was definitely greater than its parts here. The meat, veggies, bread and two sauces together were simply AMAZING! I'm so glad I asked for the Godfather sauce on the side as I'm now able to dip veggies into the leftovers. Make sure you have plenty of napkins! The lollipop was a nice suprise!If you are unsure of what to order, ask the staff. They have some good suggestions. The menu is pretty huge and includes meat, veggie and vegan options. It's probably best to call ahead and place your order over the phone during the busy hours to avoid the lines. One can easily see that they love what they do and have a good time doing it. I find that translates well to the product they deliver, no matter the industry. Now I fully understand all the hullabaloo about this place. Yup, I'm a fan!
I have gotten a few items off this menu and frequent this place during iunch time. My favorite sandwich is the Lex Luthor...a little pricey at $18.00, but the sandwich should last at least 2 meals. The line is ridiculous even at odd times so always call in your sandwich ahead of time. I've gotten their VM a few times but have always gotten an answer within 3 consecutive calls. I've ordered from Ike's @ Lime roughly 6 times and they have only screwed my order once (added onions and peppers when I ordered my San Fran Cheese Steak with no veggies) which I forgive them for since they are insanely busy and there sandwiches are heavenly. It's a take out only establishment and it would be nice to have a sitting area.So, basically there sandwiches are not cheap..but you get what you pay for..easily the best sandwich in San Francisco. There menu is extensive and the weirdest combinations end up tasting the best.
This place is the YUM! No wonder it was feathered on Man vs. Food! :)Huge variety of sandwiches to pick from. . . I wanted to get the Ex-Boyfriend cuz it sounded cool but when I got to the counter, the cashier guy said I had to get the menage a trois (aka 3 Way lol). SOOO GLAD I got that!!! It has shredded halal chicken breast, real Honey, honey mustard, BBQ, pepperjack, swiss, and smoked gouda on dutch crunch bread. =9 A bit messy...but absolutely DELISH! The fiance got the pastrami sandwich which was overflowing with meat. That was also good but not as good as mine!!! =P He got his sandwich free cuz it was his bday. Very nice of them....We sat on the sidewalk and ate cuz they don't have seats. So cool things about this place - there was a homeless guy that walked by and they just gave him a free fresh sandwich. Also, they recycle everything including compost. *heart*
Best sammies in SF!
I had one of the best sandwiches of my entire life in this place when I went on a weekend trip to San Francisco. Sauce was soo good! and bread too....
Great sandwiches. A bit hyped with a crazy long wait, but the sandwiches are solid.
Amazing sandwiches. The SF Giants is the quintessential sandwich in my opinion. Bacon, Avocado, Mushrooms, Swiss Cheese, and Turkey, all melding in the mouth to create a culinary adventure unlike any other. I seriously love this place and I cannot wait to keep coming back for some sandwich action.
I can't explain how good these sandwiches are. Of course, who would pay 10 dollars for a sandwich if it didn't taste as good as a 10 dollar sandwich would. I took my friend suggestion to order ahead. We hung around the area, got a beer and by the time we finished a beer, our sandwich was made.
One of the best sandwich places I've been in my life.Madison bumgartner = AMAZING! The rib eye was delicious and the habanero and marrying of all the flavors was just one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.Coming home for thanksgiving is also a definite favorite!
Where do I begin?! Nothing and I mean nothing tops an Ikes sandwich. My fella even knows if he is ever in the dog house all he has to do is come home with his puppy dog eyes and and Ikes Sammy!
This place rocks! I have been going here for a number of years and the staff has always been super friendly even with the vast amounts of people that are always packed in their location. The food is well worth the trip, and the prices are great. The massive list of variety is something to behold, if you can think of it they have it. The lack of seating isn't a bad thing since there is an amazing park just a few blocks away.
Fantastic sandwiches! So far I've tried the meatless mike and the tony soprano (italian), and both were delicious.To shorten the wait, call ahead to place orders to be picked up.
Waited in line for an hour. But the sandwiches were worth it.Like reviews before, the dirty sauce was the shiznit.Love the huge vegetarian and vegan menus.Staff were friendly and it seemed to be a fun atmosphere, even with the lineup on the sidewalk.Friggin amazing sandwich. Not much else to say.
Pure awesomeness !
Dutch Crunch bread on any sandwich=amazing.not much space to sit in the restaurant
It s just a place to order sandwiches and then leave with them. The wicked sauce is very good. I wish I lived in San Fran and could eat here often. Ive been craving Ikes every since Ive been home.
A place known for their sandwiches. I had the "Name of the Girl I'm Dating" sandwich. It was a little too dry for my liking but since I loved honey mustard I got it. I do recommend the Elvis Keith. The chicken in this sandwich was amazing and it was also not as dry as the first sandwich. There's a hint of wasabi mayo, not enough to make it super spicy, but enough to give it a little kick in your sandwich!
My friend and I decided to go to Ike's Place for our first summer food adventure, and we were super glad we did. We came around lunch time on a Monday and the lines weren't that bad. I definitely recommend looking on their website for their menu before going though, I noticed that it made their lines faster. I ordered the "We're Just Friends" (Halal Chicken Breast, Sweet Orange Glaze, Avocado, PepperJack) on dutch crunch and it was literally heaven in your mouth. Their dirty sauce is definitely a key ingredient in making their sandwiches tasty, but I think overall, the sandwich would have been tasty. They give you lots of meat and the right amount of lettuce, tomatoes, condiments, etc. I would go here again whenever I'm in the area or in the mood for another foodie adventure and try another one of their specialty sandwiches, especially since there's so much to choose from.Only downside, they don't have tables so you can sit and eat... but if it's a nice day, just walk on over to Dolores Park and enjoy a picnic.Oh and your order comes with a bag of chips and a caramel apple lollipop :)
F*ck yeah, I'll be back. Good selection of pretty much everything you want.
creative unique sandwiches- sometimes too much bread and too much sauce- love the bay area pride
No matter what time of day, what day of the week, there is going to be a line 30 people deep. So, my advice is CALL IN. I called in at 12:30, told that the sandwich would be ready by 1:30. Got there, go straight to the register, picked up the sandwich and be on my merry way. There is no other way to do this.I got the Iffy Tiffy sandwich on Dutch Crunch- $9.99 with a bag of chips. There is a huge selection of sandwiches, so there will be one that will fit your needs. Taste-wise, it's fine...although I must say that it's not really worth the 1-hr wait if you really had to stand in line w/ a starving stomach. P.S. No place to sit to eat! I think the sandwiches at Little Lucca's (in SSF) are definitely better and a lot cheaper.=======Review #134
Oh..Ike's place..why can't you be open till late. It's Ramadan and you close right before fasting ends. Why deprive us of having the fab halal sandwiches :(
This was really worth the wait. The best sandwiches I have ever had. Their turkey sandwich is my favorite. I'm not the only one praising about their sandwiches. Read their reviews. Highly recommended to all friends and family.
The name of the girl I am dating on Dutch crunch was amazing!!! I dream abt going back to San Fran just to indulge in this amazing sandwich! The sandwich is huge, but I ate every last delicious morsel. A bit pricey, but worth every penny. I just wish there was a nice place to sit down and indulge in this culinary masterpiece. (The restaurant has no seating). Someday I will be back...if only in my dreams!!
i'm a vegetariani've had about 8 good sandwiches, 3 mediocre, 1 bad at 4 different locations. hit or miss at times but usually good.
Want more than just your average sandwich? Want a sandwich that will leave you rubbing your stomach while your teeth shine glimmering white? Well the sandwich may not leave your teeth shimmering white, but you will love yourself for enjoying every last bite. Ike's essentially is San Francisco in a sandwich. AKA it has a huge variety, the sandwiches are diverse, and sometimes they may even seem strange, but in the end, they're all awesome.
If you want a normal sandwich don't come here. If you want a sandwich with crazy fixins (I'm talkin onion rings, mozzarella sticks, strawberry preserves, wasabi mayo, smoked Gouda, and mushrooms to name a few) and a ton of personality come here. Like everyone says, waits are forever (look up there menu online and call in, plan at least an hour wait into when you'll actually want to eat). My most recent trip to Ike's was prompted by 7x7 (a SF magazine focusing on everything that is SF). They have made a list called "The 2010 Big Eat SF: 100 Things to Try Before You Die" and put Ike's as #100 featuring their Menage a Trois (so naturally I had it, delicious as expected)! For other Yelpers who want to work on eating their way through the list, it is here - 7x7.com/eat-drink/2010-b Happy eating!
Pastrami charmed.. Was great! Had it on Dutch crunch, and the flavor blended together well. The ingredients were fresh and tasteful. I only gave this a four because the lines are so ridiculously long. We waited for an hour and a half, and production was slow..and they shouldn't be taking orders of 48 sandwiches for one person in rush hour lunch..Other than that, the sandwiches are very good. You get a small bag of chips and a caramel apple lollipop.
I had to stop by Ike's for the last time before its eviction out of the 16th & Sanchez spot. My boyfriend and I are crazy, so we came to Ike's at 10:30AM. Honestly, who has sandwiches at 10:30 in the morning? But we read on the newspaper that the wait was 2 hours long over the weekend, and it took 30 minutes to get the sandwich, so we wanted to come prepared. Luckily, there was virtually no wait this early in the morning. We also came here on a weekday (Friday), so that helped. I ordered the Eli Manning per the employee's recommendation. I love that the workers know their sandwiches so well, and always so nice and helpful with their suggestions too. Eli Manning was delicious - even better than Ike's signature Menage a trois. The key to the sandwiches is baking the dirty sauce into the bread, which MUST be Dutch crunch if you want the best sandwich experience. Everyone needs to stop by Ike's to get his/her last sandwich before it moves away!
One of the best sammys in the city. Grab a "we're just friends" and pop a squat on the sidewalk.
This is the perfect lunch spot, there is no other way to put it. When you pass by and notice a line out the door, you know it has to be good. Here's a tip, go on the website first to view the entire menu. They have a dozen or so sandwiches written up at the store, but there are a hundred or more when you go online. Food was delicious, service was great. My sisters mentioned they were splitting a sandwich and the cashier went ahead and cut the sandwich, wrapped them individually and gave them both a lollipop! What a nice guy! I was only visiting San Francisco but next time I'm there I'll definitely be stopping by Ike's Place
If you want to have an orgasm via sandwich, GO HERE! This is a must when visiting San Francisco. Lizzy's Lips is my favorite sandwich!
This place is the mecca of sandwiches in San Francisco and the reviews don't lie. I don't know who Ike is but he knows his stuff. I had the Spiffy Tiffy and it was delicious and filling (I was only able to have 1/2 in a sitting). Of course I recommend the dutch crunch bread and the special sauce. Keep in mind that there is very limited seating at Ike's so you might have to grab a space around the neighborhood to enjoy your sandwich.
One of my best friends introduced me to this place, and she's a sandwich connoisseur. And she's right; this place is my favorite sandwich shop I've tried thus far, ever. The sauces are absolutely amazing in the sandwiches, which makes it unique and original (not to mention, heavenly). If you don't mind the extra calories, always go for the dutch crunch bread! You will not be disappointed in any of their sandwich options (their vegan selections are just as yummy too)! My to-go's would have to be 'Menage a Trois' and 'The Name of the Girl I'm Dating'.
Been to both the redwood city and SF locations. Great bread and killer sando's.
This was by far the best sandwich that I have ever had. My stomach is so content that I could never eat again and I would be satisfied. I had the SF Cheesesteak and is was made by the hands of god. Based on this review, I hope you all share the experience with the rest of the city. Enjoy!
after hearing raves for this place all over the internets, i made it a priority to stop in the last time i was in the bay area.I got the Lincecum and the Matt Kain. Since i was only in town for one day i wanted to be able to taste more than one sammy. i had them cut each sammich in half and wrap the halves separately. both were delish, of course, even cold the next day. i dunno what's in that dirty sauce, but i'm gonna call it magic sauce from now on.added bonus:Surprise caramel apple pops in the bottom of the bag for desert! Yummy!
The Chicken Pai Thai is awesome. Best I ever had.
Pretty amazing, as always. My new favorite is the "Big Lee-bowski", which isn't a posted sandwich but is spectacular. Only problem - probably 4 days' worth of calories.
Best sandwich every!!!!!!!!! LOVE better describes how I feel about this place!
It's hard to imagine changing the perception or image of this place at this point give the extreme popularity, but here's an honest, concise review for you.Bottom Line: Average sandwiches, low meat-to-condiment ratio, average-quality ingredients. You'll definitely find some tasty sandwiches on the board, but don't be fooled that you are paying for anything other than standard deli fare with hyped-up names and special sauces. More Detail: I've tried four different sandwiches from Ike's, and was unfortunately not impressed. They are average, and there is nothing wrong with that on some days, but realize they're not curing any of their meats nor baking any of their bread. You could easily re-construct any of their sandwiches from the local Safeway. For not bringing anything unique to the table and having higher than justified prices, they get 3 stars. Barely. You're also paying for chips whether you want them or not. Trust me, they're not free.P.S. The Halal chicken they use in their sandwiches, at least the one I had, was dry and stringy, lacked seasoning, and filled me with extreme regret.
I feel so wimpy for only getting "The Change" for my first time here. It's just that everything just seems a bit overwhelming at first and I was not prepared as my GF and I waited in line. I thought it was totally awesome that the staff entertained us with random trivia and awarded answers with line cutting, lolipops and t-shirts. The sandwich itself was absolutely delish. It wasn't overwhelming, but the bbq sauce and combination of onion ring crunch with ribeye steak was amazing. There wasn't too much going on my sandwich. I didn't know that I needed to order onions and other stuff. I've got to try something else. I think next time that I come I will be better prepared.I also really liked the chips that they have available. I ended up with some bbq chips but they weren't "bbq" chips. They were something else, I don't remember. My GF got some jalapeno chips that were good and spciy. I look forward to coming here again and getting something more adventurous. I'm sure with such an extensive and unique menu that I will find something amazing.
This is an awesome sandwich place located in the Castro. I came here around on Saturday around 5 PM and there were maybe 10 people ahead of us in line. The wait was no more than 5-10 minutes, but I bet it was much longer around lunchtime. I ordered a Menage a Trois, with added avocado (halal chicken, lettuce, tomato, honey mustard, bbq sauce, and swiss/cheddar/pepper jack cheese). WOW SO GOOD! All of their sandwiches are served hot and contain their legendary "dirty sauce." I couldn't believe how tasty it was. It got pretty messy at the end though since the sandwich was falling apart. Your sandwich order also comes with a bag of chips and a caramel apple lollipop. All in all, I guess we were lucky with the extremely short wait, but I'll definitely be back even if there is a long line!
These sandwiches... are just... sent from heaven.
Amazing subs! They are huge though so make sure you have an appetite!
crazy size and crazy combo. #2 spot for sandwich in the bay
All I can say!! "Menage-a-trois" on Dutch Crunch w/ a little dirty sauce! lol
It's worth the wait!I was a bit dubious at first, seeing the long, slow-moving line and a story by my friend, who mentioned it can take an hour to get a sandwich (!!) But then I looked at the amazing menu: 100 types of sandwiches. And yes, they're all different. Fun names, too. I really don't think you could go wrong with any of their sandwiches. The staff is so kind, chill, and helpful. They don't seem rushed - or if they're rushed, it's not in a way that makes the customer feel anxious, too. You could definitely share this sandwich with a friend (but why would you? It tastes so good). I recommend [the Name of the Girl I am Dating] and the Ex-boyfriend. How ironic!
I have no idea why people love this place so much. Most items are completely doused in greasy sauces that obscure the flavor of the ingredients. I only ate here once and couldn't finish my sandwich.
AWESOME sandwiches!!! Love this place, always get the Hollywood sf cheesesteak. Sooooo amazing!!!
Best unhealthy sandwich you will find.
once again I have to praise Polk Street Produce. the owners Harry and Jon care deeply for the health of their clients. Golden Veggies on California and Polk care about sugar, older veggies, and impulsive buying. They actually copied Harry and His Polk Street Produce. True, Harry is with certain items expensive. but for the quality to the body it is well worth it. I live on Social security and Veterans Pay and while I cannot afford all I want. he keeps me in FRESH veegtables and fruit. He is true hope without money being his main guide.Love, timothy gallagher
These sandwiches are worth the wait!!! Def get the portugese bread. Yum. I got something vegetarian and it was perfect! Brought the sandwich to mission dolores park and ate it while people watching on the hill. This place rocks!
They've got a buttload of sandwich combinations and the names to go with it. They have a chatty guy at the register and a cute boy come up to you with your sandwich. They'll throw in a caramel apple lollipop too. They have something for everyone. They know how to treat their customers well and they know how to make us happy. What more can I say? It's hard not to like this place. Despite all the good things they have going on for them, it comes down to the food for me. I had the Eli Manning and I was a bit disappointed to find my chicken breast and avocado mushy and not the tender pieces I hoped for. The garlic herb sauce indeed made the meat creamier, but I didn't taste much garlic. In general, the sandwiches here are too wet.bottom line: I like Ike, but I don't love Ike.
Food-wise, this place is the tits-magee. I love the "Nacho Girl" (salmon sando), which is off the menu, and the "Going home for Thanksgiving." Ike's will also give you a bag of chips and a lollipop to go with your sandwich, which is icing on cake, but probably a drop in the bucket if you are paying $13 for a sandwich. Still, the food here is amazing, especially if you get it fresh.The one downside, is that if you are a regular person who likes to eat between the hours of 11am and 2pm, you will have to wait like 40 minutes to get a sandwich. I went there once on a Saturday and instantly drove home because the line was like 30 people standing on the sidewalk. That said, you can order from their nifty (yet pretty jank) iPhone app and then just pick up your delicious sando.5 stars cause the sandwiches are bomb, and I already know about the lines so I plan accordingly.
I've had both the M.I.L.F sandwich & Spiffy Tiffy Sandwich. SOOO DELICIOUS!!The first time I went, there were only 2 people in front of us. Beginners luck? haha! Probably because we went on a week day and right before the lunch rush came in. The second time around, I came after class and arrived around 12:30.. not a good idea. I think we waited a little under an hour. WORTH IT! Definitely going to do a phone order next time.
Came back over the weekend to give Ike's another try. Success-ish. The sandwiches seem smaller now for some reason. It's probably just my imagination though. I always order the Hollywood Cheesesteak and add mozzarella sticks to it. Yum! My family, on the other hand, prefers the Elvis Keith. It has a very very slighty kick of wasabi to it that's barely noticeable. The sweet terriyaki chicken is a great combination with the kick of the wasabi mayo. Next time I'll definitely order this again and ask them to make the wasabi taste more strong. Now they have free chips with every purchase, which doesn't REALLY justify the increase in price but, hey, they need to pay for their legal fees so I guess we should support them.
I love Ike's sandwiches. I don't eat there a bunch, but man is it tasty! It is a togo sandwich place so I usually get my sandwich and walk over to Dolores Park. When the weather is nice, it is a great way to spend the afternoon. I love the "Name of the Girl I'm Dating". Yum.
The sandwiches were among the best i've ever had. Unfortunately, the service was among the worst!No outdoor seating and staff were incredibly rude. I sat on the steps in front of an apartment building to eat my delicious sandwich. Apparently they don't like that. I'm sorry, I thought this was America. Fuck you, Ike's.
I LOVE Ike's! While I rarely indulge in the consumption of bread, when I do decide to treat myself to a sandwich - only the best will do - Ike's!! Every selection I have made has been better than the next -you simply cannot go wrong. Everything is warm and toasty and simply delicious!
This place is famous in the Bay Area and I would have to say over hyped but good. The sandwiches are pretty good. Its a place to definitely try a few different sandwiches. The sandwiches are good, definitely a step up above Subway, but you can find other independent sandwich shops that make pretty good or better sandwiches at a much cheaper price. Its the sauces that usually give most of these sandwiches their flavor.However, I will only eat here once every few weeks because there are a few things that really bug me.1. The sandwiches are over priced. They are anywhere from 9 - 13 dollars and with chips and a drink you are looking at a $16 lunch. That isn't realistic for everyday. 2. The lines are ridiculous. You are looking at a 30 minute wait. While the sandwiches are good, it drives me nuts that you will see 12 employees all making sandwiches in the back yet it still takes about 30 minutes for me to receive my food and people who ordered well after me somehow will get food before me.3. The employees. While the employees are generally friendly this place tends to only hire hipsters with funky mustaches, weird tattoos, messy/dirty hair, and bad hygiene. I usually stop by the new Oakland Ikes and while the employees are nice, I don't really care for the fake, "how is your day going" talk they try to initiate when you are purchasing a sandwich. My other issue which has pretty much stopped me from eating at Ikes are the hygiene of the hipsters. I don't like being grossed out by the hipsters who are hovering over my sandwich with big scruffy dirty beards or really long unkempt hair and mustaches. They just also generally look like dirty hipsters, even wearing cut off dirty jean shorts, bike hats, and sweaty stained shirts. Just imagining a mustache hair falling from one of those guys into my food has creeped me out far too much.4. A lot of hipsters work in this place and in general I almost feel people can't walk in the door here without some sort of crappy tattoo or hipster cred.All in all a good place to try but I don't recommend it as a regular place.
What else can you write that over 4000 other people haven't?Just a good sandwich to eat. Slightly on the higher end of prices for a sandwich, but it's a huge sandwich and it comes with a choice of chips. At $10+ a sandwich, it better be good and it does deliver. Plus, it's filling enough that I don't really need to each much more the rest of the day so I can live with the price. The "dirty" sauce is like crack, so make sure you get it on the sammy.Line is ridiculous, so plan on standing in line for awhile especially at lunch time. You can always call it in and pick up, but it still takes awhile. Worth the wait though and I don't mind a line when I have nothing else to do.
Actually worth the hype. If busy, call in order, walk around Mission and have a coffee/tea/lemonade. Pick up your sandwich and bam...good times.
Their gluten-free sandwiches make this the destination cheap eats in San Francisco for Celiac's sufferers. YUM.However, make sure your order is gluten-free. Ours was not, indicated by the suspiciously fluffy bread. Gluten-free bread is normally quite flat (without the gluten, natch) and harder than regular bread. However, when we pointed this out, they apologized profusely, put our names on a "not-so-secret list" by their register, and instructed us to come back whenever we wanted for a free sandwich, chips and drink. Class!As for the rest of the staggeringly long list of sandwiches, I have eaten several and loved every single one. This is among the best sandwich places I have ever eaten. The line is intimidating, but order by phone and they will give you a time to show up to get your order to go without the long wait. They also deliver, if you are in the mood to sit on the couch in a snuggie, watch reruns of Law and Order, and pig out on an entire sandwich by yourself without the hassle of leaving your house.What? LIKE YOU DON'T.
Ahhhhh Ike's. You really can't say enough good things about this place. They make a mean sandwich, have a solid sandwich shop feel, and the service is great.I didn't go to Ike's for quite some time since I figured it was all hype. However, after having the MNAGE  TROIS and the DOOMSDAY I was throughly impressed with the place (you can call in orders too which is nice).The sandwiches are huge so don't expect to hit up Bi-Rite or something afterwards because you won't have room :p The MNAGE  TROIS is a great simple elegant sandwich. Everything is just right about it from the chicken to the bread to the cheese it's a can't miss type of sandwich. In contrast, the DOOMSDAY is quite the opposite. They simply took every ingredient from the kitchen and placed it nicely between 2 slices of bread :)There are a bunch of other sandwiches on the menu so I'd recommend trying something new when you go back ;p
Maybe it's just me, but I don't see what's so amazing about Ike's. It's a decent sandwich, but not any better than what I could get at other non-chain sandwich places. I find the chicken a little dry. If you're concerned about the amount of calories you eat in a day, I wouldn't come here. Also, prices have steadily gone up and now I find that it's a little too expensive for a sandwich.
Ike is great! and sandwiches are delicious.
As if Ike's Place needs another five-star review.You're not going to learn anything new from me. Everything that has been said is true. I want to crack the sandwich-numbering code. But beyond that, I'm going to enjoy my vegan meatballs until the cows come home, which they will, because they haven't been killed to make non-vegan meatballs.
I've been wanting to come here for the longest time and i finally got my chance to try this place out today. Walking into this place, there were no where to sit, long lines, and a lot of customers waiting for their order to come out. When i got to the register, the cashier guy was super friendly and helpful. He suggested the Matt Cain and the honey bbq sandwich (i forgot what it was called), I loveddd the Matt Cain sandwich! It was delicious and all the meats inside meshed together perfectly! On the other hand, I didnt quite enjoy the honey bbq sandwich. I highly suggest Ike's and it truly hits the spot!!
I had to see what all the hype was about with Ike's Place since I have heard nothing but incredible things. I didn't feel like waiting in line so I decided to phone my order in but when the guy on the phone told me it was going to take 1.5 hrs, I was thinking "Are you freaking kidding me???." Ironically, that made me want to try one of their famous sandwiches even more so I stuck it out. Boy am I glad I waited because hands down, it was the most delicious sandwich EVER!!Veggie SF Giants ($9.99) - I got this baby on a Dutch Crunch roll and split it with my sister...their sandwiches are monstrous! Somehow they ran out of avocado so ended up charging us $1 less. The vegetarian turkey and bacon were surprisingly satisfying. The cheese and mushrooms coupled with the Dirty Sauce just melted in my mouth. Yuuuum! (yelp.com/biz_photos/dold)I swear their Dirty Sauce was like crack and pretty soon, I was licking my fingers and wondering where my food went. The free lollipops didn't hurt either, although I was hoping they had the caramel apple ones. (yelp.com/biz_photos/dold) I can't believe it took me this long to discover Ike's Place since it opened in 2007 but better late than never. Can't wait to come back to try another one of their tasty sandwiches and praying I won't have to wait as long!
Living in Southern California, we have plenty of food options available. And while I will say that the overall food selection in SoCal craps on what NorCal has to offer, you will not find a finer sandwich anywhere in Golden state then at Ike's.While the most popular sandwiches are listed on the actual menu at the store, be sure to check the website for their full menu. Each sandwich comes with their "dirty sauce" which is a delicious garlic ailoi spread. There are several breads to choose from, but like the reviews say, stick with the dutch crunch. I personally recommend the Spiffy Tiffy, as the halal chicken is delicious although you really can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches. If you are truly feeling adventurous, try out the Lex Luthor, which comes with everything your mother told you not to eat as a kid. You can ask any of my friends, that when it comes to waiting in line, I am very impatient and will often times not eat at a certain restaurant, shop at a certain store, ride a certain ride, because of a long wait time, however, Ike's is the exception. On a busy day be expected to wait around 30 minutes from the time you get in line to the time you get your food
Excelent!!!, the best The Count Of Monte Chase-o !
I have a new love and it's Ike's. With a list of over 100 sandwiches (each one just as good as the last) and a sandwich like the doomsday ( Roast Beef, Corned Beef, Pastrami, Salami, Turkey, Bacon, Ham, Mozzarella Sticks, Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers, Avocado) .. Well first off, how could ANYONE possibly eat that much?!You get your choice of bread (wheat, sourdough, dutch crunch, gluten free), fillers, sauce on top of the already packed sandwich fillings. Don't be put off by the dirty sauce, I don't even like creamy but you can still get the dirty sauce, just ask no mayo and you'll get the cold version without mayo! STILL DERICIOUS. My friends and I walked here all the way from the greyhound bus station and were not disappointed even with the long line you still won't have enough time to decide which sandwich you want! I guess if you're a veteran you should just call your order in to avoid the line, but I think waiting on the line is necessary for your first time. It's a good experience.Everyone is really nice from the girl who takes your order to Ike himself who comes out and hands you your sandwich himself (: We took our sandwiches to Dolores Park nearby and ate our sandwiches in glory. You will be nice and full after any of these sandwiches, I got the Eli manning (Halal Chicken Breast, Zesty Garlic and Herb Sauce, Mushrooms, Avocado, Cheddar) and the chicken was so perfectly moist and juicy my mouth wouldn't believe it. They make the bread so nice and crispy just like it should be. God. My mouth is watering right now. Also, enjoy the little apple caramel pop. It's such a nice gesture. I love you Ike's. I love you so much.
Let's just say , I can't wait to go back to Cali.
There are 1600 reviews for Ike's Place- how can I make mine stand out? Maybe I should I write a haiku?i wait in the linethe sandwich maker feeds metrue love has been sharedNahh... That's kinda freaky. How about I write a poem?There is a location, close to mineWhere flocks of followers waitTheir leader is a man, not a GodBut his creations are those of the heavensHe feeds our hungerA hunger only he knows how to satisfyDirty Sauce will consume youAnd all you get is a free lollipopOK, now that was way to deep... How about some more modern? Let me make a Rap!Yo yo yo... I'm going to Ike's Placebout to stuff my face!bacon lettuce cheeseextra Dirty sauce please!so many options, i'll get filleda Manage a trois or a MILFHome for Thankgiving or a Changethe Lincecum is insane! If you wanna eat rightYou better go down to Ike's!Well hell, that might have been the best of all... still terrible.Ike's is all the things you've read about and more. First and foremost, Ike is an insanely nice dude- it appears he personally hands over his sandwiches to each customer and chats with them, thanking them for visiting. Last time I came, Ike threatened to keep my sandwich and eat it for himself- kind of a silly joke but it's great customer service that keeps people coming back! And of course, the sandwiches are HUGE and made with top notch ingredients. Whole avocados, slabs or meat, onions rings and mozzarella sticks. The dirty sauce is delicious, and yes, you want extra.Call ahead, that is the best advice I can give you. The line can take up to an hour- CALL CALL AHEAD. And please, if you haven't visited yet... go today. 5 stars, great customer service, huge delicious sandwiches- One of the coolest locations in San Francisco.
Mill's Viking is one delicious sandwich. Meat and other stuffings soaked in sauce was just amazing.The line went quick, but the wait was still pretty long.
[Name of Girl I'm Dating], Tony Soprano, The Catch, Paul Reubens, Mark Cuban... CHOICES CHOICES CHOICESLike I said before, even if you are a vegan or a vegetarian, even if you are allergic to GLUTEN, even if you are the pickiest eater on earth, there is SOMETHING FOR YOU HERE. And not just something... something AMAZING.Errrr please, don't go actually. Makes me wait longer.I love how Lime was bumpin' the club music hella loud! I think there was a DJ. People were dressed up for a Saturday night in the middle of the day... Ike himself was there to take a picture with my friend. Not to mention the food... yummmmm. All in all, a one-of-a-kind lunch experience!
THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!! , Caters to anyone , vegan , Muslim ,Jewish , vegetarian , great sandwiches , great service , wish I could go more often ,
There's nothing I can really say that hasn't already been covered by the 4000 other reviews so I'll just throw in a disclaimer for when patronizing Ike's.Follow the rules! That sounds stickler and oh so "supporting the man, man" but it's not without reason.Stay off the neighbor's stoops and steps while in line, and remain in a straight line where you're not obstructing foot traffic.I get that you're in the Castro and people think they're Jerry Garcia and John Lennon reincarnated and want to be free spirits, but these simple things to abide by keep Ike's from feeling heat from their neighbors. Which in turn keeps them open and here for our delightful sandwich adventures. With that said, enjoy the greatest sandwich of your life!
I'm perusing the TV guide and I see Man vs Food is an episode on San Francisco, I must watch it of course. It's half way done and I see my friend Ike from Ike's Place and I got excited, I've been there! To get technical I've been there about 30 times. I felt accomplished knowing I had given 5 stars to a place Travel Channel found worthy of their show.For old times sake, nostalgia and all of that, I pulled up my review and found *gasp*, I still only had Ike's at 4 stars? WTF is wrong with me?? I was a bit jaded at a soggy sandwich it seems, but the more I thought about it I asked myself what sandwich won't be soggy if it has to travel 30 minutes before it's eaten? If there is sauce involved it's going to soak into the bread, that's just the way it goes.To think I knocked the epic deliciousness of Ike's by a star due to something out of their control. Shame on me. Will you forgive me Ike? Pretty please?
Unfortunately, I never took the opportunity to go when Ike's had its own building (and was not a part of Lime). I wish I had, because it probably would have been a different/better experience for ordering/eating the sandwich.When we got to Lime, we weren't exactly sure what to do. This guy, who didn't even look liked he worked there, gave us a cheap-looking paper menu and instructed us how to order a sandwich--which is basically going to the register located right at the entrance of Lime and telling them what you want. This was just kind of weird because I didn't know what to expect and you pretty much order a sandwich then wait outside for them to give it to you. You can eat the sandwich at Lime in the lounge area if there's space. It seems like Lime gets crowded even before 12PM. It's not a very good place to eat a sandwich if you want a calm environment because it gets crazy in the building with people yelling/drinking during lunchtime. Because of all this, I'd probably give this place a 4.5.The sandwiches, however, were pretty delicious. I'd recommend the "Hella Fat Bastard" or the "Manage A Trois." Also, for sure get the Dutch Crunch Roll or Sourdough Roll. I wouldn't hesitate to come back and get a sandwich here.
Smackin' sandwiches, totally worth the wait. Only place I'm willing to pay $10 a sandwich.
My friends and I were going to spend an afternoon at Dolores Park, so we decided to get sandwiches from Ike's. Ike's is a happening spot, so be prepared to see a gang of people waiting out front. Instead of waiting in that line, we just called 20minutes ahead of time and picked up our order. We got the Menage a Trois, Papa Sam and Spiffy Tiffy. The Spiffy Tiffy and the Papa Sam were awesome. I really liked how the salmon in the Papa Sam wasn't too fishy, yet you knew it was salmon. I was too full to even try a bite of the Menage, but my friends said it was dank.Recommendation: call in an order and by the time you walk/drive there, it'll be done
All time favorite sandwich spot. The best there ever will be.
love, love, love ike's! the first time I ever had a sandwich here was about a year ago when I was still a tourist. I was a bit annoyed at first because I found them to be little pricy (didn't realize yet that I was in a densely populated city), so I was hoping it would taste fantastic. I was not let down. I have only ever gotten the menage a trois and the love triangle, both of which feature honey goodness and chicken or *vegan* chicken, and they are both HEAVENLY. my mouth is watering just thinking about it. my only wish is that they had indoor seating, but I love it all the same :-)
DOOMSDAY - unreal. Simply the best sandwich I've ever tasted. Mnage a Trois was amazing too. How anyone can give this place anything less than 5 stars is beyond me. Dreaming about my next Ike's experience...
I've been to 3 Ike's locations now and 2 out of the 3 have had insane lines (45mins-1hr). The SF one is worse than the other locations I've tried. Ike's in SF is literally a hole in the wall with no seating. Just buy your sandwich and either eat it on the sidewalk or take it away. We found a bar close by and had a couple beers with our sandwich.On to the food:Overall I feel Ike's is decent. They definitely have unique sandwich names (menage a trois, fat bastard, name of the girl i'm dating, etc) and ingredients (fried mozzarella sticks, jalapeno poppers, and onion rings), but putting that aside I didn't feel like Ike's was really four or five star great. Meats and veggies always seemed pretty fresh, bread was ok (i usually get dutch), and dirty sauce was a nice bonus.I would go back to Ike's, but being the sandwich lover I am Ike's isn't a place I crave a sandwich from. I do have to say the caramel sour apple lollipops are a nice touch though.
I'm a big fan of sandwiches, and I'm usually the type that enjoys a simple roasted turkey with a slice of cheese and lettuce, then call it a day. But after experiencing Ike's Place, my standard criteria for sandwiches hasn't been the same ever since. Ike's is the true definition of scientific culinary arts. The pairing of sauces is what I like best about their sandwiches. Mnage trios on dutch crunch bread is usually my go-to when I come here. All of their selections are pretty hefty, so I would suggest sharing a whole order. UNLESS, you've built up quite an appetite that day, then I say eat the entire thing; you definitely won't regret it. All in all, I give this place a five star and will continue to frequent this gem whenever I feel like I deserve a reward.
After to two years of craving a sandwich from this establishment, I have to say...I am extremely satisfied. An Ike's sandwich was the best birthday gift ever!
"WAIT WHAT??? IKE'S IS GONE! NOOOO!!"I wanted to die. I'm from SF and has never tried it and they had to close... what? They moved to Limes? GOOD SHIT.Me and a bestie went there the past weekend around 1pm. Long-ish line but it was worth the wait! We luckily found parking around the corner (not meter! whoo!) We ended up getting a Manage-a-trois on dutch crunch bread. SO GOOD. The real honey definitely gave it a sweet kick in the sandwich! Sadly we waited kinda long to eat it because we took our time walking to Dolores Park so it sogged up, but it was STILL GOOD! So folks, if you guys are to buy Ikes, make sure to eat it asap!I am really thankful that Limes let Ike's use their kitchen. The line was long, but it wasn't bad when you're listening to club music from Limes!
So good... Heaven between two pieces of dirty-sauce-soaked bread. Quite possibly the best sandwich I've ever had. Oh wait, I forgot about Bakesale Betty's... Okay, tied for the best sandwich I've ever had.I got the Sanchez College Prep on sourdough... the BBQ sauce was the right combination of sweet and slightly hot, the cheese deliciously melty, the bread the right amount of soft interior but crunchy crust.The wait is incredibly long to order and then again to get your food, but the staff is very nice as are the fellow patrons so the wait doesn't seem as long as it actually is.The sandwiches are large and maybe $2 more than the sandwiches I get in the financial district for lunch. But my $8 financial district sandwiches are sad, small, uninspired versions of sandwiches. Ike's sandwiches are interesting, large enough to only eat half and save the rest for later, and include chips.
Meh. Seasoned salt on everything, tricky sauces slathered on everything, and way too expensive for what you get. I suppose if you're baked it seems like a good idea, but not my thing. There are better sandwiches out there.
the pook is currently on a sandwich kick so we decided to come to the original ike's place today. packed the car and went with some friends to see if the redwood shores location really does make it the same as the original.. and yes.. yes they do! the line to order was about an hour... maybe a little more. it was a beautiful day so it was nice to actually be outside to enjoy it. apparently they changed the ordering system.. they actually have the register outside the door and you wait outside for your sandwich. if you order over the phone you can go right up to the door and let someone know.i had the "change" on sourdough with no peppers or pickles. this is my new favorite. i used to always pick one with the chicken but i am definitely a fan of change.. hehe. it came with thinly slice rib eye steak, smoked gouda, beer battered onion rings, and bbq sauce. ok so normally i dont like bbq sauce but for some reason i was cravign it today. i just wanted something with alot of flavor and i definitely got it with this sammy. i liked the onion rings in it the best. it went so well with the bbq sauce. just a a warning.. this sandwich is MESSSSSSSSSY! the pook ordered the "get over it" on a french roll. this is what he got last time. the best part was that he ordered a "name of the girl im dating" but added mozz sticks which was the "get over it" sandwich so when they brought out our order there was some confusion. ike had to explain that the way he ordered his "name of the girl im dating" made it into the "get over it" sandwich. but hey... at least he knew that he would like it. it was just so funny cuz he was trying to order something different from last time but ended up with the exact same sandwich. the wait to get our sandwiches was about 10 to 15 minutes. not bad... we walked to dolores park and enjoyed our sandwiches on the grass. it was a good walk to help digest cuz the boys devoured their sandwiches while the girls ate half and saved the rest for later. i will be back to bring another friend here cuz its nice being in the city.. but i definitely will take advantage of the redwood shores location when at work...love that everyone is so nice at both locations. it always a treat to see a smiling face :)
Came here during my vacation, and It was pretty good. The bread was nice and toasted, their sauce was pretty good, i am pretty sure it is just a blend of spices and garlic and maybe some mayo not sure, since they call it their "secret sauce". The quality of the food was really fresh. The sandwiches come with your choice of chips and I chose the Sea salt and vinegar chips, warning they are very vinegary. I definitely would come back here. Also just a tip, it is so much better when the sandwich is warm, so don't think it will be just as good if you are planning on saving the other half for the plane ride or some other time.
We were spending the weekend in the city and wanted to take a picnic to one of the many parks. So we went onto yelp. And I am so glad we did. We stumbled upon Ike's. It is a sandwich like no other! Absolutely worth the price and calories!!! We will come back to Ike's every time we go to SF for now on! It's a new favorite of ours!!!
For our holiday group lunch we ordered Ike's Place sandwiches. I got the "Change" sandwich number 132 on their meats menu - Sliced Ribeye Steak, Beer Battered Onion Rings, BBQ, Smoked Gouda on Dutch Crunch with everything on it. It was phenomenal! I guess you could say it changed me! I'll never look at another sandwich the same way again. The ribeye was juicy and deliciously perfect with the smoked gouda smothered in that BBQ and dirty sauce. It all worked so well together I savored every bite. The portion was just right, enough to get me through a late dinner. Now I know what the hype is all about... Thank you and Happy New Year to all my fellow Yelpers!
Awesome Service and Sandwich Creations!
At the risk of repeating what others have already said about Ike's Place, I'll try to boil it all down to a couple of nuggets:1. They serve crazy flavorful sandwiches. There's no one thing that they've got going for them; it's the sum of the parts. Dirty sauce, toasty rolls, perfect proportions, shredded lettuce, the list goes on.2. Ike is a rock star. He takes 1-2 minutes out of his harried life to look you in the eye, thank you for patronizing his place, and tell you how much he loves the sandwiches he sells. God bless him. I wish every biz owner was like Ike.3. The lines are ridiculous. It's stupid, really. It makes zero sense to wait this long for a sandwich. And yet...4. The menu is absurd. Sorry, Ike, but you don't need to put it on your menu just because it's possible to make. It's very stressful. I'd rather you just tell me what to order. And yet...I will be back. Regularly.
Thank you Ike's for not letting me down!We decided to give Ike's another try. This time around we got the 'Fat Bastard' which includes the following:*Ham*Bacon*Extra Dirty Sauce*American Cheese*Lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, banana peppers and jalapenosWe had it on their Dutch Crunch bread. After taking a single bite of the sandwich I knew I would have to re-rate this place on Yelp and give it its well-deserved 5-star rating.Let me explain it to you folks, Ikes is about 2 things, their fresh baked bread and their Dirty Sauce. This particular sandwich really emphasizes the Dirty Sauce and how well it works with the bread. In fact I read somewhere that they bake the dirty sauce into the bread which probably is what gives it its fantastic flavor.The bread is baked fresh. All of Ike's sandwiches are toasted. My sandwich had a crispy exterior and a nice soft interior. After taking a few bites I could sense a hint of garlic and other flavors that I couldn't put my finger on. Nice warm bread, mixture of textures from the crispy and soft bread made this sandwich a winner.The ingredients tasted fresh as well and I was happy that the bacon was crispy and not soft. We had the good fortune of getting to meet Ike and chat with him for a few minutes. He's a very nice guy and we got the scoop that there will be an Ike's place near Stanford. Sweet! I won't have to go as far to enjoy these delish sandwiches.I think I'm going to be sticking with my choice of the Fat Bastard until I muster up some courage for some of Ike's other creations. This place definitely lives up to the hype!!
Bomb.com. and that's all I have to say about that!
One of my favorite sandwich places since my friends introduced me to them a couple years ago. I have also spread the word amongst my friends and coworkers. No one has ever been disappointed.My all-time favorites are the Menege Trois and the [Name of the Girl I'm Dating], but you would be hard-pressed to find one that is not tasty. Given it's popularity, I would definitely recommend calling in your order a couple hours (yes, a couple hours) and pick it up. I also love the vibe - everyone seems to love what they're doing and that goes a long way in my book.
Its always hella crowded for a reason. Almost everything on there menu is worth it.
Ike's sandwiches are the bomb! Came here for lunch last weekend and tried 2 different sandwiches. Before you start to judge, my friend and I split and shared 2 different sandwiches. Yes, I'm a fatty, but I'm not THAT bad.Anyways, I had half of an Eli Manning (halal chicken breast, garlic and herb sauce, mushrooms, avocado, cheddar cheese) and half of the Ex-boyfriend (salami, bacon, cheddar cheese, avocado). We got both on dutch crunch bread, which was nice and crusty on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. Both sandwiches were excellent, and I really can't say one tasted better than the other. In fact, they were so good, I nearly inhaled them. The chicken in the Eli Manning was very moist and the sauce gave it great flavor. The bacon in the Ex-boyfriend was nice and crispy and went surprisingly well with the salami. You can just taste the quality of the ingredients in these sandwiches. Everything is fresh, flavorful, and delicious!Now, if you're planning on going to Ike's I would highly recommend looking at the menu beforehand. There's 157104147457834 sandwiches to choose from and with that many, you don't want to be pissing anyone off behind you while you contemplate. And believe me, it will take you a long time to decide because they all sound good! Except for maybe the Dirty CA Roll.... not sure about that one. You can call your order in, but when I tried that, it took me about 10 minutes just to get past the busy tone and maybe another 10-15 minutes on hold. And after all that, they said phone orders were backed up by 2 and a half hours.It was nice to see Ike handing out orders to everyone. I'm so sad I don't live closer to be able to try more sandwiches on a regular basis. I'll just have to do the best I can whenever I'm in the city. If you live relatively close, definitely stop by! And don't be intimidated by the line. It does move and it's worth the wait!
My students could not believe that I had never been to Ike's. They had no problem waiting for sometimes an hour to get their sandwiches. Not one who cares much for obscenely large sandwiches I was reticent to go. But when a friend was visiting from Seoul and had heard of Ike's, we went. At first I thought it was utter chaos. People were standing about but finally I figured they had already ordered and were waiting for their food. The number of choices amazed me bit so did the sticker price. It is hard for me to justify a $12 sandwich which is mostly a large roll. I do not deny my choice, The Lincecum, ws good but I had to take home 1/2 of it and later that evening it was soggy and unappealing. Would I go back? Probably not. I prefer fewer tattoos and more organization. Call me old. Fine. It just wasn't as amazing as others have proclaimed. I think there are better places for a meal in SF, many other places.
good!!! really yummy, juicy, delicious, very different! love their soft drinks too :)
DOWNRIGHT ONE OF THE BEST SANDWICHES MY LIPS HAVE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE OF GOBBLING UP!driving to the place in the middle of that odd neighborhood.. we thought we were lost.. "where is this place"... friend: "could it be that massive crowd and line ahead".. THERE IT IS!get in line! order then wait around until they call your name! you'd be lucky if you got o sit on the only two tables they have.. which are both outside.. better idea is to get TO GOwhat to order? WELL GEE I DONT KNOW. there's OVER A HUNDRED sandwiches on their menu all w/ unique names!!!! good thing the line was long because it took us forever to decide.. honestly it doesn't matter what you get... the 6 of us each got a diff sandwich and they were ALL DELICIOUS!i got the yelp recommended "name of girl i'm dating" we also got "fat bastard" "SF giant" "pizzle" and i cant remember the rest! for a little less than 10 bucks EACHget the sandwiches on the DUTCH CRUNCH bread.. it is soOOO tasty with their secret dirty sauce baked in w/ a PERFECT crunchiness!!what ever they put in that dirty sauce.. it is just tooo good.. nough said(like enilorac k. said.. WE NEED AN IKE'S IN LA)
Sooooooo goooooood. The only problem is the line goes out the door which takes about 15-20 min then you order, and have to wait another 10 to make it. I can tell their staff works really hard. The ingredients are just wonderful, many vegetarian options. ( I personally love the meatless mike) I say you call in your order and just walk past the line to pick it up. I think the big hype on Ike's is all the different options and variety in the sandwiches. I appreciate their work at Ike's.
I've been by it so many times but the lines are so long that I've never been able to go. Go early in the morning or during non popular times so you don't wait in line forever!
I will be the first to say how much I love Ike's. I am very excited for them to open their new location in Southern California. I have introduced countless friends to Ike's over the years when they visit me in Northern California. The creativity of the sandwiches and the add on options are so cool! I will note, though, as of late, they have messed up my order a couple of times. Nothing serious, tomatoes on the wrong sandwich and jalapenos when I ordered them for the other sandwich, regular chicken instead of the fried chicken I asked for. I will add that I was ordering on the phone though, so there just might have been an understanding...but it has happened 3 times. My recommendation? Order in person and wait patiently for your glorious sandwich madness and you will not be disappointed.
The "Hot Date For Hire" sandwich definitely lived up to all the hype. They also offer Jones Soda, which is a plus. We called in our order so we could avoid the line (Which I highly recommend). Delores Park is conveniently a few blocks away, so if the weather is nice you can walk there and enjoy your cleverly named sandwich.If the sandwiches weren't enough reason to visit, you should definitely come to see the cute worker who resembles a skinnier, less hairy version of Adrian Grenier :3
WORTH THE WAIT for sandwich LOVERS.I ordered: The Count of Monte Chase-OHam, Turkey, Strawberry Preserves, Swiss for $8.98.I know, it sounds nuts to put strawberry preserves on a sandwich. Strawberry and turkey (well, that's kind of thansgiving-y). Strawberry and ham? Think of sweet glazed ham with pineapple. The thing is: IT WORKS! You get the sweet of the Strawberry with the savory of the meats, pickles, peperoncini... all wrapped up in a SOFT Dutch crunch roll--the softness is vital, because otherwise the fillings would slide out every time you try to take a bite--and here, even though the sandwich is very thick, you can bite through it and the fillings stay put (you do need a number of napkins, however).One of my favorite sandwiches of all time is the famous Monte Christo Sandwich, popularized at Disneyland's Blue Bayou restaurant. This is a ham turkey and cheese sandwich that's battered and deep fried, and served with jelly (think of it as a French toast sandwich--and to avoid disappointment, please note that the Blue Bayou now only serves this wonder at lunch, not at dinner). While I loved it as a kid, the last time I had one I thought, "This is just too much, the battering and frying and all that, kinda greasy..." So now along comes Ike's Place with their Count of Monte Chase-O sandwich, which is basically an un-fried Monte Christo that's utterly delightful (not to mention edible)--AND WORTH WAITING 40 MINUTES FOR.I know it seems unbelievable that it's worth waiting 40 minutes for a sandwich, but it is.Why?I'm guessing that the secret ingredient is probably "Love" or something intangible, though people seem to think it's the "Dirty sauce" baked into the bread. What impressed me was 1) standing in line was a communal experience--it wasn't like waiting in line at the supermarket, everybody was talking to each other, about food--that was great.2) There are way too many sandwiches to choose from. This is a good/bad thing. Good because, hey, it's a lot of choice. Bad because, hey, you have to make a decision!3) Everyone who worked there was super-nice. Not just "nice" but super-nice, like they were your best friend from grade school and so happy to make you something to eat. Even when I asked seemingly dumb questions they've surely answered 4,324 times that same day, the lovely tiny woman who took the order explained it all to me as if she was happy to do that. I'm not sure how a business manages that, though I imagine it has all to do with Ike's leadership (as these things tend to start at the top), but he should bottle his dirty sauce, and his management techniques! 4) The sandwich was totally original and supercalifragilisticexpialidociously delicious. The way everything was layered, the way the bread was fresh, soft yet toasted warm, somebody just knows what they're doing!5) The sandwich is huge and easily makes two meals. Have half for lunch. Take the other half home for dinner (it's good hours later after being gently warmed in the trunk of your car--I know, this horrifies some people who can only imagine non-refrigerated meats but we all know how good sandwiches can be like this!).DANGER: Ike's may find it spoils you for all other sandwiches everywhere, in which case you may have to move into the neighborhood.Otherwise, wait in line, eat, then smile!
Friendly staff and a sandwich sized and priced for 2. Maybe it's because I'm a Chicago guy, but I prefer Potbellys. But, Ikes will definitely fill you and then some with options for anyone.
Whoa. Best deli sandwich I've ever had. I'm not sure what the sauce is on the Tony Soprano, but it's 100% yummy. The ambience is ... somewhere between 'funky 'and 'odd.' Which is to say, it's typically San Francisco. Ike's a deli that operates out of the kitchen of a tragically-hip, all-white, Miami Vice-esque restaurant with a trip-hop sound track ('Someone Like You' by Adele). It's not exactly family-friendly, but fun for adults. We patrons are asked to sit in the back under the way-dirty skylight. Service can be sporadic. There are two entirely separate wait staffs in the restaurant. It's confusing from whom to order. Still I'm giving this place 5 stars. The sandwiches are THAT good. P.S. A bag of potato chips come with each meal. I had the 'Funky Fusion' chips. They are not that 'funky' - just tasty well-seasoned chips.
It's definitely worth the fame! I had a sandwich Change which was AMAZING and my husband had Menage a Trois which I thought the flavors were incredibly complex and interesting but maybe too sweet for my palate (my husband loves sweet, so he loved the sandwich). It'd be better if there were some tables to eat there, maybe it wouldn't fit their style, but it's not easy when you are a tourist and after getting a sandwich there you dont know where to go and eat it. But we will definitely be back when in SF, cant wait to try the other sandwiches!
Delicious!
So friggen good!!! Also a great place for vegans! Go check it out!!!
Today you guys get a 1. Not because the sandwich wasn't good, because if I had actually gotten a sandwich I know it would be a 5 just like always. No, the reason you guys get 1 star is because after being on hold for 20 minutes, I am told that an order would not be ready for another hour and 45 minutes. I know you guys are busy as hell, but a little heads up about the wait beforehand would have sufficed.Thank you for wasting my time today guys.
[M]ona: 4 Stars[W]ayne: 3.5 StarsAverage: 3.75 Stars+ Extensive Menu+ Accepts Credit Cards+ Good Service+ Filling- Hard to find parking[W] Today we were craving for subs....more like I was craving for some subs....and Mona suggested Ike's Place. My buddy had gone here before and he said he liked it as well so I was like "why not, 2 recommendations should be worth it."This place is pretty much in the heart of the Castro, or at least like a block away from it. I ordered a "Change" which was Rib Eye Steak, BBQ sauce, Beer Battered Onion Rings, and Smoked Gouda. Mona had the "Say hey" which she'll get into that later. The sandwich was pretty damn good but there was so much sauce that it soaked through my French bread! Now I can't decide if that was a good thing or not because we didn't even get a table to sit at! Well in actuality, they have 2 tiny tables outside of the store with like a handful of chairs.[M] It was cold and freezing so I wanted a hot and toasty sandwich. I decided on "Say, Hey" (Hot pastrami, Swiss cheese and bacon) with avocado on Dutch bread. Dee-li-cious! Although mine wasn't as saucy as Wayne's, I'm glad mine wasn't as messy as his cause we only had so many napkins lols. Oh yeah~ each sandwich also came with a complimentary lollipop. It was caramel apple today.[W] We ended up eating in my car which was not great but not bad either since it was freezing outside. We got to listen to the radio and have the ass warmers on. How luxurious! When you order here, I recommend checking out their website and decide on what you want ahead of time and order for pick up, otherwise you can expect to wait at least 10-15 minutes before your sandwich is ready. Everyone keeps saying "They have a bigger menu at the store rather than their online site" BUT when we got there, the menu was pretty much the same. [M] You can also call ahead of time to save the hassle of finding parking and waiting for your sandwich to be prepared![W] While we were waiting we got a chance to stroll around the block ONCE haha. You can go shopping if your quick...or if you're Mona, she wanted to go some in homosexual sex shop for some ...... mmmm yeah i'll pass.....That would've messed up my appetite for my food. She saw some large contraptions but that's another story haha. Back to uhh sandwiches...yeah....[M] LMAOZ, I'm no horndog! AND it wasn't even a homo sex shop~ you know you wanted to go check it out too hun! lols XD[W] Haha, another thing about this place is that there is NO parking AT ALL. If you're patient, feel free to circle around many times like we did until you're lucky to find a spot. OR if you're with someone, feel free to drop them off first to order while YOU'RE looking for parking. That's pretty much how bad it was. Other than that, the staff is pretty nice and they're always happy to explain what's in their sandwiches. I was surprised that the hostess automatically knew what meat and everything was in our sandwiches, but I guess that shouldn't be a problem when you're serving up the same order for 8 hours a day.
Nacho girl. Dutch crunch. Also: Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian. Half for now, half for later.
Normally I give about 3 stars and rarely 4 stars, but wow this place is DAMN YUM YUM. I got #18 Matt Cain with Crunchy Dutch (?) and added in banana peppers. It was so huge, I only ate 1/4th of the sandwich and was pretty filled already. The meat was so flavorful and seasoned and omg...the bread..nothing but love for it. Plus the godfather sauce was quite something There customer service is the best I've ever received! He was so nice and patient with my friend and I because she's allergic to nuts, milk and a whole bunch of stuff. She couldn't eat any of the side chips so they let us get a soda instead. Plus he explained everything to us what was what. Anyway, as someone who lives in San Jose, I'd drive to San Francisco for this place.
The new place is swarmed with college kids! The guy at the counter needs to improve his attitude when it comes to crowd control, he's a bit rude. I know it's a tough job, but they should get someone more mature. The crowd outside can get big and bothersome for the neighbors, but it doesn't help when the counter guy comes out and YELLS at everyone! I don't like the new place, I have a feeling they will get some issues with the neighbors again. I liked their temporary place on Market, but I'm sure that wasn't feasible to keep it there. Anyways, still a great sandwhich, hope they get a better place with the large amountof people they get. OH! one more thing, didn't see a complete menu, I think they are pushing people to download their APP and browse it that way.... pretty kool idea!
All hail Ike's, the best sandwich place ever! I travel from the East Coast just to eat the sandwiches here. The kryptonite sandwiches will bring any mortal (or Super) being to their knees! It's so tasty you can't stop eating it, and by the end, your gut will feel like bursting, you will have no energy, and you can't do anything but keel over or take a nap. I love good sandwiches, too bad there's nothing on the East Coast that comes close to this place.
New(ish) space, same amazing taste! I love Ike's! Whenever my sister visits from San Diego the first place we go to is Ikes. Even after I found out I had a sever gluten allergy - this is STILL the place to go. I can get my favorite sandwiches on the delicious gluten free breads they have. The store is only 2 short blocks from my house but these suckers are so good that even while juggling my dogs leash and a bottle of water I am still able to get the whole sandwich in my belly before I even reach Church street. My dog is always hella jealous of me.
I've been getting the Pizzle every time since I've first discovered this mouth orgasm. I haven't decided to try anything else due to the fact that the pizzle is the muthaf****** sh*t so yeah. Git da pizzle ma nizzlez.
Awesome and healthy vegan sandwiches. (They also have regular vegetarian and non-vegetarian sandwiches as well.) we have had several different sandwiches so far and they have all been delicious.
Best sandwich I've had..probably ever. Don't settle.
C's Deli is my favorite deli in San Diego. Ike's Place is my favorite in the bay. My first time here, I got their BLT with their house bread. It was amazingggggggggggg!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wish they had one in San Diego, but then I would be torn between my two favorite deli.There isn't really a seating area, they have random chairs and a window seating that fits about four average size adults. Always busy, can run out of stuff because it's so awesome and under demand. Anyone who is a tourist must try this deli. I know that most people don't look for a deli to eat when they travel, but this is a place that you have to go to. It'll probably satisfy your taste bud better than a $30 steak that could be a hit or miss depending on the cook and the service. Great food for any time of the day.
Wow, how good can a sandwich be? What's in those sandwiches that's got me having withdrawal symptoms?! Gosh darn it, it must've been the "Dirty Sauce."I ordered a Nacho Boy, and I loved it. I've only been to Ike's once because I was in the area and I yelped for local flavors in San Francisco. Damn, every time I hear of sandwiches, I immediately think of Ike's and I start to salivate (just kidding). The prices are pretty good for a delicious gourmet sandwich. I especially loved the hilarious names they've given to the sandwiches that are listed on the menu. The only thing I hate about this place is that parking is such a pain to find. San Francisco streets are so damn narrow. I was lucky enough to arrive around 10AM (there was already a line, of course), and found parking around the corner at the end of the street.Possibly the best sandwiches in California? It's definitely plausible.
Had Name of Girl I'm Dating combo. Pretty big sandwich, very filling. Chicken was so tender and bread is perfectly crisp and isn't soggy despite all the fixings of the sandwich. It gets super crowded so I recommend calling ahead and placing your order.
I've been craving Ikes ever since Adam showcased this on Man v. Food. He always visits the most awesomeness places. Their selection is vast like the Roman Empire or what is modern day Caesar's Palace in Vegas. I think you can't go wrong with any sandwich here, even if its just lettuce and tomatoes. And I got a little starstruck when I saw the owner.I'm not digging ordering outside and waiting though...and the wait was 30 mins and it wasn't even busy, only 2 people in front of me. I guess baking fresh bread takes that long. The rain killed my experience and me being sick, kind of ruined it. I thought it would be a bigger place, but it's definitely a hole in the wall which probably makes it that much better. 4.25 stars because the wait was forever long, but once you take a bite, it was definitely worth it.
Awesome sandwiches!To be perfectly honest, despite having an amazing meal from here complete with the free side of chips and pop, I was a bit disappointed. Though I suppose that's only because everyone who ever talked about it made eating Ike's seem like the experience was as if god jizzed in your mouth.Yes the sandwiches are delicious and much better than 99% of the other sandwich shops I've ever tried, and for a decently*-priced lunch it is totally worth my going back, but it seems like everyone should tone down the hype a bit.5 stars from this reviewer would have required something a bit better than just a huge variety of great sandwiches and to have a better queuing procedure - the wait is ridiculous!*I guess I should note that decent here means less than $20 for a meal; the sandwiches probably average about $10..
OMG! heart attack waiting to happen! =Ptoday was actually my 2nd time having a sandwich from Ike's, and it tasted as great as i remembered.although, i feel like im about to pass out, every bite of the sandwich was well worth it. =P Oh, and the wait today was about....1hr and so many minutes. after ordering, it took about another 15 minutes to receive. TIP: order in advance and pick up. that'll save you the 1hr+ wait!Today, I had the "hella fat bastard" + mozzeralla sticks & jalapeno poppers on dutch crunch. it was A-mazing! Sandwiches are super in size!! The bf and I shared, of course. EXTRA DIRTY SAUCE!! (special sauce that every sandwich consists of) mMm MMmm! love how it always comes out hot and fresh. Anything you ask for in a sandwich, you gottttt it, baby! Really unhealthy stuff, but tastes sooooo GOOOOD! ;)**sandwich comes with complimentary chips and caramel apple lollipop!definitely, not a sandwich i'd eat on a daily b/c i'd probably be on the chunkier side reaaaaal fast! but, if i were to take more friends up to frisco, i'd definitely want to take them to ike's to try!
I'm absolutely in love with Ike's. I moved out of the Bay Area almost two years ago and still fantasize about those sandwiches...The sandwiches are delicious. Absolutely. Each one has its own unique flavor and every time I try a new one, I feel like it's the best I've tasted (although, I think my favorite is the Eli Manning). They have quite an extensive menu so you can pretty much get anything to suit your mood. Added bonus: all of the sandwiches have fun and interesting names.A fair warning: be prepared to wait. Because it's such a popular place, there is always a line, not to mention the wait for them to actually make the sandwich. Expect to spend at least 20min or so. But no worries, the excellent staff makes the wait fun. They'll usually be someone hanging outside entertaining the crowd. (My favorite is random movie trivia--with prizes!) I often don't even realize that I've been waiting for my heavenly (yes, heavenly) sandwich.Icing on the cake: The staff is amazing. I've never seen such a fun group of people that seem to be genuinely happy to be at work and are having a good time. Their energy is contagious.
I just do not understand all the hype about this place. The sandwiches are nothing special.
Not thrilling me, but at least the sandwiches are big. I have been twice now and they haven't wowed me either time. The produce is fresh, but the combinations just don't see to work for me. Plus, they gog my order wrong during the last visit. I ate it anyway.
I'm not much of a sandwich person, but my boyfriend kept insisting that this would be the place that changed my mind.In short: it was. This is the. best. sandwich shop. EVER. I had the Menage a Trois, but found myself wishing I'd gotten the BF's Elvis Kieth. I've never had sandwiches whose flavors melded so well. The Dutch Crunch bread was outstanding and I wish I had the recipe so I could make it at home! Loved the chips selection and the candy apple lollipop they hide in the bag for later.We got there at 10 when it opened just because we happened to be in the neighborhood at the right time, so there was no line. Wish there was an area to eat in, but you really have to take the sandwiches to go.Overall, I can't say anything here that hasn't already been said by everyone else-- it's just the greatest sandwich made!
All of you out there PAY ATTENTION! ! ! ! If you want a Romantic European Experience visit the INCONTRO Restaurante at 455 Hartz in Danville. We were there tonight for a Birthday and also Celebrated our 50th in their Open Air seating Patio.August 2012. Both Dinners were Fabulous and the Service was Impeccable and European. The menu is VERY Italian and the Wines, Cocktails and Desserts were amazing. The Service was Professional and Warm. The Surrounding Romantic and the setting European. In the Bay area we can go many places to eat because we have the Best Choices but Many Live on Past Laurels, this one is living on the BEST TODAY. We are planning on the next occasion for next month. If you try this restaurant, sit out side and let Antonio serve you You'll be HOOKED! GO TRY and Prove me wrong as I'll pay your Tip if there a VALID GRIPE!
I mean, 5600 reviews, so what can I add that hasn't already been said... but after a Yelp hiatus I am working on my sammies list again, and no BA sandwich list could possibly be complete without Ike's.Ridiculously freaking good! Another vote for Menage a Trois - kind of converted my girl into a sandwich lover, ok maybe love is a strong word, but if I have a Menage I have to hide it from her or scarf it down real quick.Ike's has something for most any sandwich mood - just hop in, the water's fine!
I waited 1.5 hours in line for a sandwich and every bite was worth it. But of course next time, I'll be much smarter and put in a phone order. I was so jealous watching all those fools drive up, double park, and pick up their sandwiches in 1 minute.I ordered the Menage a Trois: Halal Chicken Breast, Real Honey, Honey Mustard, BBQ, PepperJack, Swiss, Smoked Gouda. You would THINK there would be too much cheese in this but it just adds to the already creaminess of this sandwich. The dirty sauce (garlic aioli with 19 spices) brings the sandwich to another level. I got this on Dutch Crunch and I'm normally unsure of this bread because some places can serve it rock hard with shards to rip up the rooftop of your mouth. But this... oh man... this was slightly crunch on the outside and soft on the inside.Ike's Place makes it just the way I like it... HOT AND SAUCEY!
TOP MUST EATS OF SAN FRANCISCO! I've always heard really great things about this place but didn't decide to go check it out until the news about it closing made headlines. Every time I drive by this place, the lines are always around the block but luckily my BF and I decided to order it by phone for pick up to avoid the wait. We went on a Monday afternoon around 530pm and there was no line. We had the Mnage a trios (Shredded chicken breast meat, "real" honey, honey mustard, BBQ sauce, Pepperjack, Swiss, and smoked Gouda cheeses with shredded lettuce, pepperocini, and tomato on Dutch Crunch).  It was SOOOOOOO GOOOD. The sauce was gushing out and every bite was heaven in your mouth. I do recommending you eat it right away. Do what you need to do...stand on the side of the street, run to your car, eat it while u walk... because with all that juice, the bread will get soggy pretty fast.
Yep. If you're looking for the best sandwich you've ever had in you're entire life. This is the place. If not, go to subway.
Mnage a trois on dutch crunch bread! This is my favorite and amazing.
Pros1) Their sandwiches are so good. I love their Veggie teriyaki.2) Prices are cheap considering the taste.Cons: 1) Parking can be tricky.Weird :1) Place and seating looks weird.2) Haven for hippies i guess ;)
Best sandwich in town, hands down!
What can I say that hasn't been said before? Ike's is delicious! Went here for my first time and had the Menage a Trois and their salt & vinegar chips. Perfection. Will definitely come back if I'm in the area!
Best sammich ever! Why would you consider anything else? Yum!!! I woulf persinally reccomend the tony roma or the super mario for meatball sub lovers.
Solid sandwiches. I don't know what else to say about it.
I don't think the sandwiches are that great to wait in line for 45 minutes. I'm also not a fan of their style of sandwich, which has a lot of sauce and mayonnaise. There's also no place to sit down and eat (I know it's called Ike's to go).
menage a trois on dutch crunch is yumm - the line gets ridiculously long, so order ahead by phone for faster pick up!
Best COMBO sandwiches I've had. Literally, everything you want they got!
Very good. Sometimes sloppy.
Ike's Place is ridiculously good. I can't wait to go back. Great atmosphere and the food is amazing.
Always such great sandwiches and I'm so happy it's no longer a 2 hour wait like it used to be. Great place to get a yummy sandwich, especially if you are planning on heading out to dolores for a picnic or just some r&r. The portions are huge now it seems - so for girls I definitely recommend sharing with a friend. Also - because they use sauce on their sandwiches, it's definitely better to eat your sandwich fresh/asap. Otherwise, it does get soggy rather quickly.
Featured on Man vs. Food!! I had to check out what all the hype was about! So many sandwiches to choose from , so many unique names, and so many drinks to try! What to choose? I highly recommend checking out their menu on their web site before going in. The shop was pretty small with a cash register stand placed in front of the door way. The chips stand was in front of the door way too and their menu is all over the place along the walls. Sodas are inside the shop in a fridge and sandwich making takes place within the rest of the shop. - Eli Manning ($8.98): Halal chicken breast, garlic/herb sauce, mushrooms, avocado, and cheddar. Flavorful, soft bread, loads of ingredients, and chicken was not dry (That's a plus!). My avocado was falling all over the place, but this sandwich was so delicious...or so I thought....until I had a taste of BF's Menage a Trois! - Menage a Trois ($8.98): Halal chicken breast, honey, honey mustard, bbq, pepperjack, swiss, and smoked gouda. Prior to this sandwich experience, I would think twice about putting honey in a savory sandwich. Now I know better. Favorite of the two sandwiches that I tried. Hint of sweetness with a wonderful mixture of all ingredients in each and every bite. So extraordinary that it is worth all that honey stickiness all over your hands. Portion size was generous and loaded with ingredients. How did I manage to eat two different halves of a sandwich? It was THAT good! Quite messy, but they do have a sink inside to wash your hands. Eat your sandwich while it's hot and fresh, because the parchment paper on each sandwich does get soggy and stick to your sandwich (The sandwiches are good, but I don't want to be eating paper with it, now!). I'll definitely come back to take a stab at another one of their cleverly named sandwiches, perhaps a "Do You Smell What Barack is Cooking?" =)Thank you Cece for your UYE and many thanks to Ike for accommodating us!
I don't know if you've heard but Ike's place is pretty famous in SF. Tons of hype, long lines, and oh so many sandwiches to choose from. Ike's lived up to every expectation I had. I ordered the Change sandwich (Rib Eye, beer battered onion rings, cheddar cheese and BBQ sauce) with tiger bread and it was probably the best sandwich I've ever had. I can't really describe why it was so awesome it just was. Everything just worked so well together. The ingredients were well cooked, the sauce was perfect, the bread was fresh and sweet. Ike's is definitely a must do if you're in SF (or where any of the other locations are).
Excellent variety of sandwiches! Good ingrediants and interesting combonations make this a go-to spot.
I LOVE THIS PLACE!I've been hearing about this place from a few friends so I decided to try it out during my trip to SF. The place is really small, it doesn't even have seating or anything. The cash register is at the front door and after you order, you go inside to pay and they give you a bag of chips on the house. They have really creative sandwich names and I ordered the Hollywood SF Cheesesteak. Amazing. Their dirty sauce (their own version of garlic aioli) definitely held up its reputation. I recommend anything with dirty sauce on dutch crunch bread (my favorite).I waited about an hour and half to actually get to the front of the line to order my sandwich and about another 30 mins to get my sandwich. It was definitely worth it.
Regular customer of the ugly owl (don't care for the recent name change) since it opened when I was in high school and was really shocked by the poor quality of the sandwich when I ordered it this past Sunday. I love IKE's and it might have been the sandwich preparer on this particular day, but seriously not edible. Dripping in teriyaki sauce, not in a good way, which made the bread soggy, the vegan breaded chicken soggy, and the whole sandwich incredibly salty. I could fill half a water bottle with the extra sauce left in the wrapper-not exaggerating! Couldn't even finish it. Nor could my brother- who would eat just about anything. I know you're popular now, IKE's, but please do quality checks.
It easy to make a sandwich. It's hard to make them as good as this place.
Fantastic sandwiches. Tried the "Matt Cain" with the works - amazing.
Really good sandwiches. We had the [Name of Girl I'm Dating] and really liked it. Lines can be a bit long, but definitely worth trying!
great sandwich!
omg. amazing.
Ike's Place is possibly the best sandwich shop in the city. Without a doubt, Ike's has the the title for most original sandwiches in the city by a longshot. With a wide range of options for almost all types of eaters, Ike's Place seems to have taken the art of sandwich-making to a new level. I just took a friend from LALAland to Ike's for lunch, as he wanted me to take him to a place that I would take my brother, who is a huge foodie. Ike's did not disappoint. As i did not eat breakfast, I thought that I would try two sandwiches, instead of my usual one. I got the Kryptonite (with mozzarella sticks and onion rings) and the Matt Cain. Both were fantastic, but I was was way out of my league for amount of food.The Matt Cain was amazing with the godfather sauce, provolone, lettuce, tomatoes, roast beef, turkey, salami on dutch crunch bread. It was toasted and did not last long in my hands (good sign).The Kryptonite is essentially 2 sandwiches, not just 1 more loaded down (dagwood-style) sandwich. Nevertheless, with a mixture of flavor that includes pesto, ham, avacado, and stuffed jalapeno poppers, every bite is like a completely different sandwich. All delicious. Plus I have excellent left overs. My friend got the The Damon Bruce, which I got a very tasty bite of. It had really good ribeye and steak sauce flavor Basically, every sandwich is amazing and chips are included.What separates them from other places, flavor wise, is the dirty sauce, dutch crunch bread, and Godfather sauce,Also, they have so many options and if you don't know what to get, the counter people are very helpful. The website is very helpful as well. Call-in option is an amazing advantage. Neutral: Drink options were decent, but not amazing. Potato Chips come with the sandwiches, but with four flavors, I would prefer the pretzel or corn tortilla chips. Con: Poor seating options (thank God for Dolores Park), expect to wait like 20 minutes for you sandwich.
for those of you who boast this is better then lil lucca's please try again.. they got I different style yes this is so, they got alot more toasted sanwiches this is also a plus but the wait for the sandwich is unbearable. parking is also very difficult to find in this areacame here with the wife today 12-28-09 lil after 1ish so we would not hit the large crowds there were about 5 people in front of us and maybe a handful of 9 if not 10 already waiting for their sandwiches to be made in total it took literally close to an hour and a half to get our 3 sandwiches that we ordered, we ordered the ex-boyfriend, the menage trios, and the sf philly cheesesteak Of all the 3 sandwiches we had the "menage trios" was the only sandwich that was on point, honey, honey mustard, yellow bell peppers, halal chicken, gouda cheese, and provolone I believe were the ingridents all meshed well and made a superb sandwich, bread had enuff crunch, bell peppers had enuff bite, the chicken moist and not dry the sauces in the sandwich all meshed well indeed a sandwich made for kings and paupers alike.the ex-boyfriend sandwich had a lil flair but nothing worth taking a third bite, the sf philly cheesesteak tasted more like a mushroom sandwich more then anything else, thin layer of rib eye hidden between all the layers of cheese and veggies, again this mite of been my fault for asking for everything on it but it is a one time deal either i like it with everything on it or i don't. This time around again I only approve the Menage trios sandwich out of the three we ordered mite of been because of that bbq sauce mixed with that honey and honey mustard.. but in a whole every sandwich you bite into should have that how do you say...that wanting to take another bite here it fell short..two small or massive bites at most of a sandwich and you know how they get down, you will know if you will be back or never come back.. for the wait, the parking, and choices of sandwiches I would come back but I will only order togo next time, 1 hour and 30 minutes literally to get your sandwich after you order it is not worth the wait, rather order over the phone and drive by in an hour to pick it up trust me it will be less of a hassle.food *** out of 3 sandwiches only one passes with flying colors (menage trios)price $$ minimum of 8 bucks easy if not more for the kryptonite it is $16.61 I think featured on man vs food ambiance ** from the outside you can tell it is a hole in the wall, never made it inside of the sandwich shop there was a gentlemen that was taking orders outsideservice *** dont get me wrong they are helpful very helpful and cheery but the wait after the order again is UNBEARABLEparking negative stars good luck finding parking went on a monday afternoon hour and a half after lunchtime still a huge wait time
Fate. I have Ike's bookmarked when they were at the other location. We found this awesome parking space near Church and were determined to walk around and enjoy ourselves. We had no clue where we wanted to go...when we were stopped by a red light, I noticed Ike's. What's more - there was no line! Hubby said it's meant to be - we had no clue Ike's was nearby. We studied the menu and decided on the Matt Cain - roast beef, turkey, salami, godfather sauce, provolone on dutch crunch with jalapeno pepper. For $9.99, you also get a bag of Dirty's chips - four choices. We got the jalapeno heat and a bottle of the Sioux City Sarsaparilla - $2.50. We waited and enjoyed the chips and soda - the Sarsaparilla was very good. While waiting, the line grew and grew and Ike was out and about talking to some people - we realized how lucky we were to beat the crowds! We decided to just enjoy our sandwich there since it was fresh and hot. It was juicy and delicious - the special sauce is the star here.
The Giant Sandwich is nemesis...being from baltimore. I had to try it and its amazing! The sauce is from heaven and the meet is tender! Grab and go at its finest although it took over 30 minutes to get a smmy. Its busy here.
Just went to this place today for lunch, and I ABSOLUTELY loved it!!They had SO many options and varieties, it was unbelievable!Before I go into how good it was, I'll start with some tips. -Plan on taking your sandwiches/burgers somewhere, such as a park, because there is no seating.-Chips are free and all are good options-Drinks are fun, because they come in bottles, such as root beer and cream soda bottles-Try something new if you go often! You'll like the food, no matter what you pick!Okay, so my friend and I got two different sandwiches, and both were delicious! Mine had fake chicken in it, which tasted great, but I didn't like the pickles in it (Tom Brady). My friend's was also good, including mushrooms and artichoke hearts.As you can see, ingredients are fun, and options are unlimited! For such a long line, service was efficient (menu being passed down line) and very friendly!! Must go if you have about an hour and half for lunch!!
great sandwich, great bread...good, efficient staff...good prices...worth the wait. would go back for sure...love it there...shame there's no seating/tables!
In terms of sandwiches, 5 stars. In terms of price, 3 stars for a mere sandwich!To be fair, I come from the land of $5 footlong Subway sandwiches and that is unfortunately where the bar has been set. At $10 for the [Name of Girl I'm Dating], the food has very much so met my expectations. When you consider the ingredients itself (chicken, honey mustard, avocado, and pepper jack) it doesn't seem like it would be a stellar sandwich... but somehow it is. It really can't be described... you just have to try it yourself! The only thing I can say is I've never had a sandwich that tasted like this! Don't forget, your sandwich comes with a bag of chips which include some crazy flavors to say the least (ie Cajun Dill Gator-Tators and Voodoo Gumbo chips)The store itself has nowhere to sit and eat... just some seating on the windowsill (?) where you wait for your food. But nearby Dolores Park makes up for it because I just stop by Bi-Rite market and picked up some organic strawberries, and then plopped down at Dolores Park for the perfect afternoon picnic. Would definitely come again and try their Manage a Trois amongst other sandwiches.
Ike's Place was the first spot my friends took me to immediately after checking into our hotel. To say that they couldn't wait to get a sandwich from here is a serious understatement; it was all they could talk about as soon as I saw them. Anyway, on to the rest of the review.FIRST IMPRESSIONS:Ike's is the sort of place you come to get a great sandwich and take it back home or to some other destination you have in mind. Unfortunately there is no seating at the restaurant (likely due to the incredible number of customers they churn through so quickly). Their menu at the restaurant looks simple enough with about 16 sandwiches and some other items to look at. But while waiting in line I discovered a immersive menu that can be filtered to your tastes of style, ingredients, vegan, and gluten-free meal options.THE EATS:My cashier recommended a modified version of the Mnage e Trois ssandwich that she called the "Yale Student" that adds bacon to an already stellar mix of halal chicken, honey, barbecue sauce, honey mustard, pepper jack, cheddar, and gruyere cheeses. And, at the recommendation of my vocal troupe of friends, I had the innards stuffed between two slices of Dutch Crunch bread. This sandwich was a mess: a delicious, saucy, bursting-with-flavor-but-not-overdoing-it mess. Be sure to snag some extra napkins and something to clean your hands with afterward, because the sweet barbecue sauce and honey will leave you wishing for a sink if one isn't near (like my experience). To put it simply, I devoured this sandwich, folks... And seeing the other sandwiches to come out of the magicians in the kitchen at Ike's, I can safely say that mine was merely one of a HUGE list of incredible options. -- Another neat point I should mention again is that they have Vegan and Gluten-free options and serve them with pride. If you're curious, quit debating and get over there to try one of these delectable creations.THE VERDICT:I probably don't need to say it at this point, but Ike's Place far exceeded what I believed to be wildly exaggerated expectations set by my friends. I'll be back for more, you can be certain of that!
awesome blossom
I know that this place does not need another review. But does this place DESERVE another 5 star review? YES.Yes, the wait is long. Yes, even calling ahead may require you to wait 2-3 hours for your sandwich. However, you really can't blame Ike's for the wait...I mean, if people are willing to put themselves through the pain of waiting time and time again, it's got to be pretty darn good, right?There are tons of things on the menu and making a decision on what to order is an ordeal in itself, but make sure that if the people at Ike's has a suggestion as to how to get your sandwich, LISTEN TO THEM. A prime example is the Home for Thanksgiving sandwich -- it comes with turkey, cheese, cranberry sauce, and Sriricha sauce with no veggies. The idea of Sriricha sauce turned me off at first, but now that sandwich can't be eaten without it. Case in point -- LISTEN TO THEM unless you're absolutely disgusted and/or allergic to a particular ingredient.I'm not going to tell you what else is good, because I honestly think anything is, as long as you like the ingredients. Make sure to get everything on Dutch Crunch -- it's flavorful and has great texture without being too crunchy/painful in your mouth.By the way, the menu varies slightly between the two locations in SF/Redwood City, so I suggest taking a look online based on where you decide to go.
I love Ike's. I really, really, really love Ike's. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.The first time I came to Ike's I was visiting San Francisco with my boyfriend and just randomly Yelping spots to eat. We naturally gravitated to Ike's because of ratings, number of reviews, and our love of sandwiches of course. We were totally shocked by how long the line was at 1PM and decided to just put in a phone order and come back later since the wait time was 1.5 hours. Ouch.I ended up ordering the Barry B with cheese sticks on Dutch Crunch bread while the boyfriend got the Menage A Trois. Needless to say, these sandwiches were mini-orgasms in our mouthes. I've yet to find a single fault with them.In fact, I love Ike's so much that I've taken it upon myself to force every one of my visitors to eat here with me. I've yet to fail in making them absolute fans.Since then, we've order the Kryptonite, Lex Luthor, Matt Cain, Pee Wee (vegetarian), The Change, and a few others. Each were equally good in their own right, but I'd have to say the winners were the Barry B, Kryptonite, and Matt Cain.I was pleasantly surprised by what an excellent job they do with Vegan/Vegetarian sandwiches. I ended up dragging my mother here who doesn't eat meat, eggs, or egg products of any sort on Saturday. We ended up hooking her up with the Vegetarian Pee Wee and she was amazingly happy. Considering my mom is pretty hardcore Indian and rarely likes American food, I was delighted for her!The only downer (besides the walk-in wait times) about Ike's sandwiches is leftovers. If you're like me and can't pack that entire sandwich in at one shot or ordered the Krypto by yourself, it doesn't taste that fantastic when saved and eaten later.Granted, they taste much better than the average sandwich but I think the magic of the bread and sauce just kind of disappear once it becomes soggy.As for the walk-in wait times, I don't really see as much of a downer. If you're craving, needing, or lusting after an Ike's sandwich just call in and order ahead. The wait is usually somewhere along the lines of 30-60 mins which gives me time to run errands before swinging by to pick it up. Definitely beats standing in line in my opinion.
It's all in the sauce. The perfect sandwiches. The bread is fresh, the chicken is tender and there are so many combinations of sandwiches that you will find your favorite easily. Best sauce I've had on a sandwich in years.
I stood in a deep ass line again to give Ike another chance, and I am not sold. Here are directions to the Best sandwich shop in the city from Ike's1.Head east on 16th St toward Dehon St2. Turn right onto Dolores St3. Continue onto San Jose Avenue4. Turn left toward San Juan Ave 5. Continue straight onto San Juan Ave6. Turn right onto Delano Ave7.

Ike's Place is one of the best sandwich joints in town. I now live two blocks away. What could be better? (for my taste buds... not so much for my waistline!)The way to get sandwiches here is to plan ahead and call your order in 30 minutes before you want to eat it. If you go without calling, you'll stand in line to place your order and then you'll wait to get it. The place is seriously that popular. (for a reason!)My favorites: the Menage a Trois (chicken, honey, honey mustard, bbq sauce, pepper jack, swiss, cheddar), the Going Home for Thanksgiving (turkey, cranberry sauce, sriracha, havarti... you really have to try this one!), and the We're JUST Friends (chicken, sweet orange sauce, avocado, pepper jack). The combinations seem completely off the wall sometimes but they're all delicious. Oh, and make sure to ask for extra Dirty Sauce!Every sandwich comes with a bag of chips (the good Dirty Chips kind, thick and crunchy) and they have a good selection of gourmet-ish sodas. Everything you need to pick up a lunch on the way to Dolores Park to spend a lazy weekend afternoon.Keep doin' what you're doin', Ike.
Husband and I love sandwiches and since husband saw this on some show, we absolutely had to stop. I can see why it was on the show. I had a King Koopa and the husband had something with Barack Obama in the name...can't remember. But, both sandwiches were awesome and delicious. The only sucky part is the parking...as is with any place in San Francisco coming from someone from Las Vegas.Love it.
Excellent sandwiches. Excellent opportunity to appear smooth as you bypass the entire long ass line by having ordered online or calling in first. Boom.
Ike's Place is the the place to go for sandwiches. How good can a sandwich possibly be, you ask? GO HERE NOW!!! I have never craved a sandwich before I tried one from Ike's Place - this place is amazing!There are a million different choices and combinations for you to choose from. They are super vegetarian and vegan friendly! The lines are generally long and they get pretty busy unless you go before or after the lunch hour rush, but it is well worth the wait. These sandwiches are REAL sandwiches, not flimsy little Subway poor-excuses-for-sandwiches. They are messy, as the best sandwiches should be. I've had the Vegan Tom Brady, the Sometimes I'm A Vegetarian, the Blind Date, the Wario and the Love Triangle and they are all excellent. It's impossible not to find something you like here.
Ike's Place makes the best sandwiches I have ever had by far. Almost everything on the menu is good, it just depends on the meat and condiments that you are craving that day. What's so special about their sandwiches is their DIRTY SAUCE. It is a spread made up of sixteen different spices and it is baked into their bread. The Dirty Sauce MAKES the sandwiches what they are and there is nothing else in the world that comes even close. My personal favorite is the Eli Manning on dutch crunch bread.If you are ever in San Francisco, do your pallet a favor and stop by Ike's Place. The lines can get pretty long during lunch and dinner hours and the wait after your order is roughly 20 minutes, so I recommend calling in to place and order instead. There is also very limited seating so plan accordingly on a place to dine. Most people like to take the sandwiches and enjoy them at nearby Deloris Park.For those of you who have been to Ike's Place before, there are also sandwiches that aren't on the Menu so you might want to do a little bit of research before going back so you can order something fresh and new that you haven't had ;) Ike's Place never gets old.
Their vegetarian sandwich called the "Ugly Owl" is the best sandwich I've ever eaten.Expert tip: You can ask for a super secret special spicy version of it.
I don't think there's anything else I can say that hasn't been said, but still needed to thrown down a review and add to the 5 star reviews.The boy and I went on a Sunday ~3pm. We woke up late and were in the mood for some good grub to make up for the breakfast we missed and lunch. Figured we'd head over to Ike's and try it out .. suck it up and deal with the long lines.. and boy are we glad that WE DID. As noobs we waited in line instead of calling in - 45 minutes is a good estimate of how long it takes to wait, order, and then wait for the food...but it's worth the wait!!We tried 3 sandwiches between the two of us. I LOVED my "change" with the steak, beer battered onion rings, bbq sauce and whatever else goodness they put in there. The sandwich is just perfectly done and after driving back home to chow down they were still warm and toasty... DAMN IT I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. The boy loved his meatball sandwich .... "king koopa" , meh.TRY IT.
I don't want to rate this place too high even though I crave it often and the servers are really nice. I love it but the lines are long enough. Don't come here.
Make sure the line outside doesn't block the sidewalk ^^Probably one of the best places to get a sandwhich, travelled from Berkeley to SF just for this sandwhich. So many sandwhiches that it'll take me awhile to try them all!Parking in this area can be a hassle but there should be done down the street.
It's only a matter of time before Ike's stands shoulder-to-shoulder in the genericized trademark club with the likes of Kleenex (tissue), Q-tips (cotton swabs), and other brands that are so known for making their staple product, that the line between brand and product completely blurs. Soon, people will no longer refer to sandwiches as "sandwiches," they'll refer to them "Ike's." Well, maybe I'm going a bit overboard here, but they're truly spectacular... I've been frequenting the SF location for three or four years, and I've had the absolute pleasure of trying quite a few offerings from their menu. The dutch crunch bread alone is almost worth the price of admission, and would completely steal the show in most cases -- keyword: most. The way it pairs with their equally magnificent dirty sauce is something in the realm of magic. It's like eating a sandwich made with best garlic bread you've ever had, the most decadent ingredients imaginable, and enjoying those ingredients in the context of the most creative combinations imaginable. Some personal favorites of mine are their flagship sandwich, the "Menage A Trois," the tender steak concoction they call "Change," and a newer sandwich by the name of "Jaymee Sirewich." Truth be told, I don't think you could go wrong here if you tried. Every sandwich I've sampled from the menu has its own unique identity, but doesn't stray too far away from unique flavor that dominates all of their creations. This is the place that put sandwiches on the map for me.
Love, Love, Love! Ike's is absolutely FANTASTIC!! If you feel like a fresh, juicy, huge sandwich that lights up your taste buds and keeps you wanting more and more-- Ike's is your place. When you walk in, you have to immediately grab a menu (If you haven't previously made up your mind by looking at their menu online), because no matter how much you are salivating, it's going to be very difficult to make up your mind. With sandwiches like "Nacho Boy," "We're JUST Friends," and "Vegan Gramps," there are so many delicious combinations to look at and decide upon. I've had the We're JUST Friends numerous times and it is super yummy. I love the sweet orange glaze over the chicken with the avocado-- it's not even 7 in the morning and I want one!Also, the SF location is super laid back, everyone is really friendly even when it is really busy, which is quite often. However, the line goes usually pretty quickly and you get free chips. I know the location in Redwood City (Ike's Lair) doesn't extend that offer. Also, if you are rushing but still want to have some Ike's yummy goodness, no problem, just call before they close and you can pick up your sandwich up to an hour later. I would recommend you pick a sunny, awesome SF day and walk to the Castro, pick up a delicious sandwich (I don't think you could really go wrong with any of them, but I would go with the We're JUST Friends), and walk to Dolores Park and eat it while overlooking the city of SF. Sounds like a perfect day with Ike's to me.
SO BOMB!!!!!! Prices are kind of crazy for sandwiches, but definitely worth it!!!!!! We love going here when we're in the city. These sandwiches make me happy :)
I LOVE IKE'S! My fave sandwich place in the city! Yes, believe the hype and it's definitely worth the wait!I've tried 18 different sandwiches so far and I've enjoyed them all, but my top 5 have to be: 1) Damn Straight, 2) Name of Girl I'm Dating, 3) Backstabber, 4) Jim Rome, and 5) Stupid Eggplant Sandwich. I've always called ahead since waiting in line and then waiting for your food can take as long as an hour or more and the most I've had to wait for a phone order was 2.5 hours.Ike and everyone there are all really nice. Shoutout to Chase! :D
Little Lucca's is far better.
I'm not a sandwich person, especially since the vegetarian options are usually the same across the board. I hate eggplant, bell peppers, and firmly believe avocado should not be the main "protein" in a sandwich.The vegetarian/vegan options are amazing! I tried their "Meatless Mike" with gluten free bread, and it was the best sandwich I've ever had. Service was friendly, but don't come here if you're in a rush-- my wait in line was considered "short" and it was about 15 minutes just to place my order, and maybe another 15 to receive my sandwich... but its totally worth the wait!Before throwing away your bag, peek around the wad of napkins... I found a lollipop! What a wonderful surprise x3
Good sandwiches perfect for picnic! It even comes with a bag of chips and a apple caramel lollipop! The guy recommended the voodoo chips and it was so good! The sandwich was a good size so that my friend and I (2 girls) were able to share. I like the bread and enjoyed the flavors from the mnage trois sandwich I got.
This place rules!!!!
Food = OK.Service = Great.Me and my girl went around 1 on a Saturday. There was about a 15-minute line, and right when we hopped in, one of the workers came out and gave us some free sandwich samples and thanked us for waiting. He gave us chocolate, too. The place was full of bros for some reason, so the vibe was kind of collegey. Once we ordered (I got the Lincecum and she got the Jaymee Sirewich), it took about 20 minutes to get the goods. While we waited, we popped open our sodas, of which Ike's has a great selection.Overall, the food is alright but the atmosphere and the service is great. I'd at least try it once.
The best sandwiches ever!! I always get the Bill Walsh/Barry Zito, but you cannot go wrong with any of them!
Can't believe that I've never written a review for Ike's yet. But what is is new to say that hasn't said by thousands of yelpers already? This place is absolutely delicious and filling. Sandwiches are messy, but who doesn't love to get down and dirty for good food? Hearing the name Ike's is making my mouth water. I can't wait till they open one at SFSU location, a much easier access location ;)
When my friend came up from LA to visit, he kept talking about some joint in SF w/ "the best sandwiches in the bay area." Naturally, I didn't believe him; such accolades get tossed around all the time and all I end up with is an overpriced, pretentious sandwich that doesn't even have the lively touch of MSG to make it memorable. When I got to the Castro, the sandwich line was spilling out over the sidewalk. I wasn't excited. (esp. as the sandwich prices start at a whopping $9 and go up from there) But I played along, waited the requisite 45 minutes, and ordered my MILF ($11.11) The cashier was v. personable & delightful to talk to, (perhaps a reason why the wait is so long) and the sandwiches came w/ a bag of kettle chips & a caramel apple lollipop. Such freebies aren't perks when they're thrown in with already overpriced sandwiches, but these sandwiches are like, out of the normal-sandwich league. Ike's sandwiches are amazing.My friends and I drove to Dolores Park and had our sandwiches overlooking the city. There were a few long minutes of silence as we did nothing but shovel sandwich into our mouths. We tried each others' sandwiches. We gave our sandwiches Academy Awards (as in, which award would each win if it was a movie?) So here they are:Nacho Boy (Best Actor)Milf (Best Original Screenplay)Super Mario (Best Director)Fat Bastard (Best Picture)Ugly Owl (Best Adapted Screenplay)These sandwiches are bomb. You can take them home and eat them a day or two later (as I did), and they're still bomb. They eat like a mess of great ingredients all lovingly piled and smashed together, pressed down panini-like for your convenience. The bread is fresh and hefty enough to withstand the panoply of spicy meat (ref. to the MILF) and melted cheese and crunchy veggies. The wait: I'm not sure if the sandwich is worth the wait (at least past the first-time experience.) But I've heard you can order in, so I'd really suggest trying that. Bottom Line: "That's a pretty f*cking good sandwich. I don't know if it's worth ten dollars but it's pretty f*cking good." (And it is worth it.)
DUDEEEE. Tried this place for the first time this weekend and am definitely coming back.Things I like:- their friendly staff (I phoned in to see how long a phone order would take and they were super nice on the phone as well). Patient, smiling, and helpful despite lots of peeps and loud noise levels.- their menu. It's HUGE.- their prices. Considering the size of the sandwich you get and the fact that each comes with a bag of chips, it's legit.- the Tim Lincecum. Granted, it's the only sandwich I've tried. But it was satisfying in a way I can't even describe. Turkey, ham, bacon, havarti, avocado, and dirty sauce on dutch crunch. Yeah, I'll let you wipe up your drool now.Things I don't like:- Their line set-up. It's slightly awkward and the line runs straight in front of the bathroom door.- The fact that some people who order after you get their sandwiches before you.- Yeah, that's about it.They take credit cards. They're located near Dolores Park so you can get your sando to-go and eat it there while you watch dogs (or in the case of my friend, go chase dogs).Holding off one star for now until I sample more things on their menu.
#9 on Dutch loaded and dirty was great but call in order to save time waiting in line. The sandwich is good, really good but not worth the time it takes to get it. Prepare yourself with a friend or a book as it could take hours to make it through the street side line for your hogie of love.Great neighborhood, friend and personal service and a good sammy make Ike's a must and without he wait, 5+ stars.
i went there with my family, we ordered five sandwiches, mom got the nacho boy, dad got the matt cain, i think my cousin got the spiffy tiffy, bro got the menage a trois, and i got the 1050 don't remember the namewhen we sat down, i bit into my 1050 and was largely disappointed. it was nothing like what i imagined but i guess that's my fault... anyways i went on to try the menage a trois and it was pretty amazing... my brother and i swapped half half.  i don't think i liked the spiffy tiffy and the only other sandwich i liked was the nacho boy. prices are a bit on the expensive side and you look at the sandwich and think that it won't fill you up... but believe me, it does. each sandwich comes with a bag of chips... but this place already has about 5000 reviews so i don't know why i'm writing one... liked 2/5 of the sandwiches i tried. so eh. the people there were super nice though.
Came here for the very first time tonight!! My BFF loves, loves this place and she had always talks about this place. My friend and I decided to finally try this place out tonight...it did not disappoint.I ordered the Eli Manning #100 and my friend ordered The Name of the Girl that I Dated # 9. Both on Dutch Crunch bread. My Eli was awesome, but messy...a good kind of messy!  My friend said his sandwich was good as well - alittle sweet as there was honey mustard in it.We got the drink and chips which made this a yummy sandwich experience. I wished I discovered Ike's sooner! It is a bit pricey for a sandwich, but well worth it!
I always love this place! Eat it FRESH! The chips are great too. The workers there are awesome, we came around closing time and they let us chill there way past the closing time. There was also barely any wait. I remember last time there was a HUGE line.. It was still worth it! A must have when you're in SF!
Such a great sandwich. The first time I went I thought I could get a similar quality sandwich cheaper elsewhere, but now I know better. The "Not Tonight I Have a Headache" sandwich is awesome. Top it off with jalapeo chips, a rare Orange 'n Cream soda, and a surprise caramel apple pop for dessert and I am sold!Almost minus 1 star because you can't leave there for less than $10, but it's worth the money
October 24, 2009 @ 6PMI am not a sammie kinda girl. I'm usually disappointed whenever a business-sponsored lunch served sandwiches only.Until BF and I saw Ike's Place on MAN VS. FOOD. youtube.com/watch?v=Y1cGAnd it became a regular topic of our conversations. Until we found ourselves slowly obsessing over the the KRYTONITE.And this beautiful afternoon around 6 pm BF who's sickie in his sweatpants and I crossed the Bay Bridge to have our Saturday Day Night Date at Ike's Place.And we placed our orders: BF: KRYTONITE: yelp.com/biz_photos/dold yelp.com/biz_photos/dold 13 ingredients:1) 5 slices of pepperjack cheese, 2) roast beef, 3) turkey, 4) pepperoni, 5) ham, 6) corned beef, 7)bacon, 8) 2 avocados, 9) ONION RINGS, 10) MOZARELLA STICKS, and 11) JALAPENO POPPERS! Bread doused in a top secret DIRTY SAUCE of garlic infused mayo then baked.  TOTAL WEIGHT= 4 LBS!ME: TRINITY: Vegetarian Bacon, avocado and jalapeno poppers on dutch cruch with all the works   yelp.com/biz_photos/doldWe drove back home while BF was cradling his Kryptonite like our newly born love child.  And finally---both the Kryptonite and Trinity were worth obssessing over. Crunchy and creamy, messy, fun, delicious, tasty and with different textures in our mouths. The Kryptonite is the sammie's version of the "Kitchen Sink" but a very delicious flavorful kitchen sink!And for a girl who does like not sammies, this girl finished her Trinity along with 4 bites of the Kryptonite. I won't say vegetarian bacon can compete with real bacon but I was very happy with mine. Total: $30.51 including tax and Pioneer Soda before tip.Ike himself told us that the record for finishing the Kryptonite was 6 minutes and 30 seconds. (BF finished his in 15 minutes.) BTW, Ike is a very nice guy. I felt like I just met a celebrity. It won't be our last, Ike! ;pMOVIES AT HOME: Watched Man vs. Food in SF after we ate our sammies. (Yeah, we're dorks! LOL!) And "Land of the Lost" on DVD (super-corny but made me LMAO!)JUST A NOTE: Krytonite is not on the menu. You have to ask. Just mention "Man vs. Food."
Finally crossed Ike's off my food bucket list! Everyone always talked about it so I thought it wouldn't be as great after all the hype, but it definitely lived up to my expectations. I went with my friend and her dad so we ordered 3 sandwiches to share: the Damon Bruce, Paul Reubens, and Going Home for Thanksgiving. As an avid beef lover, the Damon Bruce was like taking a bite into heaven. It was so flavorful and the beef was so tender. I was afraid that when I bit into the onion rings, the onion would slide out completely, but it was cooked well enough that each bite of onion ring had a piece of onion in it. The Paul Reubens was another incredible sandwich. I'd had the reuben at another sandwich shop which was good but a little on the salty side, but this one was excellent. I especially loved the coleslaw in the sandwich, which kept the pastrami from tasting too salty. Definitely get it on the Dutch Crunch loaf.I had my doubts about Going Home for Thanksgiving, mainly because I'd never heard of anyone pairing sriracha, or anything spicy, with turkey, and putting cranberries in a sandwich also seemed a little bizarre. However, the spiciness and tartness balanced each other out nicely, and the sriracha wasn't so overpowering that I could still taste the turkey and cranberry combination, just like Thanksgiving.Each of our sandwiches were about $10, which seems pricey but is well worth it because they're so big. The order also comes with a bag of chips and a caramel apple lollipop! I hear the line is insanely long on weekends, but there was hardly any wait when we went around 12 on a weekday. There's also nowhere to sit down and eat in the shop, but Dolores Park is just a couple blocks away, which makes for a nice picnic, and Bi-Rite Creamery is great for dessert! I'll have to come back again before I leave for college!
Matt Cain...enough said!
Someone's gotta have a dissenting opinion every now and then. This time it's me. We ordered a couple of sandwiches to take to the Giants game, which isn't that far away. Why do they wrap these in plain brown paper, rather than some sort of lined paper like many places (or a butcher shop) might use? Both sandwiches had soaked completely through the paper, the napkins in the bag, and almost the bag itself. Seems like such a simple fix...almost every order is eaten off the premises.Even after the we picked all the paper bits out of them, the sandwiches (Menage & Jaymee) were kinda blah. At 2 for $25, totally not worth it.
Weird but awesome ingredients combination, they are all full of flavor and all I can think about is yummy day at the Dolores park with my Ike's sandwich!
I don't say this very often about places in general, let alone a sandwich shop, but I love Ike's Place. I had already heard about this place by word of mouth, but seeing it on Man vs. Food made me want to try this place even more. Typically, places featured on shows have a lot of hype, but this place is the real deal. We decided to come here on a Saturday afternoon, but we were unsure to call in our order or not since this place is notorious for its long lines. Calling in around noon meant a pickup time at 2:30 pm. We were told that it would be much faster to go there and wait in line, which we did. The line actually moves pretty fast and we got our order within 15-20 minutes. After pondering the sandwich choices and looking over the menu for two days, I finally settled on the Menage a Trois. You can't go wrong with halal chicken, real honey, honey mustard, BBQ, with three different types of cheeses. I have also concluded that this place makes the best dutch crunch bread that I've ever had. Do yourself a favor and eat the sandwich fresh here. Taking it to go or pickup will only leave you disappointed by the fact that you took a pass on sandwich perfection. I opted for a sandwich with flavor over quantity of meat and I was very satisfied. The flavors were bold, yet not overwhelming. I don't think you can go wrong with real honey in a sandwich. It sounds unorthodox, but trust me, it's good. Dare I say that this was the best sandwich I've ever had? Quite possibly so.It's also cool that you can actually see Ike working at the shop and chatting it up with his customers. He's genuinely a cool owner and really puts customer service high up on his priority list. He also reminds me of Howie Mandel. I can't wait to come back to try some of the other sandwiches. Can I conquer the Doomsday?
My favorite outdoor dining spot in the Sierras!!
Great sandwiches to take to the nearby park. Plenty of delicious veggie options.
The bread alone is reason enough to come here. We were looking for a great sandwich place on our recent trip to SF and I am so glad we found Ike's. We enjoyed a wonderful morning at Golden Gate Park (not far away) and this was the perfect lunch!! I had the Barry B, and will be thinking about it for a long time.
Hot momma Huda. Oh my goodness how delicious it is. Probably my favorite sandwich joint. There is usually a long line so be prepared to wait but it's well worth it.
The sandwiches are great and whatever you want they can make. The creative named sandwiches are the best so make sure you study!Downside to this place is the hype and the overpriced sandwiches. I can get a little lucas sandwich in the 650 for half the price and twice the sandwich.
Spoiler Alert: If you have a proactive bone in your body, just call ahead and avoid the lines. So worth any wait for the Elvis Keith...droooool.
The line moved so quickly even on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. The lady at the counter was delightfully upbeat despite the long lines and our sandwich was delivered hot with individually wrapped halves (because they knew we were sharing!). I'm such a fan of their sandwiches, although they can be on the saucy side, sometimes it's what you're in the mood for, ya know?They have a great eclectic chip and drink selection, so choose wisely and always get the dutch crunch bread :)
Get Mozzarella sticks + the Jamie (fried chicken sandwich) and watch as your heart clogs in pain but your stomach moans in ecstasy.
These sandwiches are pretty darn good! I had a hard time deciding between sandwiches because they all had quirky names and they all sounded tasty. Ended up getting the Spiffy Tiffy because avocado, mushrooms, and cheese are the basic foundation for any good sandwich. The halal chicken was good with that dirty sauce and the dutch crunch perfectly crunchy and chewy. I want to go back and try them all!
Great sandwiches. Creative options. Very popular, even when you call ahead, be prepared to wait!
I thought it was okay.Everyone else with us thought it was really good but I thought it was just a bit better than Subway (which I am not impressed by at all)
Place very easy to find,nice area,very delicious sandwich!its too big for woman I think,but still so yummy!
My daughter took me here after her vegan friend took her to Ike's! OMG! I salivate thinking about the sandwiches here. I had the Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian ( I'm always a vegetarian) with grilled mushrooms, marinated artichoke hears, pesto and provolone on a Dutch crunch roll! So delicious and the rolls are so fresh! My daughter had the Spiffy Tiffy and although I didn't taste it, being a vegetarian, it looked fantastic; chicken, mushrooms, avocado, pesto, provolone and pepper jack on a Dutch crunch roll! BTW, we only ate half our sandwiches because we were so full! Great vegetarian and vegan selections as well as meat sandwiches! Nice!Definitely recommend Ike's!
I'm a big believer in second chances. So, Ike's Place will get one from me given my first time there didn't live up to the hype. I honestly tried. My mind tried convincing myself that what I ordered was one of the best concoctions I had ever seen wrapped in parchment paper. I went with the Dutch Crunch Bread... I ordered a classic 13 dollar sandwich the super bubbly and friendly cashier recommended but in the end the flavor wasn't there. TOO MUCH SAUCE. That in itself is hard for me to say. How can you have too much sauce? Well when the clock is slowly counting down in your head as you notice your bread quickly turning to mush, that is when you have to much sauce. You have too much sauce when all you taste is the sauce. You can't taste the meat, you can't taste the cheese. And trust me, the sauce wasn't that phenomenal where that is all you would want to taste. All in all, just ok. But like I said I will give it another shot. For the sandwich I feel I'm paying a bigger price for the fame behind the joint but hey there is a buzz about it. People walking in are typically loyal locals or visitors anxiously trying to figure out what to decide on. We shall see each other again Ike's. I hope you impress me more next time.
I have a great idea. Let's put a 24 hour fitness right next to Ike's Place. Not just next to Ike's Place but give it enough room so the people on their treadmills can see the sheer joy on the faces of the patrons leaving the shop with hot meat, fresh bread, and sauce blowing their minds. You can see a slow progression going through most peoples faces as they try to wrap their hands (and their minds) around what could be the holy grail of sandwiches.I myself had only heard of this infamous "Ike's" and about how Ike himself was up at the front lines, chatting it up with customers and running the show like a pro. I never have enough time in the day to do much more than get up and go to work so fortunately, one of his creations was brought to me. And oh my goodness did it deliver. Maybe I had the quintessential mother of all creations that Ike is famous for or maybe my friend was pulling my leg when he said the 7'' football of a sandwich was only half of something called "Doomsday." Whatever the case may be, I think my stomach met it's match that fateful day.I can't describe the sheer gluttony I was experiencing while trying to wolf down this masterpiece. I think I counted about 7 layers of some finely sliced, equally flavorful meat which not only delivered on taste, moistness, and cut but held it's own against the cous de gras of my poor stomach-the mozzarella sticks and jalapeno poppers. You read that right people-there's mozzarella sticks and jalapeno poppers ON THE SANDWICH. My poor stomach was torn between ecstasy and a first time case of indigestion. And yet I still kept mowing my way down because eating an Ike's sandwich is my idea of crack cocaine. It does wrong things things to you but the next day you've just gotta have another.
I have a Love/Hate relationship with this place.LOVE - their sandwiches, tried the Nacho Girl & Shawn Michaels + avocado SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO DELICIOUS! Who thinks of putting mozarella sticks in their sandwich?!?!?HATE - their lines (i know these people are working hard, but 15 minutes in line + 15 minutes waiting for your sandwich to be made = extra 30 minutes before you get hungry!)HATE x2 - I also came on a Sunday and tried to call in for an order BUT they wouldnt take my phone order, so I had to come down to the area, park, wait in line, wait for the sandwiches =[ sadness.
First time:) So delicious!!!! Love spiffy tiffy. Go for the MILF if yo like things spicccccay. We ordered sandwhichs and ate a local nearby park in the sunny weather. Recommend anyone in the area to try!
I don't normally like sandwiches-- but Ike's is the exception. The sandwiches are amazing. I've had the Elvis Keith, Spiffy Tiffy, and Matt Cain-- and I think they are all delicious. I love the sauce and of course, the dutch crunch. Like others, I wish they did have seating. Other than that, the wait and the inability to sit is worth it. I haven't been back in a while-- but I think it's due time. Ike's is definitely the place to go for sandwiches in San Francisco. Heck, it is the place to go in California. One suggestion: sandwiches with fries in them!
Long line, quirky sandwich mixes and gratuitous shows of cleavage? What's not to love about the famous line (err...I mean sandwiches) at Ike's Place? Yes, we enjoyed the story about the 19th place finish in the hunky Jesus competition 2-years ago, Brad F.!! Oh yeah, the sandwich was pretty good, too. But mostly, the line was the most fun. Much better than waiting in line at Tartine.
What can I say? When it come to taste, Ike's place delivers. Had the menage a trois with the halal Chicken. Yummy in my tummy! Want a sandwich but also want a little extra. Try Ike's....the only negative is its a little pricey so I can't eat it everyday ,)
Very pleased that there were so many gluten free options! I just got a plain old tuna melt, but it was yummy. Sandwhich, chips and a drink was all under $10! Super good value.
Everyone knows what's up here - high quality high calorie ingredients on delicious bread. It's a bit pricey, but it's certainly a case of you get what you pay for. I only wish I had time to sit down and eat there, but I had to catch a flight and ate it at the airport. Still great.I'm hungry again.
Honestly not as epic as I expected from all the fuss, but a good, solid sandwich. I loved the dutch crunch and I got the vegetarian meatbal which was pretty great.
One of the Best Sandwich experiences in the East Bay!
Everyone would tell me these were the best sandwiches ever. I used to walk by and scowl in disbelief mainly because of the crazy line.Lo and behold I've finally made it and must say Ike's passes the test.So yeah it's legit. Ike's is an intensely delicious sandwich with a variety of options. It's a good size and with plenty of flavor. The Nacho Boy on wheat is one great meal, one that stands up to the post-gym-hunger challenge. The question still remains; are these the best?In my opinion the answer is no but Ike's is definitely in the discussion. It is somewhat the legend everyone has buit it to be and makes me want to literally "Try 'em all!".
I hate long lines unless the place is an absolute must. And I must say, this will be a place that is. We waited about 40 minutes, and the line never died behind us. All their sandwiches have catchy names, and they do have a pretty long list of choices. We went with the Menage a Trois with stuffed jalapeno poppers and the Barry Z. The Barry Z was good, but I wouldn't say that I would order it again, only because there are so many other choices. BUT! I felt so guilty enjoying the Menage a Trois. I absolutely love my go to sandwich place, Genova's, but the threesome tastes sooo good, even though it is so bad for you. Can't wait to try the other 100+ choices.
I told you Shatangi loves sandwiches!! I'm going wicked far out of my way for one of the best sandwiches ever tonight.Last time I could not have ben more impressed with the deliciousness of my meal and the way they had it ready for me when I got there even though the place was packed at closing.Extra star for the iPhone app!!Shatangi told you...
The servers there were do friendly! They helped you out so much and they are always happy and excited. I become postive when I enter the restraunt
Wow! Ike's! Yum! Best sandwiches in SF Bay Area. Bring your friends and your apetite. These sandwiches are HUGE ... and TASTY.
Best Friend- "Dude were in San Francisco and you want a sandwich?"Me- "Man this place has amazing reviews on..."BF- "Let me guess, on Yelp? It better be great, I could eat a sandwich at home"Me- "Yelp rarely lets me down"BF- "I will be the judge of that"When you think of a sandwich you think of a lighter, healthier meal (like Subway).Well if you're looking for that type of sandwich then Ike's Place is not the place for you. Technically you could get a healthy sandwich from Ike's but with crazy and delicious toppings like jalapeo poppers, beer battered onion rings, and mozzarella sticks what could possibly make a person want to order a light and healthy sub. The sandwich I ordered was called the Jeries' BIG Meat Sandwich. This bad boy was made on DutchCrunch bread (which was amazing) and was covered with their famous dirty sauce (they bake the sauce into the bread before they put the toppings on it). This sandwich had tons of roast beef, pastrami, turkey, ham, salami, and jack cheese stacked in it. And of course I added a bunch of yummy toppings like provolone and Swiss cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, jalapeos, pickles, grilled onions, mozzarella sticks, pesto sauce, avocado slices, and bacon.This was defiantly not a sandwich that Jared from Subway would be caught dead with. It was huge, delicious, and very filling. My sandwich, a bag of chips, and bottle of Orange crush coast me about 15 dollars or so which is not bad considering how many extras I added to the sandwich. The service here was also really fast, it only took them about 10 minuets to make my sandwich from scratch and bring it to my table. This place is must if you're visiting the Bay Area. Just make sure you are hungry and patient (the line for a sandwich can get long). PS- My friend got a Super Mario which is a sandwich made with all beef meatballs, mozzarella sticks, mozzarella cheese, and marinara sauce on DutchCrunch bread.He loved it. Yelp -1 BF- 0
I had my first Menage a Trois last month. It was the most amazing experience I've ever had.......in sandwich form!! Who knew a BBQ chicken sandwich could be so damn delicious?? My second Ike's experience was Mayoose's CA-BLT. From five basic ingredients, cheese, avocado, bacon, lettuce and tomato, came THE BEST BLT EVERRRRR. No shit. I'm totally serious when I tell you that eating this sandwich was life-changing. Ike ruined it for all other BLTs in the world. The sheer number of different sandwiches Ike's Place offers is mind-boggling. It is so difficult deciding on which one to order. The last time I had Ike's, I studied the menu all morning and narrowed it down to four. By lunchtime I had finally made a decision. Aside from using high-quality ingredients, Ike's sandwiches have something other sandwiches don't: Dirty Sauce. I don't know what's in it, and I don't care. It's sooo tasty and adds an extra depth of flavor. If you haven't tried Ike's and are a sandwich aficionado, you MUST go there! Today.
Tips for pick-up ordering: call around 10 am to have your choice of pick-up times, otherwise you are stuck in phone order queue which could get you a pick-up time of two hours later. We called at 1pm and were told 2:55pm, faster to just wait in the line.These people are so freakin' nice! I actually don't mind waiting in line for 30 minutes to order, and then an extra 15 to get my sammich. They are always so cheerful, how could anyone get mad at those sweet faces? Today I arrived a little before 1pm. Waited around with some hip youngsters, got some tips on cramming for my midterms, which pills to pop and whatnot. And today I went all the way...with the Nacho Boy SUPREME. Deliciousness. Woulda been better (for me) with turkey.
I ordered online and they took forever! Apparently, they had forgotten my order so they tried to give me free chips with my sandwich, so I guess they made up for it. Besides their shitty online system, I love this place! It's delicious!
Like the other Ike's locations I've been to (Stanford, Cupertino, Santa Clara), this spot is consistently great. Unlike the other three locations, I love that they include a bag of chips with your order. The jalapeno is my favorite. The sandwiches are amazing, of course (albeit pricey). Friendly staff. Place was a little hard to find last time I went there, but maybe that's because I walked all the way from Hayes Valley and didn't know they had moved until I stopped by the library to ask if I was going the right way. One thing that I thought was odd was the bathroom being located directly next to the line. You could totally hit a fellow unsuspecting patron with the door if you're not careful. The bathroom could be a little cleaner, too. But the most important part is the sandwiches and they rarely disappoint!
Partial Halal Menu as stated on the menu and verbal assurance from Owner/Staff. This is one of the original locations of Ike's Place. Most of the Chicken Sandwiches are Halal. But be careful of those sandwiches which mix Halal Meat and Non-Halal such Bacon, Salami, etc. Try the "49er", "Hot Momma Huda" and the "Will the Thrill" sandwiches. Great Stuff and Very friendly staff. They even give you a cool lollipop with your sandwich:)! Note sandwiches are a little on the high side, but most of the time comes with a bag of chips, so worth the $10 price!
Spiffy Tifffy, nuff said
Unique and delicious sandwich.
I love Ike's. My favorites are the Elvis Kieth and We're Just Friends. The only thing is they could be faster and more efficient in ringing customers up. It takes forever to get in and out of there even when its not busy (which is rare)
I recently read in the Marin Independent Journal that Ike's would be losing its lease on 16th Street by the end of the month due to neighbor complaints. And I didn't want the doors to close without trying the sandwich shop that everyone Yelps about, so I headed down to 16th to try one of their signature subs. Parking wasn't much of an issue, as I parked only a block away from the sandwich shop.As I approached the shop, there were several patrons waiting in line to order, while my eyes glazed at their window menu. A polite employee asked if I'd like to see the full menu and I accepted. My eyes glanced over the extensive menu, but my mind was set on ordering the "Hot Momma Huda". The sandwich included halal chicken breast, Frank's Red Hot Sauce, ranch, provolone, lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, and banana peppers. I opted out of the ranch and onions for personal reasons and paid my dues and waiting on the sidewalk.About 15 minutes later, I got my sandwich nicely toasted in a brown bag. The sandwiches take a while to be made due to the bread being FRESHLY made to order. Kudos! Who does that nowadays? I headed home to the East Bay and the smell of the sub was delicious. Finally in my kitchen, I opened the sub, and the size was about 8", a little bigger than the standard 6" at Subway.The bread was crunchy, warm, and fresh (wheat). The chicken was flavorful; the veggies were fresh and plentiful; the Frank's sauce was the perfect counter-balance of flavor as it added a kick of spice without overpowering the flavor of the sub's ingredients. The freshly made bread reminded me of fresh bread out of the Subway bakery at 5 or 6 in the morning. Lastly, Ike's gives you a bag of "dirty chips" and I suggest getting the Jalapeo flavored chips to get your taste buds tingling! Long live Ike!!
Don't go on a Saturday, specifically during lunch time!The line gets ridiculously longThe fresh baked bread coming out of the oven and the fresh ingredients, dousing the line as another happy customer passed by with their meal
Wwwhhhattt this place is now closed? I was just here last weekend... How and why?A friend recommended this place while we were visiting SF so we stopped by before heading to the airport. Thanks to other yelpers tips to call in your order we did just that - from right outside Ike's place. Didn't even look at a menu but overheard one of the employees saying the menage-a-trois was his favorite so that's what I got (chicken, honey, honey mustard, BBQ sauce, pepper jack, swiss, and smoked gouda.) The sandwich was ready 30 mins later - calling ahead (even while waiting in line) ended up being faster than actually waiting in line to get to the front where they take your order since by the time we picked up our sandwich, the folks who were in front of us had just started to put in their order. The sandwich was pretty darn delicious - warm, sweet, meaty, tons of veggies, but also extremely juicy and messy. It ended up being around $13 for the sandwich and a bag of chips which is a little bit on the expensive side, but not ridiculous. The bf said it was a glorified Subway but I don't have any complaints.
Delicious sammies, long lines make it tough to enjoy it when you are actually hungry. But it is worth the wait if you want enjoy something that is trending in San Francisco.
Mozzarella sticks are an option for a sandwich topping... Genius!Also, that sauce is noms.Go during an off time (i.e. weekday, maybe, 3pm) and you don't even have to wait in line, and only wait a few minutes for your sammy
Went to Ike's this past week when visiting SF. My BF and I were worried there was going to be a huge line, but we actually didn't wait longer than 10 minutes to get our sandwich. They also have the choice of ordering online! We tried [Name Of Girl I'm Dating] on their Dutch Crunch bread & was stoked it was so yummy! The halal chicken is so tasty! They also gave bag of Dirty Chips & an apple caramel lollipop (brought me back to my elementary school days), which was cute. The sandwiches run about $10 or more & totally worth it.
SF institution, and deservedly so. What's there to say, really? Massive menu of delicious sandwiches. Only (potential) downside is that you pretty much have to take your sandwich to go given the lack of seating. Still worth it.
TOTALLY TOTALLY TOTALLY WORTH THE 30 MINUTE WAIT !! And apparently, that's on a good day.I think I can honestly say that this is the best sandwich I've ever had in my life. The menu is characterized through quirky sandwich names such as "we're just friends" and things of that nature that have no correlation whatsoever to the sandwich. Just another fun component of the restaurant.. juss sayin..- the bread was soft and had filling all the way until the last bite- the meat was shredded and marinated, slathered with the sauce (forgot which one it was)- i bought a $10 souvenir shirt, because yes... it was that good.I suggest eating it as soon as you get it while it's fresh. I ate it about 30 minutes upon retrieving my order, but always wondered what it tasted like fresh. sigh.GO HERE GO HERE GO HERE GO HERE.supposedly it's been featured on food network :)
IKE's serves the best sandwiches I've ever had! I've only been there twice but both of my choices have been delicious. The first time I got the Spiffy Tiffy, which comes with pesto sauce, chicken, mushrooms, cheese, and banana peppers. I really enjoyed the pesto sauce in my sandwich, it added a very special touch. The second time around I got the hot momma, which is a chicken sandwich with hot wing sauce, cheese, and ranch. It literally tastes like a hot wing dipped in ranch..just with bread! AMAZING! My mouth is now watering ! This place is definitely touristy and youll average 10 bucks for a sandwich. Expect to wait for a while too. Ive been to the Redwood City location and SF and both had a long line.worth it!
what? i havn't written a review for IKES?! i must be out of my mind.Honestly, there is plenty of hype for Ike's and there are always going to be be people comparing Ike's to roxy's or little lucas. I love both of the other places but i love Ike's just as much. I feel like they EACH have their own flare to how to make a sandwich good and put a price on it that is almost similiar to each other. my favorites at ikes: SAY HEY and the MATT CAIN on some soft roll or deutch crunch depending on the feely feeeeeel. it hits the spot esp with the jalapeno chips they have that come along with the sandwich. and that sssssauuuucee, whatever is in it, its da bomb DOT com. what sucks? on a weekend, expect to WAIT like an hour for your sandwich. I'd suggest calling in your order and picking it up an hour later cuz it's what you gotta do. you do what it do babyyy. weekdays, arent too bad though!
Can a sandwich really get any better than this? Me thinks not.Following in the footsteps of Man vs. Food's Adam Richman and 1,327 yelpers before me, I ventured to the Castro to the sandwich haven of San Francisco.  Stepping into this hole-in-the-wall for the first time was sensory overload, and clearly my girlfriends and I looked like newbies as we stared at the menu wide-eyed with mouths agape. Sensing it was our first time, the cashier recommended the award winning Menage a Trois and Hot Momma Huda on Dutch Crunch roll (you can't go wrong).  I had no doubt the sandwiches were going to be good, but the first bite was an out of body experience and left me speechless. It's a good thing I couldn't articulate any words because I couldn't stop stuffing my face. Both sandwiches were undeniably scrumptious, but the Menage a Trois took the gold medal by a hair.   We went on a weekday afternoon, and although we beat the rush, our order somehow got lost in the midst of the lunch crowd rush. We waited over 20 minutes for our food, but when they realized they forgot about us, they were deeply apologetic. They made up for it by throwing in a few bags of chips and giving us each a free sandwich at our next visit! The fact that I still gave them 5 stars even though we didn't get to take our first bite until 25 minutes after we ordered speaks highly of the food and service. The staff is super friendly and all the customers receive their brown paper bag of goodies with a smile. I also love that Ike is right there in all the action making the magic happen. Ike's Place is a goldmine for exotic sandwich creations and mind-blowing flavors. And now holds the title of the 'Best Sandwich' I've ever eaten. These sandwiches are filling, messy, and simply delicious, so first-timers, beware. Only come to Ike's Place if you're ready to have your world rocked and have all other sandwiches fail by comparison.
Love, love, love their sandwiches. The 3-Way is by far my favorite sandwich of all time. I crave it all the time. I am so glad they have a location at my school (SFSU) so that I can get my grub on there as much as I go to class.
Solid sandwich. I liked how many varieties and toppings there were. Additionally, the ingredients were very fresh. I would go back here again.
Sandwiches are awesome. Dutch crunch is awesome.Slightly expensive for sandwich but worth it.
This place was a great place for a sandwich! I got to meet Ike and talk about sports, something that was clearly influential in their menu. I had the Matt Cain and will definitely be coming back to try more.
Wow! The spiffy dirty sandwich is a local favorite for a reason! I got the menage a trio and and it was amazing! I recommend ordering side of pickles with it and throwing in some red onions in the sandwich. The voodoo chips are very yummy. A mix of all the best Chip flavors. Lots of flavors of sodas to go with your sandwich too
Simply put a great sandwich.. Don't be scared the Kryptonite is a huge sandwich but when split evenly with 3 people it can be conquered! !!
Is this placed hyped up or what? I know we have Man Vs. Food to thank for that, but I'll be damned if this place isn't pretty amazing. The sandwiches aren't overly complicated, but they have amazing flavor. Go ahead and get yourself the threesome if you haven't been here yet, it's pretty much their signature sammy, and well worth it.If I lived closer, I'd probably be here every week. Although I'd plan to go during off-peak hours because I hate waiting - apparently it wasn't even that busy when I went and it was still a half an hour before I got my food.Overhyped? Yes. Underwhelming? No.Worth a visit. On a weekly basis.
Ok. So here's the deal. I wrote a ... not so great review of Ike's Place in the past beacuse I was thoroughly unimpressed. The owner was kind enough to reach out to me personally, apologize for the experience, explain that they have since moved to a bigger location, and even go so far as to give me his cell phone number in case I wanted to reach out to him. I was really hoping to go back and give Ike's another shot while I was in SF this weekend, but I didn't get the chance.All the same, I am readjusting my review. The sandwiches were good and if all he says is true, I am sure the experience is very different. If not, I am so amazingly impressed by the response from the owner of this establishment that I would be a patron if the experience was the same. This is not the first time an owner has reached out to me, and hopefully it won't be the last, but it is the first time I have changed a review only because of the message the owner conveys.
My first review on Yelp - I love Ike's!The times I've gone to this location, the wait to order has never been over 10 minutes, and then I get my sandwich in another 10 minutes. I've tried the Menage a Trois, the [Name of the Girl I'm Dating], and Hollywood's SF Cheesesteak. I'd say my favorite so far is the Menage a Trois. [Name of Girl] was heavy on the avocado, but still delicious. And the caramel apple lollipop is an awesome idea. I'm always in the mood for one after a sandwich! The employees here are really nice and enthusiastic. I've tried to call in and place an order ahead of time, but the lines are always busy. Actually waiting in line hasn't ever taken me that long though.I love getting Ike's and then walking over to Dolores Park to eat.
Delicious sandwiches to go.PROS: I've been a fan since their first location across the street and have only tried a couple of sandwiches, but one in particular tastes so good that it hurts my heart to breakup with it. It's now a secret menu item (I think?) so I don't even know what the exact name is but just ask for the Barack sandwich on dutch crunch. I have a collection of lollipops piling up that I never get around to eating because the sandwich is so good.CONS: Depending on the day, there might be a bit of a wait, but they have it down to a pretty good system. Sometimes it's actually quicker to show up at the shop than to order online/over the phone ahead of time.
Ike's is good, but is it as good as the long lines, high prices, and hipster fanaticism suggest? I don't think so. Don't get me wrong, I've been here many times and have enjoyed every sandwich I've ever ordered, but I've had better sandwiches and I've had cheaper sandwiches. Still, it's worth checking out, especially if you drive by and the lines are relatively tame.
The kryptonite is ridiculous, 20 bucks seems steep until you get the sandwich and, took 2 meals to get through split with my girlfriend
My husband has been trying all sort of veggie sandwiches at Ike's on his way home without me. It doesn't help that he tells me how delicious they are and I have been wanting to try Ike's for a while. So everytime I go home and see a green lollipop on the coffee table, I am that much more determined to have it as soon as possible. Finally this weekend we made a trip to Castro and Ike's did not disappoint. Following advice on Yelp, I called before we left the house. Since it's weekend and the weather has been perfect, I wasn't surprised that when I called at 6, they told me it won't be ready until 7. Even when we got there at 7, we still had to wait a while, anxiously drooling along with all the other hungry folks who had barely made it before Ike's closes. The staff is extremely friendly and warm, handing out sandwiches in such a personal manner. And even if you arrive a little after 7, chances are, there are people still waiting so they won't really close until about 15 minutes after. I got the "name of the girl I'm dating." I couldn't decide between that and "menage a trois." But at some point, you just have to make a decision despite the very large menu. The sandwich was so delicious! Dutch crunch bread had the perfect texture---able to withstand the drenched sauce but not too hard either. The chicken was tender, and the sauce, yes, the sauce is really what makes it a great sandwich. Really great flavors, but not so overpowering to the point you have no idea if you are eating a piece of chicken or a piece of tomato. And the funky fusion chips bring together the best of both worlds: salt and vinegar, and BBQ. Perfect addition to the great sandwich. I hesitate to say this is the best sandwich I've had, but I just can't think of anything better on top of my head right now. What really bumps this place to a 5 star is my total sympathy for the stupid ordeal they are going with their neighbors. As much as I am all for "let's hear both sides of the stories," sometimes you just wonder what the other side of the story could possibly be. I completely understand the nuisance of noise and having people standing outside my gate all day, and that's why I moved to the Sunset! Hello, why would you choose to live in Castro and then complain about not having your peace and quiet? And to top it off, asking for $1 million as relocation fee really moves you beyond the point of sanity. Maybe if I lived next door to BP, I'd ask them to cough up 1 mil here and there just because, but you are asking a shop that makes sandwiches! I know the sandwich cost like ten bucks, but I honestly don't want to see a cent going to you crazy neighbors.
Dirty sauce ! As a Japanese guy Sandwiches are never my thing. I'd choose riceballs over Sandwiches anytime. BUT - Ike's Sandwiches are the only one I gladly eat. Just amazing.
Great sandwiches, great combinations, and definitely a very San Francisco sandwich shop. I've had a few of their sandwiches but my favorite is Change. By far the best sandwich I've ever had in my life and it will literally change your perception of what a sandwich isIke is the nicest dude on the planet. Not only does he hook his Facebook fans up with endless opportunities for free sandwiches and VIP Skip-the-line Passes (of which I am a proud owner), he saved me from a parking ticket! We thought street cleaning had already come by, but alas it hadn't and he went out of his way to tell us! Stand up guy with a craft for some crazy sandwiches!If you know what you want, CALL YOUR ORDER IN AHEAD OF TIME. It's a time saver and you can plan around grabbing your sandwiches!
Always come here when I visit San Fran. The super mario always hits the spot! There is no place to sit at inside so be prepared to eat in your car! Also, parking is a pain in the ***
Ike's Place serves up some damn good sandwiches. It's funny because there's a lot of stoners in SanFran, and what stoner wouldn't love a place that'll stuff fried mozzarella sticks and jalapeno poppers inside your sandwich?I got the Backstabber, which has halal chicken and artichoke hearts in it. It was really really good. The only thing I don't care for is that there's no tables inside to eat your messy delicious treat at. If you're just visiting SanFran and don't have a place to chill nearby, it makes it tough to fully enjoy this decadent treatwich.
i finally FINALLY tried this place after hearing about it from SO many of my friends and seeing the amount of yelp reviews it was definitely a must have. OMG, it was DEFINITELY NOT a let down. IT WAS SOOO DELICIOUS. BEYOND DELICIOUS. MADE MY TASTE BUDS FLUTTER. I ordered the Menage a Trois and the boyfriend ordered the Elvis. BOTH OF THEM WERE SO AMAZING.... Gosh, words can't even describe it, but i'm going to try.I was a litlte iffy about the menage a trois because of the bbq sauce, but each bite of that sandwich was SO harmonious! Every flavor complimented the other and omg it was so good. The Elvis my boyfriend ordered had wasabi sauce in it. At first bite, my first thought was "omg this tastes a little like sushi!" It was so good. The chicken in both sandwhiches were so moist and tender as well as the dutch bread. DEFINITELY MUST ORDER THE DUTCH BREAD. You can not go wrong.Great experience, TERRIFIC CUSTOMER SERVICE (such JOYFUL ENTHUSIASTIC FRIENDLY workers). I would definitely drive 40 minutes for another sandwich.
So this would be the third or fourth time I have eaten at Ike's, and was excited to have some free time on a Sunday to make the trip out there and get my favorite sandwich (Name of the Girl I'm Dating). The bread is always top notch, you get a free bag of Dirty Brand chips with your meal, and the size of the sandwich is sure to wipe you out for the rest of the day. I don't eat red meat, but I will say many of the sandwiches look amazing. The vegan ones also look pretty appetizing, but I can't seem to stay away from that Halal chicken!So, why the low score then? Well, on this particular Sunday it was packed, as I imagined it would be. There was an announcement made that they were out of Halal chicken but would substitute for fried chicken or turkey. Like I said, I don't eat red meat so none of the other sandwiches were an option. Once I got to register I brought up the idea of substitution again, and it was $2 extra for fried chicken or turkey. So...uh, you ran out of an ingredient and I have to pay extra to still get the sandwich I traveled to get? I chose fried chicken, and was suggested to have no veggies with it so I agreed, still very hesitant about the whole deal but I also didn't want to deal with the mob that was forming behind me. As I ate the sandwich I was reminded of a conversation my friend and I had minutes ago while waiting, I said "see, people will happily pay good money for a good sandwich". Well, as I ate my $11 sandwich, normally $9, I now thought this could have used veggies and a sandwich this expensive that has only dressing, fried chicken, and avocado was not worth the money. I get that this could have been an isolated incident, but I've worked in restaurants and deli's before, and still don't feel good that I had to not only pay more for a substitution, but then the sandwich tasted like something spit out of a deli at a grocery store. Will I go back? Probably not. I realize the next sandwich I get might melt my face again, but now I don't want to risk the money it costs to make it out there only to have this situation repeat itself.
What can I say? I love Ike's - always have, always will.
I'd been wanting to try this place for awhile because of the raving reviews on Yelp. So I was super excited when the day finally came.Maybe my expectations were just too high?Don't get me wrong, the sandwiches were tasty and I liked the dirty sauce (the friend didn't). But I just don't know if they're worth the standing in line. I feel like I could get a decent (similar) if not better sandwich elsewhere without as much hassle.
My son and I were watching an episode of Man vs. Food in San Francisco and Ike's Place was featured. Ever since then, he's been bugging me to come here. So I checked Yelp and this place sounds like a winner. The time to check it out came today and boy...it was everything as advertised. Couldn't find a parking spot, the weather was windy and cold - typical San Francisco so it didn't faze us. Walking here, we knew it was gonna be good judging on the line and how busy this place was. I mean it's a small place but it was buzzing inside. The workers moved in synchronized fashion piling meat and condiments generating wonderful creations. Wow...they have how many sandwich combinations? Not only that, they come up with clever names like Fat Bastard, Al Bundy, Peg Bundy, Flipper and San Francisco sports figures such as Say Hey, Will The Thrill, Barry B., Lincecum, Matt Cain and Montana to Rice just to name a few. I'm beginning to like this place called Ike's Place.The long wait and cold weather was well worth it cause one bite into this sandwich instantly transformed me into my happy spot. My Cal Bears were losing to the USC Condoms but having devoured this made me forget my sorrows and comforted me....at least for a while. However, I'm gonna make a proclamation that Ike's Place is the best sandwich in the Bay Area....maybe in California - bar none!I've found my happy spot....and I'll be back for more.
WOW, This place really blows my mind. These sandwiches are so unique and amazing that the very DEFINITION of "sandwich" has changed in my mind. Oh no, this is not your run of the mill turkey with lettuce and tomatoes. An IKE's sandwich on Dutch Crunch, with dirty sauce baked in, comes with everything in your fattiest dreams. I had a MILF. and I liked it. MILF: Halal Chicken Breast, Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers, Franks Red Hot Sauce, Ranch  + grilled mushrooms Have IKE's blow your mind and redefine your idea of sandwich. Good News: IKE's will be opening up on STANFORD Campus in JUNE. You betcha I'll be there on opening day.
While I was in San Francisco last weekend, my friends and I wanted to try something special and since we remembered seeing this place on a TV show on Food Network, we decided to give it a go.My boyfriend and I ordered the Kryptonite and Damon Bruce sandwich and they were DEEEELICIOUS!Personally for me though, the Kryptonite was such an explosion of flavor I wasn't really able to appreciate all the different flavors in the gigantic sandwich... however the Damon Bruce with the rib-eye cuts and steak sauce topped with onion rings were SO SO GOOD!! This is also pretty close to Dolores Park and Bi-Rite ice cream shop!The line was pretty long but it didn't take too long for us to get our orders since they were super fast! Just be sure to have a plan on where you want to eat since there's very little space available, we just ended up eating on the corner of the street on top of some newspaper stands... haha!
I got the Spiffy Tiffy, which has halal chicken, mushrooms, avocado, pesto, provolone, and pepper jack on dutch crunch. It was a pretty amazing sandwich! There was more stuffing than bread, which is always a plus! The bread was amazing too. Free chips and caramel apple pops with your order too! Some downers: I ordered it extra dirty with stuffed jalapenos but I couldn't taste it. No seating but you can walk down a couple of blocks to the park and enjoy your sandwich.
best sandwich in town!its always a pleasure dealing with mikey who is usually the phone order guy i encounter! he is so knowledgable on every sandwich and knows just what to add and take away to make it my perfect sandwich!whats my sandwich at the moment? the love triangle with sriracha! add a bag of voodoo chips and a blue jolt and IM DONE!
Awesome sandwiches! They're huge and decked with premium meats, fresh veggies, and sumptuous sauces on delicious bread. Since this is SF, obviously they have vegetarian sandwiches and vegan versions of every meat. I was also very pleasantly surprised that they use halal chicken, huge high five for that! We got the spiffy tiffy, the paul reubens, and a couple others. We walked down to Delores Park, sat down on the grass and tried all of them. They were all soooo good. The menu is huge, and I liked pretty much everything I saw on there - I love when a place has classic favorites as well as more exotic, experimental flavor combinations. I need to come back and try new sandwiches each time. I strongly recommend you pull up the menu on their website before you go, or while waiting in the long line.Yeah the line is long, we came on a busy holiday weekend so it was like 40 minutes. You can call ahead and place your order in advance - that's definitely what I'll be doing next time. Regardless, the food here is delicious and it was worth the wait. Highly recommended!
Ordered the Come Home for Thanksgiving and the Pastrami w/ Honey Mustard, both on Dutch Crunch. Called in the order at shortly after 1:10? on a Thursday. Had to wait about 8-10 minutes on the phone because there were two people waiting on the phone ahead of me in queue. They gave us a pickup time of 1:40 pm. We got there closer to 1:30 and our sandwiches were ready for pick-up then! The Pastrami w/ Honey Mustard and Cole Slaw was deelicious. Lots of great flavors. The Come Home for Thanksgiving...liked the idea of sriracha and cranberries mixed together, but thought the Sriracha was a bit overpowering. Would have preferred the sandwich without it. Would definitely get the Pastrami w/ Honey Mustard again. Great portion sizes. Each sandwich came w/ a bag of chips and lollipop! Fun :). Can't wait to try more sandwiches!
My favorite sandwich shop in the Bay Area. SO many vegetarian options. I love it! Always stop here when I'm in the mood for a treat. My favorite is the Meatless Mike. Best vegetarian meatball sub I've ever had!
Ike's Sammie's rock!Ok, It is an expensive sandwich, and no doubt bad for hips as well as the pocket, but they are delicious!! The line can be pretty crazy but a cool feature is call it in before close and collect after. We called a Sammie order in around 6:30pm, they were closing at 7. Then took our sweet time and collected around 7:30pm. We even got a courtesy call to tell us it was ready to go :)Maybe they do healthy options but skip them! You only live once! Don't waste time with a sub-amazing sandwich.Staff are really helpful, guiding you through the intense menu, suggesting sandwiches based on your preferences!Free Chips and Lollipop were a welcome addition.All round great experience!Big up Scoutmob and Ike's for hooking up a free sandwich deal!! p.s. Not that it is concern to me, but good to see tons of Veggie and Vegan offerings on the menu!
Yeah everybody knows ikes is the best
Good sandwich and really tasty, it must be the sauces that make the sandwich.
I love their dutch crunch bread, dirty sauce, and red pesto sauce. However, I hate parking and the fact that there are no tables to eat my sandwich. Ike's Place has great service and they are very earth friendly. Cool! Free bags of chips, even better! Aww, they leave caramel apple lollipops as a surprise in our sandwich bags, how sweet! I ordered the Jim Rome on Dutch Crunch bread even though it wasn't listed on their menu. It's a turkey sandwich with Ike's red pesto, avocado, and cheddar. I requested for jalapenos and red onions, but they forgot. I wasn't too upset about it but I do wish that they put it in there. My sandwich probably would've tasted better. Overall, I was only a fan of the dutch crunch bread, dirty sauce, and red pesto the sandwich as a whole wasn't the best I ever had. I think it's because the avocado was really overpowering my sandwich. I also didn't like the fact that my sandwich was falling apart before my eyes. My bf got the the Menage a Trois and said it was delicious! My cousin got the Spiffy Tiffy and loved it as well. I guess I was the only one who wasn't in love. I'll probably have to come here a couple of times and try different sandwiches till I find, the ONE.Ike's Place is a guilty indulgence. Sandwiches have the misconception of being really healthy but if you come to Ike's you're tempted to get something that is probably greasy and fatty. They do have healthy options and so accommodating to everyone's special diet, you can't really go wrong.
My favorite sandwich shop! Why can't we have a restaurant like this in Vegas? We stop by here everytime we are in SF and always try a different sandwich. The last we ordered an SF Giants and the Al Bundy. The SF Giants is only turkey, Swiss, and bacon but the sandwich has soo much flavor. My gf ordered the Al Bundy and since I had to fight to get a bite you can imagine how good it was. Also big thumbs up for them letting you pick up your order up to an hour after they close. Our flight got in late so this was the only way we could enjoy these tasty sandwiches on our trip.
I love DUTCH CRUNCH BREAD. The sandwiches here are delicious, but what really MAKES them awesome is the Dutch Crunch. Each sandwich comes with chips, and they have a great selection of indie sodas. The sauces and options for the sandwich are also wonderful... jalapeno poppers, various sauces... try them all... but don't forget to savor the Dutch Crunch. There's no place to sit and eat, so either p/u, take home, or walk to the park and have a nice lunch if the weather permits.BTW, did I mention this place has Dutch Crunch bread?
After a long day at the Academy of Sciences, my boyfriend and I decided to come here. One of the reasons why we chose this place was that one of my friends who worked here told me that they were closing it down next week (August 26th by 6am). I was pretty bummed that they were closing this place down cause it's seriously one of the best sandwich places I've ever been too. Now I gotta drive all the way to Redwood City just to get me some Ike's. Anyways, there was a line like usual when we got there. When we got the menu, my boyfriend and I were so picky because we wanted to try something different than the ones we tried last time. I ended up getting the Fat Bastard while he got the Tony Soprano. Chips are also included in your sandwiches. I usually finish my chips to kill time. Lol. The wait to get our sandwiches took a while since it was pretty busy but so worth it. The sandwich was so huge like usual that it was my lunch and dinner that day. I'm seriously gonna miss Ike's. I'm hoping they'll open a new store somewhere else in SF where people won't be complaining.
The sandwiches live up to the hype in terms of quality.In terms of price (and coming from Boston) they are overpriced. I paid $12 for one regular-sized, medium sandwich. You could get the same sandwich at Subway for $6.00.As of 2013, there still isn't anything to sit on except for the small window sill. It's really weird man. Are they so good that they can't provide chairs?
This place is legit (and totally worth the wait). Plus they have halal chicken! I tried the buffalo chicken sando which was off the hook. I will definitely return, inshallah.
Can't really order a bad sandwich here! One note though: they add their "dirty sauce" to every sandwich. If you aren't a mayo fan, you need to ask specifically to leave the dirty sauce off. Pricing is reasonable, though be prepared to wait a hot second for your order as the sandwiches are definitely made with love.
I had the pleasure of meeting Ike and his beautiful fianc. I told them I've never been to Ike's (I know, I must be the last person on earth) and he gave me a free sandwich! The vegetarian Ugly Owl with sourdough bread. Delicious, teriyaki sweet, horseradish? zing. The sauce was a bit on the heavy side but let's not lie, I enjoyed every bite and could see myself enjoying this sandwich just as it is in all its saucy-ness, drool. Came with a bag of chips, caramel apple lollipop, and smiles from Ike's crew. Good vibes. Place is decorated with children's art. Vegetarian or not, try their Ugly Owl. It's delicious. I was able to split my sandwich for two meals. Thanks, Ike!! Yes, Love and Sandwiches indeed.
I mean of course I LOVE ikes. I've been going to Ikes ever since they kept moving places from their original location, to their make shift pop up shop to their new location. I've utilized their iphone app and ordered sandwiches for pick up and I think it is AWESOME! Especially when you see the line out the door, you're like phew I dodged a bullet. I personally like the Barry B or SF Giants on Dutch Crunch. They recently changed their chips but they're still good. I also get excited to eat the caramel apple lollypop afterwards if I decide I'm not going to get bi-rite.
What an amazing sandwich! Sandwiches can be bland and boring, but Ike's makes a sandwich that you just want more of. I ordered the manage a trois and it was flavorful, moist and juicy, with tender pieces of chicken on a chewy dutch crunch roll. The barbecue sauce was a bit sweet, but the flavor was great, with the honey mustard.The only negative is the wait. We waited more than 30 minutes after ordering to receive our sandwich. It's probably the longest I've ever waited for a sandwich.
I would normally give Ike's a four star review based on their sandwiches, but the get 5 stars for creativity! No where else can you get a sandwich like Ike's! It is the most unique sandwich spot I have ever visited! The Heath Ledger is my favorite! I still want to hear someone order "your girlfriends name" sandwich, but I will patiently wait.
Great sandwiches ever time!! love the change and the voodoo chicks.
Best sandwich in the the world!
Great sauces and easy set up.
Great selection. I love the chips.Walked in the rain to eat here.
Ike's makes a huge variety of sandwiches including tons of vegan and veggie options. I had the "Vegan Eli Manning" which consisted of Vegan Turkey, Garlic and Herb Sauce, Mushrooms, Avocado, Soy Cheese. The sandwiches are served with your choice of Vegan Dirty Sauce, Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onions, Pickles, Banana Peppers. I had everything on mine and chose wheat bread. The wheat roll was really fresh and delicious. My sandwich was really tasty and huge. The sauces and veggies gave the sandwich lots of flavor and the vegan turkey had a good texture and flavor. I also had a locally made chai cola which was refreshing. They also throw in a lolly pop with each sandwich. Expect a line and to wait a while once you order because they cook the sandwiches to order. The kitchen is a tiny place and the cashier stands out on the street to take orders. There are no tables or places to sit so we walked over to Delores park and had a picnic.Overall a really delicious and satisfying option for lunch when in the Castro/Mission neighborhood.
This place only has its following because it was on the food network. Overrated. I get a better sandwich at Molly Stones
Sometimes I'm a vegetarian and sometimes I crave a mnage a trois and sometimes I'm an insert name of "girl" I'm dating here. Although I've never dated a girl. I know I'm a conundrum.Ike's doesn't need another review deconstructing their product. Reasonably priced. You get chip and a lollipop. And it's yummy. DONE!
Came here for the second time and it's such an amaze-ball! I can't believe they're going to be closed.. for good :( I'm sad.. I shall definitely try the one in Redwood City next time!I ordered the "Fat Bastard" and it's was good! Yeah it's pretty simple just ham cheese dirty sauce with avocado nom! love it! Unfortunately they ran out of lettuce that day, but still the sandwich was amazing! 5 starrrr!
Since this place already has bazillion glowing reviews, I figured what's another one, right?Hubby and I were blowing through town on the way to the airport after a sublime weekend in Napa and we decided to stop in for a sammich from Ike's. We did the right thing and called ahead 20 minutes outside of SF proper.It sounded like there were conditions as to how many sandwiches you can call in for because the guy sounded hesitant to take my order until I told him it was only for 2. I was quite surprised given that it was 3pm and therefore not peak meal time. Boy was I wrong. As we pulled up to the front of the restaurant, there were plenty of people hanging around outside waiting for their order. However, we couldn't have timed it more perfectly. We waitied a few minutes until the designated time the guy told us our sandwiches would be ready and then got in the line. As we waited in front of the register, my name was called and our sandwiches ready. We went with the Superman and Hot Date for Fire - we didn't see this on their menu board so I'm glad we looked on line. Both sandwiches were AAAAAHHH - awesome! I'm not usually a huge fan of sandwiches but these were soooo good. I regret not having eaten them in the car on the way to the airport but even cold at the airport and for lunch at work the next day, they were delicious. Four thumbs up (hubby + me)!!
I came here today with a friend, and it was delicious. My friend was ecstatic about it and after I checked out the menu, I had to try it out. Ike's is a little place with no seating area, but you could tell it was good by the ample amount of people in there and the long line of people waiting to place an order and waiting for their food. Ike's is a special sandwich place. They have very unique menu, with sandwiches ranging from normal sandwiches to outrageous sandwiches with dozens of ingredients. Monster sandwiches, if you will. They have unique ingredients in some of their sandwiches, like beer battered onion rings and fried mozzarella sticks. They also have a special sauce that they put all over, which is super delicious. In the end, I had an amazing sandwich, the Damon Bruce, which was so good. I would definitely eat there again, I think it's one of the best sandwiches I've had in my life. San Francisco is a bit far for a sandwich though, so I might have to try their location on Stanford.
--GeneralFinally came here after hearing so much about it all these years! Definitely very popular as you can see by the reviews. Close to the BART station, so it's walkable. Delicious non-typical sandwiches, and definitely worth a try!--FoodThey use a special sauce that pretty much makes the sandwich. Their meat quality is really good too, I got the sliced rib eye sandwich. Awesome, solid sandwich but eat them fresh because they can get soggy from the sauces.Recommended to try as they have a lot of unique sandwiches.
I truly must be some kind of idiot for not having had Ike's after three years of living here.If you are visiting SF, use the Android/iPad/iPhone app and order ahead of time - will save you from wasting your precious weirdo-watching-time in Dolores. I ordered an hour before pickup and got my sandwich straightaway. Super Mario FTW.Also? Mozarella sticks in sandos? #WHYDIDNTITHINKOFTHAT
Man, I am craving Ike's nonstop since first visiting here. I got the menage a trois on Dutch Crunch bread. I would recommend the voodoo chips with the sandwich. Next time I go, I might make it dirty to see if it is worth it!
Lured by a scoutmob offer for a free small Elvis Kieth sandwich, I finally ventured up to the City to visit Ike's in SF. I'd been to the ones at Stanford and Redwood Shores before, but it was fun to see the mothership (v2.0).The staff was very friendly, more friendly than my experiences at the Peninsula baby ships, and happy to honor my scoutmob offer. The line was also much shorter than I expected, but maybe that's because I got there at 10:40am on a Saturday.The Elvis Keith sandwich - halal chicken, teriyaki, wasabi mayo, swiss on dutch crunch - had a nice combination of flavors, but I wish that the chicken had been more tender, and the wasabi mayo had more wasabi in it. With all the other sauces and fillings, the Swiss cheese seemed a bit superfluous to me. Still, it was warm, tasty and, above all, free! 5 stars for that!
The line is insane! (that is what they got -1 star for) But the food is also CRAZY and really SF style. I got the menagie tio sandwich (halal chicken, honey, dutch crunch, the works) and made it extra dirty (added mozzarella sticks, jalapeno poppers). It also comes with chips, always a nice addition to a sandwich. There is also no were to really to sit at the place, which sucks. And it really is not the type of place that I would come often. But if you want your sandwich fix, it is the place to go.
It's not just hype - these guys actually make delicious sandwiches. My favorite is "We're just friends".
A weekend up in the city and before we even actually get there, we already decided that we were going to grab sandwiches from Ike's while we're there -- no ifs, ands, or buts! Yup, planning ahead to grab sandwiches, that says something right there!It's just as super friggin delicious as I remembered it to be when we first tried this place out 8 months ago, if not better! Their P.Z. Burger is still THE best burger ever! It totally beats out any burger you'll have from any actual burger joints! We got the Menage-A-Trois and the Barry B as well. Both also just absolutely delicious! The wait for us, as expected, was a little long, but if you could just be patient, it's well worth it, trust me! Props to the girl working the cash register too, she kept up a perky attitude the whole time and interacted with each and every customer who's turn it was to order. She didn't rush anyone, answered questions, explained everything.. as if there wasn't even a long line of people.Ike, himself, was working that day and hand delivered our sandwiches to us waiting outside, and we ended up having a conversation with him. Very cool guy. Got a picture with him too. Something to remember me with Ike, and my menage-a-trois.... sandwich, hahaReally though, one bite out of any of Ike's sandwiches, and you'll be convinced these are the best sandwiches ever, seriously!
Decor - AverageAmbiance - AverageFood - High point !Service - Good (was pretty crowded, still they were well managed)Would I go back ? - Yes, definitely !
Hmm, it takes a bit of courage to write a so-so review of a top-rated place, but here we go.  Location was no problem, and the line was short (2-3people in front of me mid-afternoon).  The staff were friendly, but I did not appreciate the overflowing recycling bins right in the middle of the place. I got the 'Name-of-the-girl-I-m-dating' sandwich (basically chicken with sauce and some avocado). Hungry as I was, I then walked up to Duboce park (my favorite in the are), opened up my elaborately wrapped sandwich aaaaaand...not much happened. Yes, soggy chicken with a little bit of avocado. The bread was ok, just crunchy enough, but the filling was...well...normal.  Maybe me and my sandwich just didn't hit it off, but it is what it is. Three stars for average food that didn't live up to the hype.
Was in the City for Fleet Week kickoff with the husband and the offspring and thought to grab lunch at Ike's Place. Had to pass the sorta creepy naked people at Market and Castro. That was funny. Kids tried to walk past and look but not look. First time we've been here and might be the last time we come on a weekend. Too crowded and takes too long for sandwiches to be made. Even if they are pretty tasty. Highly recommend the Lincecum and the Nacho Boy. Kids liked the array of chips and want to come back to try the blue Jolt soda. Yeah, no.Jonesin' for a Lincecum right now...hmmm. May be a day for a road trip.
Bang Bang Bang'n! Food to go - no seating people! $10 for a Dirty Curtis, chips and drink. I would go back, but not until the end of the day -- line gets too long. Tip: call in your order and pick it up an hour later.... the menu is overwhelming, so try to figure it out ahead of time!
Hands down, one of the best sandwiches I've ever tried. I absolutely love the Fat Bastard sandwich (with jalapenos to add some kick) on a dutch crunch bread. Luckily for me, the wait isn't as long as others have experienced. I go there as soon as it opens (10AM) and there's hardly, if ever, anyone in line. I almost cried when I heard the news on Facebook that they were going to be closing the day before I was supposed to head up there. But they didn't and my tummy is now a happy tummy!
get the matt cain! or if you don't want anything off their reg menu ask about their secret menu!!
Absolutely wonderful. We went here for a quick birthday lunch. The line was long but moved very quickly. Best Sandwich I have ever eaten.
So i keep hearing all this talk about Ike's Place and decided to go out on an adventure for it on a nice sunny day. WOW!! The WHOLE process from waiting, ordering, and THEN finally receiving my "Cristina and Umair Go to Ike's Place" sammich took about an hour and half. The sandwich comprise of Turkey, Bacon, Ham, Salami, Italian Dressing, Avocado, Provolone. Yumm!! The sandwich overall was pretty good but the only thing i wasnt that pleased was the fact that there was no CRUNCH in my Dutch Crunch =[I was eating my sandwich basically on a regular loaf of bread that looked like it had some crunch in it but... no crunch.Besides the not so easy to find parking, crazy long wait and no crunch in dutch crunch, i say.. it's something worth trying to see whats the hype all about.
OMG OMG OMG! I finally went...after hearing about this place from everyone, including my sister who is not a huge sammich fan! I tried their Jim Rome (turkey, cheddar, avo, and all their regular fixin's plus dirty sauce, and I asked for 'No Mayo") Imagine the look on my face when they said...happy hour 4-7 p.m. Mon-Thurs, which is a free bag of chips and a drink if you get a sammich over X-amount (I think it's over $6.75 but I don't want to misrepresent!) :D Omnomnomnom...Not much by way of seating, y'all, so take it home or sit at the park nearby. :P Gotta love the fact that this 'hole in a wall' place takes plastic too! Oh and if you don't know what to order...ask for the 'full menu' and read it outside. :P
Delicious vegan options! I am a big fan!
Not wanting to wait in line for hours for a sandwich, I called in my order to Ike's. After you let Ike's know how many sandwiches you are ordering, they give you an estimate time of pick up.The pick-up line was substantially shorter than the regular order line. I was in line 5 minutes at most before I was escorted into Ike's. Man that place is super tiny. No wonder there's a huge line on the sidewalk like there's a velvet rope keeping everyone out of the most fabulous club. Confusion ensued, but within the chaos there was order. Ike's has a system. When given the okay, you get to go inside with your party, pick your Dirty chips and drinks, pay, and be off on your merry way. And despite being extremely busy, the staff is very friendly. Vegan Tom Brady $12.21Vegan breaded chicken, zesty garlic and herb sauce, mushrooms, avocado, soy cheese. I had the vegan Tom Brady, on Dutch crunch of course. It was really good, and the vegan chicken was surprisingly tasty and had a good texture. My only gripe is that there was way too much avocado, but I can see how that may be a plus for some. What made the sandwich for me was the way the Dutch crunch was pressed hot. Delicious!I still prefer Little Lucca's. However, Ike's is closer and has a huge vegan and vegetarian menu.
I can't believe I haven't written a review yet!Can't add much more to all the reviews...but my experiences have been awesome. So awesome that I've introduced multiple friends to Ikes.I split the Superman and Menage a Trois with 2 guys after they did some exercise. Wait. I just got this. Ewww...yeah...no. Not like that. But seriously, they have a sandwich called Menage a Trois, which is just YUMMY. Kinda barbeque-y. Chicken. Good. Superman sandwich was HUGE and filled with food. It has bacon. And Avocado. And 7 different kinds of meat. I think it was suppose to come on one huge bread, but since they ran out, the dudes just made it using 2 small breads. If you like meat...and like a huge sammie, THIS IS IT!! They also give you a free caramel apple pop with your sandwich.I've also heard of the Kryptonite, but my stomach cannot handle that type of meat/size. Alas, I fail. But Ikes, you are BOMB!FYI, you can call in an order and save some time waiting. Parking in the area is all street, and there's a middle school across the street. If you're willing to brave the long lines on weekends, its worth it. Otherwise, do like me and show up at 2PM for a mere 15-20 minute wait.
I like Ike! If I still had my mom's little button from the Eisenhower era that said as much I would don it proudly. I honestly can't believe I haven't reviewed Ike's before!The best time to go is during a weekday to avoid the rush, and either before or after lunch time on any day. I like to call ahead but if it's a warm saturday afternoon your sandwhich might take over an hour till it's ready. The people there are always friendly and funny. They have tasty drinks and of course a lollipop with every sandwich. This is the best hangover meal because it's beyond filling but it's not totally like eating the greasy food from your local diner. You can get them to go since there is limited outdoor seating only, but they tend to get a little soggy so fresh is best.My husband likes the "Pride of the Castro" which has turkey, ham and brie. Other favs are the "Just Friends" (Halal Chicken Breast, Sweet Orange Glaze, Avocado, PepperJack) and the "Get Over it" (Halal Chicken Breast, Mozzarella Sticks, Honey Mustard, Avocado) One of the best things is adding to a sandwich: Pineapple? YES! Mozzarella sticks? YES! Onion rings? YES! Put it all on there if you want!The mutt comes along and if we score a table she sits in the shade underneath. Otherwise we are perfectly happy to grab a spot on the curb to enjoy one of life's simply pleasures: a fabulous sandwich.
While sitting in as audience members on a taping of "Important Things with Demetri Martin," our warm-up comedian guy asked about things to do in San Francisco. When he got onto figuring out where to eat, people yelled out a few mediocre options (Farolito's? PASS) and a guy two rows ahead of me yelled "IKE'S" - as if on cue, my buddy and I immediately shot up and screamed out "YEAH! IKE'S! YEAH!"This kind of enthusiasm for a restaurant is something I've been lacking in my life. But now, I can say that the lust and drive for a place to eat (or rather, a place in San Francisco) is back. I love sandwiches, and the only thing I love more than a sandwich is a sandwich done right. This place hits it on the head with acute precision. To date, I've had the Backstabber, the Eli Manning, the Hugh Hefner, We're Just Friends and the Meatless Mike. All were fantastic in their own subtle ways. Perhaps the most amazing thing about this place is that just about any sandwich can be made vegan - and if making it vegan will take away one of the key flavours or components, employees are always quick to tell you and suggest a sandwich you may like just as much, if not more.The seating situation is relatively lame, but that's just all the more reason to grab a few on a nice day and head the few blocks to D.P. to enjoy your meal. And don't let the long lines and wait deter you - this hot sandwich is definitely worth it.
5 stars no question about it. I cant say anything different than what has already been said over 2000 times below. Ike's has very very good sandwiches. It is in fact the best sandwich I have eaten to this day. I had the Manage a Trois which was saucy and delicious. Be prepared to be a little messy with this sandwich and also very satisfied. I can say its probably a good idea to call ahead and order over the phone so that you dont have to stand in long line. Also I think its cash only or atleast it seemed to be that way. If you dont have cash run across Market street to the Wells Fargo ATM. Inspite of the busy atmosphere the cashier and others feeding the crowds are very cool and courteous. There is no place to sit and eat out there, so consider going somewhere after you grab your sandwiches to comfortably enjoy it. Damn even the carmel apple lollipop is good.
I was super happy that a friend suggested we make a day of going out here to get some Ike's sandwiches because 1) I have been hearing about it for a longggg time and wanted to try "one of the best sandwiches ever" and 2) to knock off another item off the big eats list.#100 on the SF big eats list - menage trois sandwich did not disappoint at all! It definitely lived up to it's hype from reviewers and on "man vs food" I was a little hesitant about ordering it because the reviews said that it was very sweet and I am not a fan of sweet meats at all. But seeing how I was at Ike's on this rare occasion, I just had to commit to the list. I asked for it to be light with the honey and added avocado and (free) pesto sauce. Wow... it seriously is one of the best sandwiches EVER! Ordered the change sandwich for the boyfriend to try. Relating back to my dislike of sweet meat, I did not like the BBQ sauce and I expected the onion ring to be crispier/crunchier. But the meat was very tender and I would recommend this sandwich for anyone that likes BBQ.Each order of sandwich comes with free chips and a caramel apple lollipop.. I have not had one since high school! I enjoyed my sea salt and vinegar chips as I waited for my sandwich. Thankfully it was a beautiful Sunday afternoon in SF and I was with good company which made the 1.5 hour wait endurable, not to mention the great sandwich I got in the end!
After reading sooooo many good reviews about this place, I thought I was gonna eat the best sandwich ever. The sandwich was good, but not the best.I tried the Menage a Trois on dutch crunch bread. It was good, but it did not wow me that I would want to go out of my way for this sandwich.
Long... long... wait. Nowhere to sit. Too many options to choose from, so it is rough on the brain.But... their sandwiches are worth every bit of struggle! Easily the best sandwiches I've had, and I have had sandwiches everywhere.My favorite so far: Hot Momma Huda
Ike's isn't as good as Little Lucca's, but it's pretty damn good.Pros: Crazy number of vegetarian and vegan options, killer dutch crunch rolls, dirty sauce, creative use of advertisement through social media, the one and only charming Mr. Shehadeh, and distinctive garlicky flavor!Cons: Not as tasty nor cheap as Little Lucca's.'Nough said, given the number of reviews Ike's Place has already accumulated.
Love Love IKe's Finger-licking Sandwiches. The dirty sauce is the da bomb. I always get the Strawberry Girl but sandwiches have different names in different locations. Great Place for Vegeterians. Free Birthday sandwich if you're on their email list and get the cupon. The only thing is that they are soo busy sometimes that my order gets messed up..instead of light sesame sauce, i got alot of it! But still, the sandwich was delicious!This is my all-time favorite sandwich place!
I did not like their special sauce. The dutch crunch was ok. The price was too high for the quality and taste.
A place like this needs no introduction: it's the legendary Ike's Place, a sandwich shop full of personality and flavor. You've more than likely have heard about this place, and based on my experience, the hype is justified.As a note, I went here at 11 AM on a Friday. There was no one in line. Yes, I'm a college kid that was on break at the time. It's always a good idea to try to avoid the lunch rush if you can.The sandwich I ordered was called "Get Over It." However, it was a sandwich that I was told that I "unlocked," because I ordered a [Name of Girl I'm Dating] with MOZZERELLA STICKS INSIDE OF IT. The difference between the two is that the latter contains pepper jack cheese. Although I love pepper jack, I ordered the sandwich because the cashier made it seem as if it was a "secret," which made it more fun!Anecdotes aside, the sandwich had halal chicken, avocado, honey mustard, and mozzarella sticks. It was delicious. It's the kind of sandwich where you can taste what you wanted when you wanted. Like: "I love avocado, oh there's some IN MY SANDWICH. I like mozzarella sticks, OH THERE'S SO TOO. Hey is that CHICKEN?"The prices are high. $10 for their basic sandwich is pretty pricey, and that may throw off some people. And the sandwich I got set my wallet back $13. However, the sandwiches come with a bag of kettle chips and a SURPRISE CARAMEL LOLLIPOP.Ike's Place is great. It feels like an old friend, that I'm sure I'll want to visit again in the future.
My husband tried their sandwiches he said one if the best sandwiches he ever had. Me- I'm not an avid sandwich person I loved their zappo voodoo New Orleans kettle style chips!!! Where else can I get a bigger bag of those?? I want to bring back in Philly! Will come back for that voodoo chips this tues before my red eye flight!!! Will u ls give me discount ;)
I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet. Just go. It's amazing.Some faves: Hot Mama Huda, Matt Cain, Menage a Trois. But my new favorite, and I might be a little biased, is the Jaymee Sirewich. I mean, I made it up so I better like it. Fried Chicken, Ike's Yellow BBQ sauce, Pepper Jack, Ranch. I get it on Dutch Crunch, add jalapenos and pepperocinis. This sandwich is NOT healthy, but it's SO, SO good. Get it! You'll thank me later.
Awesome. This place is all about " don't judge a book by its cover. " give it a try. I got the Eli manning
Best sandwich ever. Try it on the dutch crunch.
Grab a sandwich; any will do. Pretty damn low risk with very evident payoff.
One of the tastiest sandwiches I ever had. We tried Hollywood's SF Cheesesteak which was amazing. Also the Spiffy Tiffy had a heavenly taste. They come with a small bag of potato chips. A must go for sandwich lovers. It always has a long line and there are not that many sitting spots available. There is no wait list as well. You have to stay in the line until it is your turn.
Me: Could I get a Kryptonite?Cashier: Sure, anything else?Friend: Yeah, could I get a Nacho Boy?Cashier: Wait, do you guys know how big a Kryptonite is?Me: Uhh... I'm REALLY hungry. It's okay.Cashier: Are you sure?Me: Yeah! I'm starving.Cashier: Alriiight, your total is going to be $33 something.Then we found out that the Kryptonite was a $20 sandwich ($21.60 to be exact) and opted out of Nacho Boy. HOLY CRAP!! RIDONKULOUS.Okay, seriously, this sandwich can feed three people. It was insanely huge. I couldn't even finish my half of the sandwich. It was really good, though. I'm sure all of their sandwiches are really good, so I don't need to explain myself. I'm also sure that "really good" is an understatement.AAAAAAND the Dutch Crunch? YEAAAAH I love daaaaht. Light crunch, not hard, realllll tasty bread. I wish all bread was like that. YOM.P.S. Dolores Park is a short little walk away if you want to enjoy your sandwich there :)!
I stopped going to Ike's for two years because it just became a mess. Prices went up, lines got longer, and outside seating disappeared. On top of that the sandwiches' yummy uniqueness runs thin over time.I decided to go back with the family today. Despite the bigger space nothing at Ike's has changed. The kitchen is huge but barely staffed. The girl at the counter was very slow. The line was around the block. And, to add insult to injury, Ike's now employs a bouncer. Yes, A BOUNCER. He stands around outside making sure you aren't in blocking neighbors' stairs and that the line goes in the right direction.At this point Ike is basically some jerk trying to keep the hype alive as best he can. He moved into another small space in the same area where people complained him out of business before. The kitchen is too big for it's staff and it's purpose. He could easily push the wall back and make a seating area, but he won't. He wants the drama.The sandwich itself was good, but had too much mayo. They also force you to have a bag of chips with your sandwich now. I rather pay $1.50 less and not get chips, but it isn't an option. I'll come back in two more years and see if things improve.Update: Ike wrote me a very long and odd letter offering me free food and the ability to skip the line whenever I like, as well as his personal cell phone number. You have a sandwich place, Ike, not some exclusive underground dance club populated by underwear models. I don't want the bouncer to wave me in, I just want you to iron out your capacity problems.
i gave up my ex-boyfriend for Tony Soprano. Unfortunately, it wasn't better than [name of the girl I'm dating]. Maybe i should have tried a menage a trois with some EXTRA dirty sauce? Now, if you're familiar with the menu at Ike's, you know that this means i am neither: a cheater, bi-sexual, homosexual, nor am i interested in a sexual liaison among other people (sorry). Instead, i am reveling at Ike's unconventional and enticing sandwich names, which are just as desirable as his food;I mean, c'mon, who doesn't want a Sexy Boy or a 'Hella' Fat Bastard? Here, I tasted the best fusion of quality meat, bread, sauces and veges in one of the happiest places i know. literally. This gem is located in the Castro and is streets down from Dolores Park (great place to sit and enjoy). Ike's use of Halal meats and ability to cater to all types of consumers, including meat lovers, vegetarians and Vegans, really tickles my fancy. This place should be proclaimed the deity of deli's. Do you body a favor and get one.
So this six star review is dragging me out of my yelp review comma!6 STARSIke's absolutely deserves every 5 star rating they get.What you should know:Order via phone for pickup (You will avoid a massive line.)Join their email list. (You will get coupons)Order what people quick tip about (Menage a Trois & Matt Cain = Woohoo so A+++++ good. The Hella Fat Bastard & Elvis Keith (free half from Scoutmob THANKS) are also good but just not special like Menage & Cain.Some other things worth noting are the cool t-shirts for sale, delicious chips that come with a full sandwich, and the cool on-top-of-it folks working there. It is quite the operation. Great success! I'm so excited to be Ike's new around the corner neighbor and can't wait to return.We are working our way down the super long menu, so updates to come.
I had a King Koopa from here today for the first time. It amazingly lives up to the hype.
BOOM. Can't say anything that everyone else hasn't said. Sandwiches are LEGIT. Be prepared for a food coma afterwards.
Review #1435!!!!!!!!WOW, Ike's was something else. My girl first found it on Yelp while looking for sweet vegan spots. We've never seen anything on Yelp with so many reviews! Incredible we had to check it out. THE LINE WAS OUT THE DOOR and DOWN the street to the car repair shop. UNBELIEVEABLE.We arrived at like 1pm. We didn't get our sandwich till almost 2. We had to wait like 25 min in line and another, 15-20 to get the sandwich?THE SMART people called in their order. You can do the same!The MENU options are incredible. There's a general section, vegetarian section, and VEGAN section. Unless otherwise noted, everything comes with their DIRTY SAUCE, it's a secret concoction of deliciousness. The item names are hilarious. There's like, "Let's just be friends," "MILF," "Nacho Man," "Sexy Boy." Etc etc. I got the "Vegan Cow Tipper" with avocado and pineapple. It was a winner, man, no kidding.We mistaked the cashier for IKE. Nono, that was Alex. He was hella funny, he's like nah, Ike is much shorter like Yay high. He's like never here but TODAY, he's on sandwiches. He never works! hahaSo yea, totally went inside to say hi to Ike. He came from behind the counter, took off his glove and shook my hand. Hella cool dude. Really happy to meet people who come by. We're like hey! We're all the way from San Jose!So we waited outside, sipping a bottle of HONEST tea. Good stuff. Just chillin. Finally got the long awaited holy grail of a sandwich. Inspired, we totally asked Ike for a picture. He was hella happy. I'm posting it up right after this. So wow, hella rare to meet the owner and have him be so chill all the way through. Just really happy, was eating it afterwards and WOW, hella worth it. I hella wanted to go back and get in line again. My girl was like nooo! hahahaSo yea, parking is a lil challenging, but it's in a semi-quiet residential zone anyway. There's no where really to eat it, but we walked down the street and sat on the steps of some houses to handle the munchies anyway.So yea, ENJOY IKE'S! iT'S HELLA BOMB!Say hi to Alex the cool shaved head cashier man and yo, definitely throw a shout out to the man of the house, IKE himself! Holla!They close at 10pm too!So yea, just hella cool people there. I think everyone is a friend of Ike's from way back and have known him forever. Just a totally cool vibe.IF YOU CAN GET FRENCH FRY's, that's a freakin miracle there. THey hella stock up at the beginning of the week and the completely run out towards the end, even with their immense inventory of fries. It's incredible. The guys in front of me were hella sad. GOOD LUCK!!!!
Two words: Kryptonite sandwich! Get that. Nothing else. My memory is a little hazy, but I recall 3 or 4 different kinds of meat, their awesome possum dirty sauce, jalapeno poppers, onions rings, and mozzarella cheese sticks, and some other sandwich essentials like your cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes. A sandwich really can't get any better than this! Don't get greedy. Share this sandwich with a friend or two, or you'll have enough for dinner. I hate waiting in line so I call in an order around 2 or 3, and it's ready for pickup in about 15 or 20 minutes. It's an expensive sandwich, but just find a friend to split the cost and share it with. It's been a while since I've had it, but I think it's a whopping $15 or $20. A little pricey for a sandwich, but I promise it's worth it every time. I need to get my Ike's fix when I'm in San Francisco!
Did I really not review this place yet? I've only been once and that is quite a shame. I ordered the Nacho Boy: roast beef, mushrooms, avocado, swiss. I added bacon as well. Sandwich was to DIE for. It was huge, gooey, fresh, and tasty as a mother effer. So much avocado -- no skimping here. We didn't wait long -- they actually walk out and bring the sandwich to you in a bag -- nice touch. This is definitely a staple of the city -- makes you proud to live and be from the Bay Area. Look at me getting choked up over a sandwich -- it's that good, though. Don't believe me? Pfft. Your loss. No, I'm serious. YOUR. LOSS. GO. NOW.
If you like buffalo wings, get the hot mama. You won't regret it!
I work a few blocks away and Ike's is a convenient sandwich spot. The lines do get long and occasionally my order does get messed up. Overall a good spot though. The Matt Cain is one of my favorite things on the menu.
jalapeno poppers on my sandwich? YEAH!
Damn it Ike's! I love your sandwiches but the consistently long waits and messed up orders are making me have second thoughts. I waited for 1 hour and 20 mins for the glorious veggie 16th and market sandwich only to return to my office and find it avocado-less and dry. This is the 3rd time my order was missing a key delicious ingredient. Yves faux turkey and msf's faux bacon are cheap, so what am I really paying for?Expand your business to a larger space so we can have your delicious sandwiches in less time and of better quality.
Delicious! The value is incredible, and all of the emplyees are super laid-back and helpful. I highly recommend this place.
My husband travels to San Francisco often and had never heard of this place. We were staying overnight on our way to Napa with friends and the husband of the other couple found this place on Yelp. When we arrived, it was lunchtime and there was quite a line. It moved a bit slowly as one of the cashiers was on the phone for quite some time with a phone order. If I have any complaint about this place, it's that there should be a phone order only cashier and two to handle the in-store customers. I am a pescetarian and don't normally eat sandwiches. I ordered the "Name your favorite Sesame Street character" sandwich and was very impressed. I was suffering from a migraine and was nauseous, but the sandwich was so good, I finished it all. All in our party were very satisfied with our lunch and my husband plans to return there on his next trip to San Francisco.
glorius.
I love Ikes, OMG!!!!!! they are the best sadwiches I've ever tasted!!
Sad they messed up on our order and we didn't get the dutch crunch like we ordered, so that one cost some points.Besides that, the sandwich was absolutely delicious!!! I heart heart heart sandwiches and Ike's delivered. We got a Manage-a-Trois (because of 7x7) and did not regret it. They throw in caramel apple pops for dessert too :D
YUM!A must visit when in SF. Just expect a line. I recommend "The name of the girl I last dated" -- on dutch crumb bread
Had this bookmarked for a few months. Finally got around to trying it. It was totally worth the 40 min. wait (30 in line & 10 after ordering). Now we know, go before you're hungry!We ordered a Mnage a trios, Hollywood SF & a Paul Reuben to share. All were delicious & unique. My husband & I are eager to try all 200 sandwiches! Now that we know they have a location closer to us in Danville, we plan on starting from the top of the list & work our way down. Best to have any selection on their Dutch Crunch. New Orleans chips, we tried & liked BBQ & VooDoo. Disappointed in the Jalapeno chips, they weren't spicy as advertised. But we do like spicy foods, so it might be just right for the bulk of the nation.Hands down the best sandwich around! This will be our go to place for sandwiches.
Had to try the "kryptonite" sandwich after seeing it on man vs food. It is ginormous and worth the $20. It tastes great and can feed 2 people. Getting parking can be a challenge and you have to eat it elsewhere, but that was not a problem for me. I think it was cash only though. But the food was great, and they have many unique sandwich creations.
First time here, everythings been said already. Just goRecommend the Kryptonite. Well worth the trip from san jo
maaaaaan! this place is good! made sure to to be the first ones in because it gets really busy from what I hear. I get there and yeah i guess we were a little early so it took a while for someone to come and greet us but besides that everything was great...we the menage a trois on dutch crunch and the love triangle on same bread (both similar sammiches with the perfect mix of savory and sweet (from honey mustard and real honey)) and all i can say is wow!! its a flavor explosion perfectly contained by the soft interior yet crunchy exterior of the bread. Cant remember if they had places to eat there but my wife and i went to eat at nearby Dolores park and i would have to say this was one of the best and least expensive meals we had while in SF. cant wait to go back!!! I would recommend this place to anyone that ventures to SF, you wont be disappointed.
Ok my take on this place, 3 stars because the sandwich was really good!! but man 14 bucks for a sandwich c'mon, two sandwiches and a drink was 32 bucks, that's a lil over priced in my opinion, I cant really complain about this place other than the price and be prepared to wait 10-20 min for your order this place usually has a line, witch is good for ike,, making that $$$ lol..
Go order the "BOWSER"!Meatless meatball marinara sub with jalapeno poppers & cheese sticks stacked in the inside!! MmMmM- Long lines- Small storefront- Great EXPENSIVE Subs-Can't really go wrong unless in a rush and on a budget. Two sandwiches with one drink cost me nearly thirty bucks. Ike's is great but pricey, nice to have when indulging in both taste and expense.PS. the captain kirk was pretty tasty. I like the caramel apple pops and free chips but with that kind of price tag the drink should be free! Anyways.........If you haven't already at least go try out Ike's if not in Frisco, hit the new location east bay bound.....Worth the trip as your taste buds will be satisfied.
The food here is amazing, would recommend for avid sandwich fans, i think the SF location is by far the best, they always have enough sauce and its never dry, unlike some of the other locations. They also give a free bag of chips with your sandwiches!!!!
Kitchen sink sandwiches... YES!
Fabulous, simply fabulous. Like Manna from Heaven.
Hi. My name is Lauren S. and I am just your typical unemployed 20 something. Boy if there are two things in this city I like, it's gotta be Bi-rite ice cream and Ike's sandwiches. Let me tell you why.1. I love ice cream. Seriously, I've probably gained 10 lbs this week alone just by eating/sobbing into a lot of ice cream (hey don't ask why, mind your own DAMN BUSINESS). It's not pretty, but it's okay because I still am. Also MK told me it's probably just water weight because I'm about to hit that time of the month when I find out that I'm not pregnant and likely to stay that way. But I digress. My point is if there's one thing I have come to really know well in my 20 something years on earth, it's ice cream, and Bi-Rite is tits as we all know.2. I love sandwiches. The more shit and mayonnaise you can pile on the better, which nobody does better than Ike's. I haven't been here since I turned my back on vegetarianism (which Jillian and Sean M. should probably do, too, because come on guys, you think a cow wouldn't put your ass on a bun if it could get its grubby hooves on you? Yeah, cows do not give a fuck so just return the favor). I'm sure they have good non-vegetarian options as well, which I may try just as soon as I can find an hour of my life to squander while waiting for a goddamn sandwich.Hey since I just mentioned two places in one review I think yelp HQ will be cool with me posting this on two different pages, right? Love ya HQ, never change. Just kilt two birds with one stone, BAM.
The Wait - 1 hour on a Monday afternoon.. I don't even know wanna know what it's like on "busy" day. The Sandwich - Got the Manage-a-Trois - chicken breast, honey, honey mustard, BBQ sauce, pepperjack, swiss and smoked gouda cheese and stuffed extra w/ beer battered onion rings. The first bites in, declared that it was the best sandwich I've ever eaten. It was a pretty magical lunch I must say. Tip - try to NOM your sandwich as soon as possible or else it can get soggy from all the sauce :/ and pick a good place to eat these bad boys because it gets messy!
I was flipping channels Wednesday night and ended up watching Adam Rictchman cruise the SF Area on his show "Man vs. Food". He happened to be at Ike's Place ordering the Kryptonite which seriously was the mother of all sandwiches. It looked like it had every ingredient they had in their shop. Amazing. I decided to check out this hot spot myself yesterday and the website did warn me there tends to be a wait. Sure, no prob.We arrive there and the line is almost to the corner of the block. Holy crap. Was it that good? Well we were going to wait in line to find out for ourselves if they were the best sandwiches in the city.We almost arrived inside to order and I changed my pick about 4-5 times. From the Montana to Rice, to Lizzy Lips, to The Pizzle and finally settled on the Eli Manning on Dutch Crunch, no avocado.After we ordered, we were lucky because a couple tables outside freed up. Then after an hour of waiting in line to order, we waited another 10-15 minutes for our sandwiches to be made. A couple of other folks popped in line and this one guy said he saw the Man vs. Food the night before and was ordering the Kryptonite. We were all chatting about how crazy the line was and the show. Nice crowd.Ike came out and called my name that our sandwiches were ready after a bit. I grabbed the bag from him and my jaw dropped at how heavy 2 sandwiches were. Holy crap, we got some serious sandwiches!My brother got Curtis! which was Halal chicken breast, marinara, provolone while I ordered the Eli Manning made with Halal chicken breast, zesty garlic and herb sauce, mushrooms, cheddar sans avocado. Both covered in dirty sauce and hot out of the oven. All my brother and I could say was: amazing. The sandwich seemed to just get better as we continued to eat. It's crazy! Just the right amount of each ingredients and nothing overpowered the other.Hands down, best sandwich ever. If you're into no meat products, they have a nice selection of vegetarian sandwiches and if you're on a stricter diet (i.e. vegan or gluten free), they have sandwiches for you folks too!I'm so coming back for more!!!
Took a bite of one of their sandwiches.Canceled my prescription for Cialis.
I literally felt like I was the last person on earth who has heard countless reviews about this place but has never even attempted to go to Ike's...but lo and behold, a friend and I decided to have a lunch date one day and I (finally!) picked to check out this place. My friend also hasn't been here either! Phew, glad I wasn't the only one!The sandwich that popped my Ike's cherry was the Matt Cain sandwich on Dutch Crunch..boy it was meaty and saucy! I like. Totally exceeded my expectations. Like many others, I was only able to eat half a sandwich and saved the rest for later. Later, I decided to eat my sandwich for dinner the same day and came to the conclusion that it doesn't taste quite good..practically all the sauce dripped to one end of the sandwich and I was left with a plain tasting, ordinary sandwich at first bite and sauciness at the other end and lost on the thin brown paper they wrap your sandwich in :( It was practically all my fault since I stood it upright in the bag. Lesson learned.Since Ike's does not have seats, take a walk to Dolores Park!! Sit on the grass and enjoy the sunshine while eating your sandwich.All in all, I would definitely go back to this place to try more yummy sandwiches! The sauce is what makes the sandwiches taste delish, but without it, it's pretty meh.
If you like sweeeeeeeet and yuuuuuuuuuuummy food, go yo Ikes place and try 'menage atrios'!!! I cant stop love'm!!
I've heard about it, seen it on food network, etc. and today I FINALLY tried it. I got here early because my friend said it gets packed, so I came early because I HATE long lines. I got there around 11ish and the line was not bad at all. It gave me enough time to look through their extensive and mouth watering menu. It has everything anyone can ask for-BACON, mayo, avocado, meat....LOTS of meat.....My friends and I finally decided to order the Menage Trois with dirty sauce, Matt Cain, and the Hella Fat Bastard. We also had the dirty salt & vinegar chips and the dirty jalapeno chips with stewarts root beer, jones cream soda, and some other rootbeer (starts with a H *shrugs*).While waiting in line, some random guy asked someone behind us why there was a line and we all looked at him like "DUH!" and I can sense he felt stupid for asking that and got in line LOL. service-super friendlyfood-OMFG it was GOOD! The Menage Trois with dirty sauce was so saucy and yummy! I loved how the bbq sauce melted and blended in with the honey, aioli, the herbs, and of course the JUICY chicken. The peppers gave it a nice acidity, the sauces were ughhhh so good!if you like your food saucy, slightly sweet, and savory this is the sandwhich for you.Hella Fat Bastard-EXTRA Mayo......I felt my arteries clog when I read it, but couldn't help but imagine the creamy richness of the mayo in unison with the meat and fried mozzarella sticks. My friend kept going "mmm...mmmm.....yum....mmmm......nom...nom....MMMmmm" while he was eating lol and I did the same when I took a bite of that heavenly sandwhich.Matt Cain-for the non saucy lovers that has a deep appreciation for meat. It was one of the staff's favorite until he turned vegetarian. It was delish!If you have a small appetite, please bring friends that can finish your food for you because it is a crime to waste any bit of Ike's creation! I'm sad that they're getting evicted, but don't fret, they do have other locations like Redwood shores in Redwood City and Stanford (wish they would open one up at Cal).I'll definitely be back before they are gone from the original location.
When I go there, I get "Name of the Girl I'm Dating" with FRIED CHICKEN on Dutch Crunch bread, every time. It is the GOD of all sandwiches. The best sandwich I've ever eaten in my whole life and I'll never eat another sandwich anywhere else. It lives up to the hype, absolutely. I NEVER WANT TO EAT ANYWHERE ELSE.Today as my boyfriend was headed home from work he asked if I wanted Ike's. I screamed YES OH MY GOD YES. HURRY HOME BEFORE I PEE MYSELF I'M SO EXCITED OH MY GOD IKE'S SAMMICH GIMME.It's soooo gooood. Nnnnnnngh. My boyfriend always gets the "Menage a Trois" also with fried chicken on Dutch Crunch. Also insanely yummy.Get a sandwich. Shove it in your mouth. REGRET NOTHING.Oh, AND you get chips, a drink, and a lolli!! :D Yaaay!
great food, great staff, cant stop thinking about the sandwiches. !!!!
Being the #1 review on yelp in SF I thought it would be a much better experience. -Got two sandwich, first one was okay... then I ate the 2nd one couple of hours later and I have to say that it tasted very similar to Subway....-HELLA OVER HYPED!!!
I have ben living in SF my whole life and I have finally been able to try Ike's for the first time! I was really excited but overwhelmed by the amount of sandwiches there are. So, I just ordered a salami sandwich, my favorite deli sandwich. And... I t was pretty good. It was not my favorite, but I enjoyed it enough that I will be back to try another one. I still have not had a sandwich as good as Subs on West Portal, the best sandwich in the city!
I realize there isn't much more to add to the deluge of 5-star reviews at this point, and yet here I am, because I have to tell you how much I LOVED Ike's.I had the Menage a Trois (chicken, honey mustard, honey, bbq sauce, swiss, cheddar) on sourdough. I was full after eating half of it, but then I kept eating because it was so effing delicious.Paired it with root beer and bbq chips, and it was a delight to find a caramel apple pop in the bag! I hadn't had one of those in forever. (My only complaint was that my boyfriend, who ordered one of the giant sandwiches--I think the Lex Luthor--got 2 caramel apple pops because his sandwich was 2-people-sized, but since he just ate it by himself he got 2! UNFAIR CARAMEL APPLE POP DISTRIBUTION! I'm not actually upset about this, just annoyed that I didn't find any clever way to get that second one for myself.)
I love their sandwiches. They have the best BLT ever. Bacon is super crunchy unlike other places where its floppy and gross. def my #1 sandiwch spot.
The best sandwich I have ever had (the Stephan Jenkins). Ike's is delicious, fresh-tasting, and well priced! You get a ton of sandwich also plus a bag of chips. The drinks are good as well. I had the Leninade and it was very tasty! The staff was friendly and worked quickly. You can't really eat in the store however, so be prepared to take your sandwich elsewhere!! They accept cards which is cool, and you get a caramel apple sucker with your sandwich! So legit. I want to return again soon!
They have crazy names for the sandwiches but they all sound delicious! It's a short walk from Dolores Park so def stop by after hanging out in the sun.Food: Get whatever you order on Dutch Crunch. Each sandwich comes with a bag of chips - try the VooDoo chips, never had them before but they were pretty good.Crowd Control: No eating room but there's a park nearby so either take it to go or hang out on the grass and munch down on you food.
This place far exceeded all my expectations- well, food wise (the food is really all that matters though). never really thought a sandwich could taste so good. and it probably should be damn amazing for the price- a little over $10 for a sandwich. i got the menage a trois sandwich and something about the bbq sauce, the bread, the flavor, the entire concoction that was just pure perfection. i wasn't even hungry and i inhaled the thing (god, hate it when i do that). def not your ordinary sandwich and to top it off, each sandwich comes with chips and a lollipop. chips to kill time while u wait for them to make it (took awhile..) and caramel apple lollipop for dessert. they also have really cool sodas i've never seen before. we tried like 3 different sodas while waiting- really tasty!The only bad thing about this place is that there is a lack of parking and no seating. i guess it's good to take out and picnic somewhere. the neighbors probably all hate the swarms of people that come by for ikes so there's so many signs that say DO NOT SIT ON MY THE SIDEWALK AND EAT YOUR SANDWICHES. and notes of that nature to ike's customers. kind of funny. but who cares, the food is really good!
I'm not really one for sandwiches, but this place is AMAZING.
FINALLY! I got to experience the famous hoopla about Ike's and boy I was not disappointed! I got the Thanksgiving sandwich and it was absolutely delicious! Be warned though, these sandwiches are not for people who are afraid of messes. I had used about 10 napkins! I definitely will be back to try more flavors!Word of Advice: Call In. The line gets rediculously long!
Amazing!!! Best healthy sandwiches in SF. Love this place.
Ike's Place is what you call the "American Dream" story...great guy with the vision to make his dream come true. Ike is the sandwich CURATOR of SF and now all over the state of California. We couldn't be more thrilled for his success in the sandwich industry!  Where else are you gonna get mozzarella sticks in your warm & toasty juicy drippin' sandwich. Be prepared to wait in a line around the block most of the time...'cause it's that good! Free chips per sandwich, can't beat that! Ike even has great taste in football teams...we sat next to him at the Rosebowl game cheering for our champion Stanford Cardinal! If you have not tasted Ike's Place yet...what are you waiting for?
Do believe the hype, this place is that good. You are not a true sf yelper unless you've partaken.A bit of an uphill schlep from the otherwise flat mission and worth the chafing your skinny jeans might give you.
This place doesn't need another review for you to know that it is delicious. But let me tell you, they have the best sandwiches I have ever had.That is all.
The Best!!!
Besides the wait time making me dock a star... the sandwich is what kept me at 4 stars... Damn that sandwich is the shit! hahaha Matt Cain was off the chain!! i would just call in advance next time FYI
I have not had a better sandwich anywhere else after having my first sandwich here many moons ago. I remember when Ike's Place was a door you walked up to in a residential neighborhood and you stood there waiting outside for your scrumptious meal. As you may have heard noise complaints were abundant and Ike's relocated a couple times and now has ended up here. My go to sandwich is the Spiffy Tiffy on Dutch Crunch substitute the Halal chicken for fried chicken and all the produce is good for me. I always substitute for friend chicken after a very so helpful worker at the Stanford location recommended it to me. The consistency of quality and taste is what keeps me coming back. All the sandwiches I've tried have been awesome in my book. From the Menage A Trois to the Hot Momma Huda you can't go wrong. I could rave on for days (literally) about this place but I hope I've painted a good enough picture for you to give it a try. They are expanding like crazy with franchises opening up all over the Bay Area. Like I said previously I've been to the Stanford location and also the Redwood City location and they have not let me down. Well actually, the RWC Ike's does have some work that needs to be done but that can be saved for another review.Oh! I almost forgot. At this Ike's location a bag of chips and a Caramel Apple Pop are included with every sandwich. It's the little things that count.
Two words. Super Mario.Amazing!
Uuuggghhhhhhh...f@&$king hipsters!!! Why don't so many of you go away!! All of you are the reason why this place suffers from a severe case of hypery...the worst kind...Hipster hypery...the. same doche hypery that popularized PBR, Tecate, "vintage" anything, heavy outdated bicycles, and over priced average workingmans food ( sandwiches, soups, anything off a roach coach).So with that being said....Ike's delivers a solid $6 sandwich. I mean solid. Problem is I'm forking over $10 and spending 10-30 min of my precious life waiting for the Hipster line in the back to make my sandwich. They no longer have menus to look over while in line, I think this is a good thing. Get the tourists in and out. Churn and burn...This does create an off menu or "secret menu" for the hipsters to talk about at their faux intellectual parties....." Dude have you had the ( insert off menu sandwich here)?... No, dude I've never seen it on the menu...Yea, its kinda off menu I've been going there for years and ordering it, its awesome" douche baggery continues.Anyway the bread is ok, don't let it get cold. The ingredients are average. The dirty sauce is....well ....OK.my friend ordered the 49ers sandwich and couldn't finish it. I think that Ike deserves the accolades for his hard work. The only thing is people rave about how Ike has the best sandiwches in the great foodie city of San Francisco.....which just happens to be suffering from a severe lack of decent (american) sandwich shops.But there are some great Bun Mi shops...although South Bay has us beat...
amazingly ridiculous and out of control sandwiches (jalapeno poppers on a sandwhich? crazy!) backed up with quality ingredients. ive worked in some sandwich shops in my day and think of myself as somewhat of a sandwich connoisseur haha....people like inventive quality ingredients and a plethora of choices and this place has both. definitely no space to eat inside, just order ahead for pick up, and eat it outside somewhere, thats part of the fun (just dont be a jerk and leave your trash on the street which ive seen people do)
Absolutely love these sandwiches. All on dutch crunch. We ordered 3 different sandwiches. Their top 3 from reviews on yelp. Went on a small hike to golden gate bridge and had them sitting in the car for about 2 hours. They were soggy at the time we ate them and I'm still giving them 5 stars. I will definitely come back for these!
Short and sweet... best sandwich I have had the pleasure to eat so far.YUM!
Checked out both the one in the Castro district and the one in SF State. Though I expected the one at state to be overcrowded and lacking in the quality and taste that the main shop does so exquisitely in, I was surprised when my sandwich came out just as unforgettable in both locations.So far I've tried the manage-a-trio, the going home for thanksgiving, and the "insert girl's name here" and have been blown away each time.
I ordered Hollywood's SF Cheesesteak and my dad ordered the Cowboy Curtis both on the Dutch Crunch bread. The bread was fresh and delicious. The sauces on the sandwiches were very yummy. They were really good sandwiches, but for the price I think they could have used more meat. The sandwiches came with a bag of chips. We also got a couple bottled sodas and the total bill was $25 before tax. There aren't any tables, so expect to take your order to go. It's a hole in the wall but the staff was very friendly and helpful. We ate in the car and while we were eating there was a constant flow of business at 4 pm.It's definitely a divey, hole-in-the-wall kind of place. The bathroom has graffiti all over the walls which was interesting to say the least. The staff was very friendly and helpful with deciphering the sandwiches to help us choose.
i'm usually not a huge fan of sandwich shops because I'm more of a burger/fries type of guy & because i'm quite content with going to subway whenever i'm craving a sub. Still, my friends insisted that I try this place since it had been featured on "man vs food." Safe to say, I had very lofty expectations. Locale/atmosphere - not a fan. no seats & it's very dark inside. The kitchen seems bigger than the dining area (or lack thereof .. since there were only a bench along the wall).food - very pricey -- my sandwich (which comes with a bag of chips) cost 12 bucks. The sandwich was excellent -- moist halal chicken with a perfect blend of cheeses and bbq sauce. They're also famed for their "dirty sauce" which is a winner in my book. I've tried several variations of dutch crunch bread and this place makes it perfectly!I would definitely come again if it weren't so expensive.
Straight revolutionary. Lordy lordy lordy was that a damn good reuben. If driving to SF wasn't sort of a pain in the ass i'd go there for lunch right now. gahhhhAnyways it's almost hard to say what makes their sandwiches so good but the breads great and everything is so succulent that it doesn't matter how full you are you will finish the sandwich.Last time I got the "say hey" which is bacon and pastrami and my friend got the reuben and we split them. The reuben was better but the say hey was totally good too.It's def a wait thought, when i was there it was almost empty and my food still took like 15-20 minutesbut it's ow
Anytime you have about 2000 reviews on Yelp is pretty darn amazing and with a 4.5 star average, that is even more so. Luckily I did some research beforehand to understand that I should call in my order because the call in on a Saturday at 5PM warranted a 2 hour wait for a total combined order of 4 sandwiches. I was able to do some lounging around Dolares Park and some nearby dessert eateries while I wait for the notorious dirty sauce on Ike's bunch of sandwich options. You can be quite overwhelmed with their exhaustive list of veggie/meat/vegan sandwiches but I started my Ike's experience with a "Do You Smell What Barack is Cooking?" which is probably more popular than the Ike's moose based sandwich "Do You Smell What Palin is Cooking?" (the latter is a joke so hope some of y'all don't get too excited). The Barack has a nice mix of thinly sliced ribeye, gouda cheese that I couldn't taste very much due to the sheer amount of BBQ sauce and all the standard topping minus the mayo. Very solid sandwich and just the right size for the money.  While it was good, I will have to try a different one the next time I go, maybe something with harvati and halal chicken breast.If Matt Cain, Time Lincecum, and Barry Zito make millions and millions of dollars and come here on a regular basis, what else is not to like?
Ike's Place is amazing. I think their sandwiches are so good because of that special aioli spread they use. I always get the same sandwich because it's perfect, but I'm sure other sandwiches are great too. I always get a large Jim Rome (turkey, cheddar, avocado, sun-dried tomato pesto, aioli) and I add banana peppers. I eat half and then bring half home for dinner. After doing that a few times, my husband got so jealous of my yummy sandwich that I now order him a large Jim Rome too and he eats the whole thing for dinner (sharing some of it with me, of course).
I like to have Ike's at least once a week if I can. It's a constant craving of mine.I've tried a few sandwiches, but my favorite is the menage a trois. I'll eat it anywhere..on the trunk of a car outside of ike's, in my bed so I can have my quiet eating time to savor, when I come home at 2 am tipsy, etc.I stick with the menage, but my vegetarian sister is a fan of the meatless mike sandwich. I also like the Going home for thanksgiving.My advice to avoid the line is to call in before and place the order and pick it up. They are very good at taking large orders over the phone. Only downside about this place is that there's nowhere to sit and eat. Again, trunk of your car will do.
Wow. Mnage-a-trios amazing.Stopped by here when i was cruising the california coast with the girlfriend, because we saw Adam Richmond had stopped by here in one of his man vs food episodes.Found street parking a block down and decided to wait in line for these amazing sandwhiches. We ordered the kryptonite and the menage-a-trois. My favorite was the menage-a-trios just because it was so juicy and succulent, every bite was better than the previous. As for the kryptonite, I was only amazed by the size of it. Also there was happy hour when I was there so i got a free root beer and bag of chips with my order. :)All in all, amazing sandwiches, decent pricing makes this my favorite sandwich shop in SF.Only downside was the LONG LINES and parking. If you're in The area definately stop by, this place is that good.
-Sigh- I know, only four stars. I'm a failure. Where's that stinking fifth star you ask!? I don't know, I just don't have it, I don't know why, I just can't give it up. But be reminded, I don't like sandwiches....There are many sandwiches at this restaurant that sounded interesting. The one that stuck out to me most was The Name of the Girl I'm Dating. It has chicken and avocado and cheese inside and these are three things I really like. I wanted it on Dutch Crunch bread but they were out. This made me disproportionately unhappy. Also, the tip jar says we accept tips and phone numbers. I thought this was funny so I wrote some numbers on a paper and handed it to the guy with my dollar tip. He did not laugh. I felt really awkward. blurgh.The sandwich was up in only 10 minutes. This was really fast when you see how many people are waiting for some sandwich action. I sipped on my water and waited. Since there are no places to sit inside and explicit instructions not to sit on anyone's stoop (duh). SN and I took our sandwich to go. I walked and ate. The juices from the sandwich were all over the place. And it was really good. But oddly enough I couldn't really taste any flavors other than the chicken. It seemed like I had been a little shorted on my other nomnom ingredients. It was still a great sandwich (as far as sandwiches go) but it lost a little of it's luster towards the end. But then it all came back when I grabbed my caramel apple pop out of the bag. Can I get a Hell YEAH! I love those things. What a special treat.I really want to come back and try the Thanksgiving sandwich. And some of the other really exciting sandwiches. And next time I hope I can enjoy the famed Dutch Crunch bread. In the meantime I think I'll hold that last star in my pocket.
I've been to Ike's on two separate occasions and I was not blown away. In fact, I was really disappointed. I think it's quite overrated and overpriced. I can't remember what I ordered the first time but I remember thinking how disappointed I was so I tried something different the second time around. I was equally disappointed. They skimp on the meat so you end up getting a mouth full of bread that is soggy due to the unnecessary amount of sauce they put in every sandwich. It reminded me of a leftover sandwich I had been saving from earlier in the day where all the condiments had been absorbed into the bread.
Ike's Place must make great sandwiches because even the soggy, 2 hour old ones we had were delicious masterpieces.Unfortunately, we couldn't get to the restaurant before closing - which is 7pm nightly ... BOOOOO!! So we had my sister call in our order, pick them up and store them in the fridge until we arrived.Upon arrival we nuked them in the microwave and served it up with some choice French wine. No, not the ideal situation for our meal. But, still absolutely amazing nonetheless.Although the signature crusty bread lost its bounce, but the quality of the meats, the complexity of the sauces and the distinct flavors were still self-evident. If Ike can make the best *soggy* sandwich I've ever had, what more if it were fresh?!
always good sandwiches. the owner actually cam up to our group when we were dining in the restaurant and introduced himself and asked how our meal was
Their sandwiches are delish multiplied-dripping with goodness and hard to get your mouth around.. Plus, they support great local non-profit At the Crossroads, which I just discovered, and that makes them even more amazing than words! Go Ikes!
Finally went to Ike's in SF. What an over-hyped pile of horse manure. Vile tasting deli meat you could buy pre-packaged at Safeway, masked by the taste of some zippy mayo sauce that is thousand island with a sexier name. Got the Matt Cain. Two pieces of cheap Italian dry salami, turkey and some pressed oscar meyer looking roast beef. Just another example of an average place to eat in SF caught up in the hype. If you want a real sandwich, go to Woodside Deli in Redwood City or Genova in Oakland. If you don't want to leave the city go to Lucca or Deli Board. Ike is a poser. Nothing personal Ike.PS: Stop rating this place 4-5 stars just because 7x7 says it good.....please people.
Such a hipster, you are. Been here twice at different times of the day (early noon and late afternoon) and at both times, there were long lines going outside of the store. However, other than the reasons being the orgasmic tasting sandwiches, the cash registers are located at the door. Can you blame em? When you arrive, be sure to grab yourself a menu. The never ending list of sandwiches is hilarious. The names will keep you reading and this may be the most entertained you'll ever be waiting in line. But be sure to get decisive because it will be your turn to order in no time! There's a bar inside with a huge mirror in the back. The atmosphere inside is very trendy, super casual, hip, and cool. Everyone's there for the same reasons- you know, to get their grub on of course.I've tried the famous Menage a Trois sandwich (Yes, it is all that. And yes, you do need to see for yourself) and another time, I've gotten the Hot Mama Huda. Both times I've gotten the dutch bread which goes with everything if you want that crispy, crunchy, but also soft texture that adds dimension to your every bite. I'm all about flavor and texture and the dutch bread does it for me.Biting into the Menage a Trois, I had the perfect full on sandwich experience. It was rich and creamy (honey + honey mustard + bbq), savory (halal chicken), with a nice kick (pepperjack, swiss, cheddar)- all sandwiched between two crunchy and soft pieces of fine dutch bread. I never had honey in my sandwich but the sweetness balanced the pepperjack and bbq so well!Biting into the Hot Mama Huda, I felt like I was eating a sassy hot wing sandwich! This sandwich has a whole lot of KICK. Again, some halal chicken but with franks red hot, cooled down with ranch and provolone. The chicken is always perfect, not dry or too moist. Recommended if you like that big spicy kick in your food.Oh, you also get a bag of kettle chips with every sandwich order. Sandwich and chips, no better combo than that.
The place is super small to go only which is fine. The line was out the door but the food was amazing. My boyfriend had the kryptonite this sandwhich was insane I had a smaller sandwhich #18 on the Dutch crunch best sandwhich in San Fran
Excellent sandwiches and a menu that offers everything from basics to unique combos. The names are fun, too. I can't say I was blown away though. Maybe the incredible reviews elevated my expectations too high. Still, they make a tasty sandwich and I'll be back to try more.
5 STARS, again and again. It's been about 4 years since I've had my first sandwich at Ikes. I'm from orange county, where the food is abundant, but I CRAVE Ike's Sandwiches. I wasn't expecting much this time around because you know how quality seems to always go down now-a-days. Nope, STILL DELICIOUS BEYOND EXPECTATIONS! I had the Pizzle on Dutch Crunch w/ Voodoo chips. Delicious bread, yummy sauce, yummy chips. NOTE: IKE, CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN UP A LOCATION IN ORANGE COUNTY??
That Halal Chicken...
"3 Way" is the best non-italian sandwich I have ever had, hands down! My husband just had the "hot momma" today for the first time and it was fantastic. They are pricey ($8-13), but oh so worth it! To add a bit of added value they give you legit chips, not cheap Lays, and a caramel lollipop. I also appreciate that we can bring the whole gluten-free family and they are just as satisfied by the gluten-free bread offerings. The wait can get super long, there's no parking, and there is no seating, but they succeed despite these annoyances. Places that can pull the whole "you figure it out" thing are so good they know you'll be back like crack addict! I wish they had one in Sacramento!This place is so good it is on the list of three places we are addicted to when we visit SF, especially with friends. Go, you will not be disappointed!
If you've ever had a Philly Cheesesteak from anywhere East of the Mississippi (sic), like Chicago to New York, then this is what you expect when you order one.Really like it, and the staff is friendly.Happy they were able to move to the old Saratoga Chocolates shopfront.
Ike's is good. It was better at the original location. I'm not sure why but it seems like they pay less attention each sandwich now then they used to. I like deli board better.
Finally went to the "original". After countless trips to the RWC location, I had to make my pilgrimage to the SF location to see where it all started.The sandwiches, as expected, were great. They were out of the dutch crunch bread, though, and were also out of ribeye and roast beef. NOOOOO!! It's okay, I basically got the KC Filler'Up BBQ with chicken instead of roast beef, and added onion rings, on french. It was still damn good. Also had half a menage a trois and it did not disappoint.I'll have to give this location 4 stars instead of all 5 that I gave the RWC location, though, because the prices are higher here and it took OVER AN HOUR AND A HALF until I got my food. Even those 30-45 minute waits at RWC felt way short after that. Ike's, please expand to a larger location that can crank out more sandwiches, along with seats or something to eat at! -Sincerely, your biggest fan
I live in San Jose.I come up to SF for Ike's sandwiches, oh and to see my friends too.I CAN NOT go to SF and not leave without one of Ike's sandwiches. There was even a time I bought three. I obviously gained weight from that.Thankfully, there are parks nearby and I just walk it off as much as I can.ALWAYS, I get a Hollywood SF Cheese steak, mushrooms man, the mushrooms.Matt Cain was my first sandwich and will always have a place in my heart and tummy.Spiffy Tiffy - freakin pesto, i can't resist.Backstabber, pretty damn good.I always finish them then and there, but even next day, when i toast it up again, it's still incredibly amazing. Lunch for work, for DAYS.Customer service, Cooks: I'm sure they hear it enough, but thanks for being you and giving me a good time with good food.
What does a chilly day in North Beach match perfectly with? Ike's place...duh. I came here a few years ago and remembered it being good so me and the boy decided that sandwiches sounded good. Pretty long wait during the lunch time hours but well worth it. Don't forget about the full menu online! Good to check out while you wait. I decided on the lincecum on dutch crunch plus the addition of beer battered onion rings. D decided on the doomsday on a dutch crunch roll (expensive ass sandwich fyi...) Order was up in about 15 minutes which was okay since we had chips to munch on and weird people to look at. The place was a bit too crowded to enjoy any meal inside the dinky place so we went in the car like secret obese people. Doomsday was so grossly big that it had to be split into two separate sandwiches...had a taste and it was very good, the 50+ ingredients went well together but the habenero sauce was a little spicy for me. My sandwich was awesome. The sauce they add to every sandwich worked great and made my bread taste more like garlic bread. The sandwich was very similar to a club sandwich and the addition of onion rings was yummy, though I wish they were crunchy to add more texture. All together Ike's place was the perfect meal for our visit to sf.
Simply good
Now that they have raised the prices so high I haven't been back. Sandwiches are still good but not 13 bucks good . Check out Ak subs for amazing inexpensive sandwiches without the wait and they deliver!Ikes is a clear case of taking advantage of a situation. I felt bad for him that the city made them move but since getting so popular BY the people ... its not right that he is sticking it to the peeps that made him famous. Lower your prices back to reasonable ... oh and btw .. start frying your onion rings, poppers and cheese sticks!
One of the best sandwiches Ive ever had. And i love sandwiches.
Accessibility (Parking / Wait Time)1/1 Star: Street parking was easy during my visit, but I can see it being hard to find. There were a lot of people there, but I was able to order my sandwich and get it in less than 10 minutes. _____Service (Waiter / Cleanness / Ambiance)0/1 Star: No eating place what so ever. Signs everywhere that tell you to not eat out side or around the residential area. _____Taste (0=Not Edible / 1=Edible / 2=Good (average) / 3=Must Try!)3/3 Stars: #111 Menage A Trois is a Must Try! This place has really good sandwiches. It was big and tasty. _____Overall Experience4/5 Stars _____Pictures
Customer service was excellent as well as their sandwich. I got the We're Just Friends w/ cranberry sauce. So divine.The hype is real. Going back for some more .
The first time I came to SF I immediately fell in love with the delicious sandwiches at Ike's. Sure, it's gotten a lot busier but the sandwiches are just as good and totally worth the wait.One problem...the hours keep getting cut. I often find I'm looking to get dinner around 7, maybe a little afterwards. But due to their neighbors, who really won't stop bitching until Ike's is out of that location, they're closing hella early to appease the complaints. And as annoying as this is to me personally, it's really Ike's problem because they're probably missing out on a ton of late night sandwich sales. Hopefully Ike and crew can find a new place soon that will welcome a thriving, fun, and delicious business to its community.
Man, my last visit to Ike's was no bueno. I mean, I guess, it was a little bueno cause the sandwiches were flavorful & I gotta see mah boy Ike (holla). I dunno what the deal was but our sandwiches were super soggy... like bread-deteriorating soggy. If this was anyone else writing this review maybe it wouldn't be such a big deal but I dread soggy sandwiches. It is a huge pet peeve of mine. I mean, when I bring a sandwich to work, I pack everything separately & assemble it during my break... that's how much it bugs me.Anyway, I'm guessing this happened cause we called in our order & our food was sitting around for awhile. We called in at 1:00 p.m. & our pick up time was 5:00 p.m.... waiting 4 hours for a soggy sandwich is a major bummer.Since all the other times I've been here have been awesome, Ike's is "A-OK". I still wuv you Ike.
Ok, the sandwich is good but not THAT good! Sandwiches are heavy on material and (secret) sauce, and menu's heavy on chicken!I would call it a local favorite.
I wanted to see what the hype was all about, so hubby and i went here for lunch. the sandwiches are huge and I couldnt finish one by myself. I thought the sandwiches were ok. Perhaps I should try something different on the menu next time.I thought it was cute that they included caramel apple pops with your order!
What a delicious sandwich! They put their sauce on by mistake but it was super tasty. Stuck with me the rest of the day though. Not that they need another review, but this place is really good. Been to several of them.
Love Ike's. There are about a million sandwiches to choose from, so it may take you a while to decide on your perfect sammy... "menage a trois" is a safe bet, I think I can get most people to agree with me on that one. Lines are killer at lunch time - save yourself a few minutes and call in your order!
Looking for a yummy sandwich in the castro/mission then Ike's is the way to go. the only problem is it's take out only so you need to find another spot to eat that thing buddy.
Great sandwiches and the wait wasn't bad even though it was crowded. They were efficient and made a quality sandwich. Also came with free chips!
everything is awesome! Voodoo Kettle Chips!
Ike's is the bombdotcom. I got the Spiffy Tiffy today and it was amazeballs. Definitely my top go-to sandwich there. It has yet to fail me. I think it's because I'm definitely a sauce-lover and that dirty sauce hits the spot! Usually the Spiffy Tiffy has mushrooms but I asked them if they would switch out the mushrooms for artichokes and they did for no extra fee! Love it. The artichokes are not on the menu as a add-on so they need to fix that. I got it on a dutch crunch bun, which I was a little hesitant at getting because I've had many a scraped roof at the top of my mouth with most dutch crunch breads. But this one was nice and soft. And of course, the best place to eat them is at Dolores Park in the bright shining sun with friends. Can't get any better than that. =]
I have only 2 words: Cranberry Sriracha!Those 2 magical words, a lovely combination I never though could exist. Sweet and spicy all in one. How could it be so good? Salt and pepper, you better watch yo backs! Bert and Ernie, you too!Going Home for Thanksgiving - Turkey, harvarti cheese, cranberry sriracha. On wheat bread.Simple sandwich but so perfect. Everything complimented each other so well. The bread wasn't tough or dry. It was the right size. One of the best sandwiches I've ever had.You also get a bag of chips and caramel apple lollipops. Bonus points!Come visit the Castro District and order a sandwich here! Warning: There could be a long line.
Ike's is fucking delicious. They have an extensive vegan menu with a ton of good choices. The iphone app is really easy to use. If you order ahead it's pretty fast. Likey!
Sandwiches are really good. They have some of the most interesting sandwiches there. The only downside to the place is, there is no place to sit down and eat. You have to take your sandwich and eat outside somewhere. Then again, the place is small, so there really is no room to even sit anywhere. They have this one sandwich with turkey and cranberries. Loved it.
Absolute BEST sandwich ever! Any time i am in Northern California i make sure i visit this awesome place at least once. They have something for everyone's taste, even more than what is actually listed on their menu.The "Dutch Crunch" bread is great and their "Dirty Sauce" is to die for.Be prepared to wait in line. Though, it's not because of their service (their staff is friendly and helpful) but because this place definitely attracts a crowd. Don't miss on your next visit to The Bay Area!!!
the creativity! jalepeo poppers on meatball subs! what?!
Did you know Ike's is now open until 10 pm on Friday and Saturday nights? Apparently most people don't, because a couple of friends and I strolled in a little after 8pm last Friday to a shockingly empty Ike's. I was expecting a madhouse, but one I was prepared to tolerate for my first pilgrimage to sandwich Mecca, so I was pleasantly surprised. (It was explained to us that it was only their second weekend with late hours. Their website hasn't even reflected the change, though their Yelp listing has.)Anyway, the best part about the lack of a crowd was that we could take our time in deciding which of the 200+ sandwiches to order. There was no one over shoulders impatiently sighing audibly. Relieved of such pressure, we were able to discuss our options with the fantastically friendly and helpful Aubrey, who was manning the counter that evening. She gave us a rundown of the most popular sandwiches, her personal favorites, and gave us suggestions based on our preferences. Basically we each got a personal sandwich consultation, which resulted in all of us loving what we ordered. (For the record, I got a "We're Just Friends" on Dutch Crunch, with added bacon, so I suggested they name that variant "Friends with Benefits.") Now it may be a fluke to have gotten such personalized service, but the sandwiches themselves were fantastic. I even returned the next day (a Saturday afternoon at near peak hours) and can confirm that sandwiches are just as delicious, but the service was just a little more rushed. I suggest you phone in your order ahead of time if you know what you want; it's like getting a Fast Pass where you get a time to pick up your order, and you can spend some of your wait time doing more valuable things, like, say, getting Bi-Rite ice cream a couple of blocks away.Unless you can time travel back to last Friday evening, I can't guarantee you'll get a leisurely personal sandwich consultation provided by Aubrey, but Ike's sandwiches are nevertheless worth the time and effort.
This place has the best sandwiches I've ever had! The bread is toasted perfectly & they are pretty generous with the meat & toppings. I like how they throw in a free bag of chips with your order. The staff is friendly and they move the line pretty quick. I will definitely make another visit when I'm in SF.
I'm not really a sandwich person, but I love Ike's sandwiches. I've gotten the Vegan Gramps religiously for the past few times I've been to Ike's and never been disappointed with quality or taste. I even got Ike's for my birthday dinner.Unfortunately, I have to downgrade this review from 5 stars to 3 because Ike's is always sending out emails with a coupon: buy one sandwich get another free. I've tried to use these "coupons" multiple times now only to be told, when going in to pick up and pay (always order ahead of time - waiting in line is ridiculous, especially on a nice day!), that the coupon: expired, is only good for a specific date, must be printed and not on my phone, or is not - for some reason or another - able to be redeemed.Seriously, I probably get an email from Ike's Place every two or three months...and I have never once been able to use them. I'm surprised I still even believe they work and try. I think today I learned my lesson - either go to Ike's planning to pay full price (no matter what kind of buy 1 get 1 "deal" I was promised) or don't go there at all.Too bad that a place like that can't own up to it's own offers... I mean, why bother even sending them out?
Don't doubt the power of the secret sauce.
I will be forever loyal to Ike's, but I feel it's a a bit over-hyped and a little over-priced.The menage-a-trois still remains my favorite all-time sandwich, but I'd have to be ballin' or trying to impress a date by shelling out ten bucks for a sammy.Opt to get extra dirty and never look back. It is a quintessential part of the complete Ike's experience.
Got myself the [Name of The Girl I'm Dating] on sourdough and was quite devastated that it was too much for me to finish eating. It was messy and given that I was eating it in a park without a table, napkins were necessary but doesn't take away from the tastiness. I don't remember which sandwich my husband got, but he loved his as well (and was able to eat it all.) Came with chips and a surprise sucker in the bag. The lack of tables caught us a bit unprepared, but we just walked a few blocks to a park and watched some kids attempt to break bones on skateboards while we ate. The sandwich was good enough for a seeing eye dog to say "Screw you, she's got food in her lap!" to his owner. Based on reviews I've heard my choice is a "safe one". And next time I'm able to go to an Ike's (I live in Central Oregon, was visiting SF) I will explore the menu more before ordering. It is definitely a place I will seek out again, when I know there is one in the area.
This is definitely one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten in my life. Starting from the crazy sandwich names on the menu to the friendliest service, you have to eat here before you die. I went here for dinner today with my friend, and I ordered the "Hella fat bastard," which is a sandwich with ham, bacon, mozzarella cheese sticks, and extra dirty sauce. I literally died after the first bite; it was h e a v e n l y. I was full after eating the first half of the sandwich, but I obviously couldn't control myself and downed the whole thing.And the best part is, from Mondays-Fridays, they are having a promo where if you go from 4-7pm, you get free chips and drink with any sandwich. What more can you ask for?? Not only do you get one of the most savory sandwiches in town, but FREE chips and drink! And they also give you a caramel apple lollipop for dessert. This was one of the best meals I've had during my stay up here in NorCal, and I just gotta say, YOU MUST GO.
Their sandwiches are fantastic! The menu is so vast that you won't have a problem finding a sandwich to enjoy (unless you hate bread). If you are a indecisive or picky eater I'd suggest to look at their menu online because it's vast enough of a list that you have to use search filters in order to narrow down what you are desiring.Still I've tried about seven different sandwiches now and I haven't had a terrible one that peaked my interests yet. I only wish this place was more franchised everywhere. It's such a treat to behold.
We all know how legendary this place is. Matt Cain on dutch crunch with bacon is the only way to go. Unless you don't like meat, then Meatless Mike all the way. Now that there are more locations, you no longer have to stand in a 2 hour queue for your sando. This place will forever have a soft spot in my belly, I mean heart.
Definitely lived up to the hype. FOR SURE.Kinda price but SO worth it. I had the MILF (Halal Chicken Breast, Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers, Frank's Hot Sauce and Ranch) with extra dirty sauce and it was DELICIOUS! The people there KNOW THEIR STUFF.. you can ask them anything about the menu and they will tell you! They recommended their most ordered sandwiches, sandwiches that were featured on TV, sandwiches that fit YOUR taste buds. You can tell them what you want and don't want and immediately they will suggest a sandwich for you. We went during Pride weekend and surprisingly, the wait was not that long as I expected. During our wait, we got to meet Ike himself. Very friendly and humble guy. Make sure you get a bunch of napkins because it will get messy. =) I'll definitely make a special trip back to Ike's Place.
One of the best sandwiches I have ever had! Veggie meatball was very tasty; I'll definitely go there again.
Why is Ike's great? Well, if you are even reading this review, I don't know what you are doing, this place has thousands of reviews for a reason: it is the place to go for a sandwich. They have all the options to pleases anyone and everyone in your group. They have imitation meat that is to die for, veganaise, mayonaise, fried chicken, mozzarella sticks, literally everything. You should either read their menu online which now has super awesome features to help you find the perfect sandwich, or simply tell the cashier what you are looking for. Like "I want a spicy imitation meat sandwich." Boom, done.The only problem? It is a little pricy, and there is almost always a line out the door, which means you are likely to wait 45 minutes to an hour between arrival and eating your sandwich. $10 gets you a sandwich with a bag of chips.I am not one to wait, so when I say it is worth the wait. I mean it!
Store policy is the worst and they never seem to have my kids shoe size. Now I have a store credit that I have to use in 30 days. After I use this credit I will never shop at this store again and I will tell everyone I know to stay clear of this place.
I.am.euphoric.
Yes, the wait is long but it's totally worth it!**FYI: So there were a bunch of cameras on the day we went. My friends and I figured that it was because of their popularity. Apparently, they're getting evicted by the end of August?I came here with a couple of friends at around 11am and waited in line for about an hour. The line was pretty long (about 15 people) so make sure you have good company or something to read. The staff are seriously the friendliest people I've ever met! The person who took my order made sure my friends and I had a pleasant experience by explaining what compliments what. He even explained what their "dirty sauce" was to my friends who had never been to Ike's. Grab a bag of chips (comes with each sandwich order) and enjoy other people's company outside.Ike hand delivers the sandwich to you. Major brownie points for that! Buut the best part? The sandwiches of course! I ordered the UnOriginal Turkey Sandwich with dirty sauce, mayo, mustard, lettuce and tomato. I figured if they couldn't make a simple turkey sandwich taste good then I would have to resort to my Little Lucca's. I was not disappointed with Ike's! Will definitely be back!
Sandwiches are always good. Expensive, but everything is in SF. You feel like you are getting your money's worth as well as the sandwich is a far cry from a Subway sandwich (which seems what people are comparing the pricing to in other reviews). Ike has a winning formula and is now popping in his sandwich places all over the place outside of main city. Many vegan options as well, which is a big plus.
Ike's place was one of a few stops on our SF weekend adventure. I had read that the lines are usually super long and that there is no room to eat inside. We were fortunate that our time in line was minimal and we even scored seats for 4 people to eat! The breaded "chicken" is no longer vegan; so vegans beware! The person taking our order let us know and it wasn't a problem at all; we just ordered the vegan turkey. I had the Vegan Tom Brady and my boyfriend had the Vegan Pilgrim. Both were delicious!I would recommend getting any sandwich on the dutch crunch bread. it is amazing! Also. bring some wet wipes for your hands and face as the sandwiches can get pretty messy :)
SF GIANTS= best team, and my personal favorite sandwhich.
This place is unbelievable. I literally flew from Australia just to come here. It was so worth it.
BEST SANDWICH I've ever had!!!!! Nothing compares. I love that it's a mom n pop shop. It feels very cozy. Even the chip bags that come with the sandwich are delicious. Everything about this place is awesome. Always stop by there when in the city.
I think everyone said all there is to say about Ike's. They are humongous delicious messy sandwiches. Some that I like are Mayoose's BLT and Nacho Boy on Dutch Crunch. Order ahead of time to skip the line then take your sandwich and dirty chips to Dolores for a picnic and people watching!
I just don't get it. It took a little over an hour from waiting in line, ordering, and then actually getting our sandwiches from Ike's. Every sandwich is made hot so it does take a little longer to make each one. The place is tiny; it's about the size of gas station bathroom. The people taking orders were super-friendly and gave us some helpful tips on what to order since the wife is a vegetarian. Maybe all the stellar yelp reviews raised our expectations beyond reason...but we got the veggie 16th and Market (vegan chicken, veggie bacon, avocado and jack cheese) and the veggie Fat Bastard (vegan turkey, veggie bacon, double dirty sauce and american cheese) and noticed the sandwiches were kinda skimpy. Both of us thought the sandwiches were just okay but not the eye-ball popping taste explosion we kinda expected. And just a heads up, they don't serve their famous fries on the weekend...Maybe we caught Ike's on a bad day, but it seems like this place has become kind of a tourist trap...
Great vegan sandwhiches.
As if this place needs more reviews! Mayoose's CA-BLT was delicious (I added chicken) and Ike and the staff were as friendly as can be.
Delicious! Tasty little place for lunch to hold you over for the day! Been going here for years! Never disappointments!
I'm so sad about this place! I really wanted to love you guys, but I can't. :(I was so excited to come here after hearing about this place from the news and from friends. No long wait in line for this place, so I quickly ordered. I ordered the SF Giants sandwich, which isn't listed on their short menu in store. (Take a look at the menu online and you'll have many more choices to choose from.) Teammate got the sandwich that was named after a host of KGO? The service was nice and friendly plus you get a free bag of chips! (Who doesn't like free stuff?)The sandwiches are cut neatly in half for you to enjoy. I ate the first half of my sandwich, it tasted pretty good. On to the second half. I took the first bite, still good, and then I went in for my second bite, I found a hair. A HAIR!!!! I dropped the rest of the sandwich onto the butcher paper and I was done, the rest of the sandwich along with the hair went into the garbage. What a sad day, I'm sorry Ike's. :(
Ike's Place is this crazy sandwich place with a menu that can make some laugh and others blush! It was packed with Berkeley students when I went, but the cashier was super friendly and patient. She asked if it was our first time and offered helpful recommendations. If you actually check out their menu on their website (ilikeikesplace.com/menu), you can order off-the-menu sandwiches. MENAGE A TROIS: I ordered the "Menage a Trois" on Dutch Crunch bread, one of their most popular sandwiches. It had halal chicken, real honey, honey mustard, BBQ sauce, pepper jack, swiss, and cheddar. Delicious! It was a little too sweet and very messy (juices were dripping everywhere!), but it was so good. I really loved the Dutch Crunch bread. It had a crunchy crust but was soft and chewy inside.WE'RE JUST FRIENDS: My friend got the "We're Just Friends" also on Dutch Crunch. It had halal chicken, orange glaze, avocado, and pepper jack. It tasted really similar to mine, but with avocado. It was sweet, but not as sweet as the Menage and it definitely wasn't as messy. Both sandwiches were really good. I slightly prefer the "We're Just Friends" just cause it didn't leave my hands covered in BBQ juices.Ike's Place has been added to my list of favorite sandwich places! I wish we had one in the LA area! Just a word to the wise, Ike's doesn't have tables inside - just an area for waiting - we went to a nearby park and had a picnic.
There's no words. I've been coming here for years but just getting around to writing a review. THE BEST vegan/vegetarian meal in San Francisco. The Jessica Rabbit is literally heaven in sandwich form; super bummed I can't eat it now that I'm vegan (hint, hint, Ike). I wish the vegan sandwiches had a little more insane toppings like the vegetarian/meat ones do, but they are still ridiculously good. My only complaint (yes, my ONLY complaint) is the lack of seating. But on a nice day nothing beats an Ike's sandwich at Dolores park.Come here. Get the Jessica Rabbit. Seriously.
ahhh Ike's. From its tiny rats hole on 16th, to its bigger dirty hole at Lime, to a more normal-sized establishment back on 16th. what is there to say that hasn't already been said? Nothing, I guess. Except that I'm more on the team who says that Ike's is a bit overrated. yeah, I said it. Are the sandwiches tasty? Yes.-i'm not refuting this fact. But how hard is it to make a good sandwich? And i'm not talking about the cutty corner liquor store by your house. I do agree that the sandwiches are good. But for how expensive they are and the quality of the ingredients at that price...eh. If it were two years ago, i would have given Ike's one less star because waiting in line is like dying a slow death. I guess this has sort of been remedied by their change of location. hence the 3, instead of 2, stars. All i'm saying is, lower the prices and give me some better ingredients. I had an $11 sandwich yesterday that could have easily been $7. ELEVEN DOLLARS! What has society come to!? Highway robbery, if you ask me. have we forgotten: THIS IS A RECESSION. And this is San Francisco, California, Damnit.. There is a farmers market 2 blocks from 16th every Wednesday on Noe. Give me that fresher, less expensive business.
This is not a good place for my diet. Its habit forming. I think the sandwich chefs were previous crack dealers. Simply, they know what it takes to make you happy and keep you coming back for more ....more.... more.Warning - this is not a good place for a diet. Its a hella great place to eat.p.s. tables outside would be a must have addition. Hope you can swing it with the City
Hella Gooooood
Best Sandwich I've ever had. Definitely coming back!
This place is good. I think it's a little overhyped from all the TV stuff. But it's good.I really do like the diversity of all the sandwiches. If you want a sandwich with halal chicken, mozzarella sticks, honey mustard and god knows what else, chances are this place has that sort of a combo.It is rather expensive for a sandwich and the lines/waits are long. But if I'm nearby I'd stop by. It's worth it to make a pilgrimage over and try it once and see for yourself. I work right near The Sentinel and live near Roxie so they seem to get more of my business.The neighborhood is pretty sensitive to any jerks who eat outside and drop food on the ground or loiter. So unfortunately nobody can eat outside, and you have to eat it in your car or take it somewhere. The inconveniences are, well, an inconvenience for sure, but like I said, stop by at least once and check it out for yourself.
Is it necessary to write another review for Ike's?It's a sandwich spot and it's rated the top restaurant in SF with close to 1000 reviews. It ranks higher than Gary Danko and the Dining Room at The Ritz Carlton. It's gotta be good right? Yes. Yes it was good.What more can I say that you would care to read about???Oh yeah, the guy at the register looked like Emile Hirsch. I don't think that was ever mentioned in any other review.
This place is actually unreal. Best sandwich in the peninsula
I normally won't review a place if I agree with the overwhelming majority of Yelpers, but this place was so amazing I can't not review. The menu was loaded with so many great choices, I bet you could eat a different one every day for a month, cycle back every month for a year, and still never get tired of this place.Menage a Trois (named for its use of 3 sauces and 3 cheeses) on Dutch Crunch, extra dirty with mozzarella sticks, can absolutely live up to the hype of an orgasm of flavor. Yeah, "orgasmic" is cliche, but this one's pretty darn hard to argue. It doesn't look all that special, but have a taste and you may never be monogamous again (except with Ike's as your single sammich hookup).
Second time around and now I'm addicted to this place.SF Giants (without cheese) is my new favorite. So you're paying $10 for a sandwich, but it's worth it.GO GIANTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Absolutely DELICIOUS sandwiches here. Get the [Name of the Girl I'm Dating] on a dutch crunch. Just do it. :) Halal chicken + honey mustard + tomatoes = nomnomnom goodness. Keep in mind there are extras you can add in like banana peppers, jalapenos, etc. :]And try to avoid the lunch rush if you can! Dropped by at 11:15 AM today on a Sunday, and didn't have more than a two minute wait to order, and then 10-15 minute wait for my sandwich. Also--if this is your first time to Ike's, keep in mind there isn't really anywhere to sit and dine. If you're on your own or in a small group, I would recommend considering dropping by one of the nearby cafes like Cafe Church, patroning them by getting a drink from them, and then sitting down to eat your sandwich there. Support more small businesses...and have a nice comfy chair to sit while you chow down on your Ike's. nomnom.
Quality. This place in tha shit!
Epic epic epic!!! Lex Luther is absolutely amazing. make sure u pick the right time to go, I was there and it was empty and it still took 15 mins to make our food. It's possibly the greatest sandwich iv ever tasted. Mine had chicken fried steak, chicken fried chicken, mozzarella sticks, French dressing lettuce,tomato american cheese and thinly sliced rib eye. You get a bag of chips and a caramel apple lolly thrown in aswell. Go early and make sure u are starving!!!Ike is simply genius
Ike's is good. They have a wide range of interesting and delicious sandwiches. The staff is friendly, once you finally get to talk to them. The bread is good and the other ingredients seem very fresh. Everything should be fresh considering the volume this place sells in a day. While I like Ike's I think it is over-hyped, but then again San Francisco does seem to love it's trendy food crazes.There are a few things you should be aware of: They are not cheap.The tend to be heavy on the sauce.The wait is terrible regardless of when you go.There is nowhere to sit and eat your sandwich.Most of the sandwiches are not good cold or reheated.
how can this place have anything less than 5 stars?! THANK YOU YELPERS FOR INTRODUCING ME TO THIS DELECTABLY, HEAVENLY, ORGASMICALLY SANDWICH SHOP!I don't care what I'm doing when I'm in SF, but I always have to drop by this place. Yes the wait is long, but what do you expect when you're standing in front of heaven's gate waiting to order the best dang sandwich that your taste buds will ever melt over! I suggest that you research your choices online first because they have over 100 different sandwich options. I also recommend you order whatever sandwich on DUTCHCRUNCH bread. You can thank me now for it. :) IKE PLEASE OPEN A SHOP IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA!!! PUHHHHHHHHHHHH-LEEEEEEEEEEEASE!
Ike's has a lot of vegan and vegetarian sandwiches! Yay!!! I've tried a couple and I know I am going back to try more.... Of the two that I tried, I liked Mike's meatless meatball s/w. I chose the sourdough bread to go w/ this delicious s/w.
Love the sandwiches here!
Bomb; the word I would use if I had to sum it all up in one word. The sheer amount of choices you get to customize a sandwich puts all other places to shame. Had a fully loaded steak sandwich for breakfast and man I just wanted to head back for another one for lunch.The bread was perfectly moist on the inside and the crust had a perfect crunch to it leading your taste buds to a glorious torrent of flavors in the middle.
On Saturday, I had the pleasure of eating "change" on french bread. It was complete with rib eye, cheddar, onion rings, bbq sauce, dirty sauce, and pesto. What a messy glob of tasty, saucy, goodness. The mixture of sauces was absolutely savory, sweet, and perfect.How good was my sandwich?Good enough that I licked the paper holding the sandwich together clean. Yes, I did indeed lick all the sauce and goodness off.No shame.
Jaymee Sirewich - bombest sandwich ever made. Going home with cream cheese also danky
Always a favorite, food is delicious! best sammies hands down!
Me and my boyfriend decided to take a walk and explore the city. We got off the bus and saw a very long line to a small food joint. We asked what is this line for? The guy out front said its where you will the eat the best sandwhich of your life. Since he was a local we trusted him. Once we finally got inside we saw all the awards on the wall. We were like ok this has got to be good. And YES! it was the best sandwhich I ever had. We decided to split the "Lincecum" on the crunch bread. The combo of the bread and "dirty sauce" was phenomenal! And once they found out we were from SoCal they told us we are in luck. They are opening one in the Los Angeles area. I'm gonna go to the grand opening for sure!
Great Big Sandwiches With Awesome Sauces
Eh, it's ok. Pretty good. But not worth all the hype. Mr. Pickles has a better sandwich with way less waiting and/or hipster attitude.
Excellent excellent excellent. Finally a great sandwich place that doesn't just cater to carnivores but veggies and vegans as well. BOMB food and can't wait to return
Is there even a point writing a review with this place having 4880 reviews and still maintaining a 4.5 score? Don't think so. I was skeptical about a sanwich place being so amazing. But...when you take that first look at your sandwich...you just know. I got the Hot Mama Huda with fried chicken (now called Ms. R)...and it was mind blowing. The deliciousness of the sauces with with quality of my sourdough bread and the fried chicken was just incredible. Try it. I don't know when yet, but I'm going to come back. Many times.
I won't bother repeating what everyone else has said about their amazing sandwiches, but I will tell you this: It's all true.This place is on its way to SF landmark status...within five years tourist checklists will look something like this:1. Coit Tower2. Fisherman's Wharf3. Golden Gate Bridge4. Ike's Place'Nuff said.
"WHERE THE FUCK IS MY AVOCADO?" is what I said to myself the last time I ordered a sandwich from here. It was supposed to be on there.But I'll stop reminiscing about the one bad experience I had. Why 5 stars? It's simple. I follow a vegan diet, and happen to fare better on a gluten free diet (note: for you self professed fatties, going gluten free can put a nice dent in that calorie count). Okay, because of my diet, I'm a freak basically, right? You're probably thinking what the hell does this have to do with the review? Well, try following my diet for a week. You will probably die. Somehow I've managed to keep it together, and my gf thinks I'm pretty ripped/muscular (albeit thin) so I must be doing something right. Ike's is one of those restaurants that help me keep it together. For those of you who can't make the connection, it's because they have vegan options, as well as gluten free bread. And for you vegans out there who know the deal, it's not just shit sandwiches where they just pluck the meat out and leave you with the condiments (ahem, subway). Someone actually thought of us when designing the menu. 6 stars if I could for that point alone.Show Ike's some love and go if you haven't already. But make sure they got the avo on your sandwich before you walk off and decide to have your sandwich at a place where you can't curse anyone out for forgetting to put something on the sandwich. Oh, and call ahead to place your order cuz they get busy.
yay free chips and a lollipop~ i got the pilgrim, a vegetarian sandwich that includes cranberry sauce and sriracha. by far the most unique and delicious sandwich place ive been to.
Mnage Trois, why did it take me so long to find you? You have spoiled other sandwich places for me, but I forgive you.
Finally was able to hit this spot while spending the day in the city. We called ahead about an hour before in order to avoid any potential lines. Surprisingly, when we arrived it was fairly quiet and we were able to get our sandwiches quickly.We drove over to the Palace of Fine Arts for a nice view and were eager to eat our sandwiches. We were too hungry so we munched on our chips on the drive over. I had to say..excellent chips!Grabbed a bench and excitedly unwrapped our sandwiches to devour. We got the Damon Bruce and the Spiffy TIffy in order to try two different tastes. First impression was that the sandwiches did look fairly small..less than a foot long. However, with the 1st and each bite after that, the freshness of the ingredients plus the great balance of sauce and bread really added to an amazing sandwich. Both were excellent in their own way and were definitely the best sandwiches I've possibly eaten.So why -1 star. PRICE. It is tough to pay over 30$ for two sandwiches and 2 drinks. It made it less painful that it was definitely delicious but for the amount you get and the fact its a SANDWICH still doesnt justify the price.Also, staff didnt tell me that the drink i bought needed a bottle opener! I couldnt even open the drink during my meal and actually..its still sitting in my fridge. Lame.
Ike's is awesome! We have been to just about every sandwich shop here in Monterey and Ike's is hands down our favorite! They give you free chips with each sub as well as a free lollypop! Fun place, full of lively staff and customers! Definitely a must while in Monterey! I will give them 4 stars instead of 5, just because you will wait a fair amount of time for your order...to be fair, it is wicked busy! GO! GO! GO! Worth the wait!
Solid sandwiches that tend toward the heavy side... perfect if you've got a big appetite. I actually tried the 'kryptonite' once-- avocado, bacon, beer battered onion rings, corned beef, extra pepper jack, ham, mozzarella sticks, pastrami, pesto, roast beef, salami, stuffed jalapeno poppers, turkey all on one sandwich-- but I usually just get the eggplant sandwich. Lately, I prefer lighter fare such as Estella's, but Ike's is as good as its reputation suggests.
Best sandwich I have ever had, anywhere. Worth the 30 minute wait for food. The Minaj et Trois is a very prime choice.
I cannot say enough about how much I love Ikes. My favorite no doubt the SF cheesesteak. Great selection of bottle sodas.
Love this place, only issue is that the Oakland shop can take a long time to make your sandwich. I use the app to order ahead of time and it works perfectly!
I go with the Curtis most every time: Halal Chicken, marinara sauce, and provolone cheese. I choose a wheat roll with lettuce & tomatoes, and the awesome house sauce too of course. Yum!
I can see the appeal, but for me the sandwiches here are ridiculously overpriced for their very small size, and they're just not that much tastier or more unusual than a regular deli or sandwich place. Definitely a step up over Subway or Quizno's, but still not getting a third star from me.
I'm from Los Angeles. If I had the time and money, I would drive up to SF just for Ike's.Hands down, the best sandwich I have ever had. Nacho boy and mnage  trois are the best sandwiches here.At first, you don't realize what makes the sandwich so good, it has to be the dirty sauce. Not only is the sauce good, but the overall sandwich is just a great combination of different flavors.I hear Ike's also does a Dodger's tax. I would proudly wear my Dodger's gear and get taxed because that won't stop me from getting delicious Ike's!
I can't believe I've lived in the city for years and just found out about this place two weeks ago. Well, since then I've been a couple of times and had the delicious privilege of eating a) The Tim Lincecum b) The infamous Kryptonite and finally c) The Mnage  trois.-Lincecum--By far my favorite. I could taste every single ingredient in the sandwich. Havarati, in my opinion, makes the sandwich. -Kyrptonite- Why would I not eat something that was featured on Man vs. Food. Because there's so many different meats in this sandwich, I was hoping to taste most of them. Unfortunately, everything blended into one flavor. Still legit, don't get me wrong, but for me it didn't really live up to the hype. -Mnage  trois--Decent. It's great for anyone that loves a saucy flavor to their sandwich. Overall, I'm a fan. Can't wait to go back and try the other delicious options on the menu.
"I want to devour a Matt Cain" I proudly declared."Oh lucky Matt," said the guy behind me in line ( a long line that went pretty quick btw)Yep, it was too funny. At least I didn't order the 'menage-a-trois with extra meat please' which my flamboyant gay friend emphatically ordered the last time we lunched here.Matt Cain SANDWICH is made with roast beef, turkey, salami, godfather sauce, provolone and getting it on dutch crunch makes for yelp#4074 almost useless but maybe helpful?Ike's has gone up over the past couple years so your former $8 is now $10 - unless you live near Stanford campus.. prices are more palatable to cater to the students there and those of us in the know who live close enough to know.
I love Ike's!!!A friend recommended it and I will never give it up. Avoid the long wait and order by phone! Extended menu online is helpful and very descriptive. My all time fav is the Lincecum sandwich!!!
If you haven't had Ike's, you're not a foodie.Stop being lazy.Eat Ike's.
After all the hype about this spot, finally I get to try this place out. The first few attempts were all a FAIL! Either the line was crazy long, wrapping down the street & around the corner or they were closed (@7PM on the weekdays). Even when you think calling in your order for pickup is the fastest solution, it's not. The window of time is so long...ie call in @11am & your sandwich isn't available until after 3pm.So, I did what any anxiously curious person would do...took a day off & went first thing as they opened up shop! To my surprise, as early as it was for a sandwich on a week day, we weren't the only patrons. All I thought was Damn, these sandwiches must be that good. After my first bite, I knew that it was.... pure DEE-LISH-IOUSS-NESS!!These weren't just "sandwiches", these were "THE BEST SANDWICHES IN THE WORLD"...and this is exactly why:(1) They were huge!! They certainly don't skimp on the meat, veggies, and/or cheese that goes into the sandwich. (2) They were oooey gooey goodness MESSY!! Haha, I used more than 5 napkins and my white shirt is now not so white. LOL(3) Extensive, not to mention clever, sandwich list. With names such as "menage a trois" and "some girl i was dating", how could you not be curious? (3) There's something about that special dirty sauce that just seals-the-deal in goodness!So, bottom line: was it worth the long line or getting there "when they open" early? YES!!! And there's no doubt about it, it is THAT GOOD!
This place has the best sandwiches in San Francisco. No holds barred. Every time I come here, I try something new. Just make sure you order before hand, else the wait is terrible. Use the mobile app, it lets you set a pick up time as well. Once you get the sandwich, just walk over to Dolores Park (3 blocks away) and enjoy your meal in the park! Very friendly service. Very long lines. Worth every minute!
Ike's is back! They make really good sandwiches with fresh ingredients. I only advise you to eat it right away because the sandwich will get soggy if you wait too long and the lettuce wilts. And I love the caramel apple lollipop in every bag.
Ikes to me is like Space Mountain at Disneyland.Definitely one of the most popular attractions. Difficult to miss and your SF eating experience will seriously be lacking if you decide to skip it.Long lines are almost always guaranteed..and even though you think you are close...you still have to wait more.Yes their version of "fast pass" is phone orders but its not what you think. They actually assign you a time to come in. So if phone orders are backed up, then you have to wait longer too.Tricky tricky....I recommend checking out their menu online because its seems like its more extensive (i.e. I didn't even see the sandwich Adam Richmond from Man vs. Food ate on the menu but its listed online).For all sandwiches you get to choose the following:TYPE OF BREAD: Dutch crunch, sourdough, wheat, frenchVEGGIES: Lettuce, tomato, red onions, pickles, banana peppers, jalapenosCHIPS: Funky, Salt&Vinegar,sea salt, jalapenoI like the huge variety of sandwiches (including veggie options for dieters/vegetarians). I wish it were cheaper though.P.S. Thanks Ike's for throwing in caramel apple lollipops at the bottom of my bag!
Me: Hi, is there anything spicier than the Hot Momma Huda?Cashier: Sure, we can put Sriracha or habanero sauce on it.Me: Sure, I'll take the habanero sauce, on a Dutch crunch roll with no onions please.My friend: No Sriracha?Me: Fine! Can you add Sriracha too?[time elapses]Kitchen: ...hot sauce?! Whoo!!! *applause*After several well wishes and condolences from onlookers and the guy who handed us our sandwiches, I began to get a little nervous, as I had finished all but two gulps of my soda - before I even started to eat my sandwich. The three hot sauces didn't make me break a sweat, but the sandwich dripped with goodness, and I'd definitely recommend anyone who orders that sandwich to request the extra heat. I couldn't think of why anyone might wait, but the sandwiches get soggy easily, so the sooner you could take them out of the bag and inhale them, the better.The employees were personable and had a sense of humor. We went around 3PM so the wait in line wasn't half bad. I didn't see the laminated spiral bound menu they had next to the register, but I'll be sure to check that out next time. Alas, I can say I've become a fan of Ike's, just like the rest of you.
Great sandwiches and definitely a lot of variety. I had to give it two chances because the first time i wasn't wowed, but i must've been in a bad mood or something, because the second time i fell in love. Definitely a must go spot
Finally stopped by Ike's' newest Location of the Month, drawn by the siren song of Scoutmob & the free Ugly Owl. Ordering by phone is an awesome option, but I wasn't prepared to wield the patience of a saint. I was hung up on once after being put on hold for 5 mins, then put on hold again for an uncomfortably long time on the 2nd try before a cacophony of static, background noise, and HUH? WHAT? finally resulted in me placing my order successfully. Keep in mind, the whole time I'm trying to get on and off the 101 and drive across town while not running over self-righteous jaywalking hipsters. Suggestion, Ike & co.: Please consider quarantining someone in a quiet room to strictly take phone orders during peak hours.Bottom line: Still worth it to devour my mini-Ugly Owl & Paul Reubens. (Over a 6-hour stretch, don't worry, Mom). Currently harboring resentment toward my trash can for getting to savor the aroma of the Dirty Sauce drippings left in my wrappers.
I had the Jerry's Great and my friend had the Kryptonite. All I can say is WOW!We didnt finish our sandwiches and werent hungry till the next day!Totally worth the wait and eating on the sidewalk. Amazing sandwiches!
If you're gonna spend $13 on a sandwich, it better be the DAMON BRUCE on dutch crunch!It's just a really a good combination a light BBQ taste, zesty "dirty" sauce, and thin/not fatty steak. If you want something of a lighter fair, try the SF GIANTS which if filled with turkey!but since most of Ike's sandwiches contain similar sauces, one can easily grow tried of Ike's because everything starts to taste the same after multiple visits! (and yes, I am guilty of visiting more than once or twice, or 4+ times.)so when reading their extensive menu, choose your sandwiches wisely :)
I love their meatball sandwiches the most. Super Mario, Super Luigi... both SO GOOD. Chicken is pretty decent too, but it pales in comparison. I love Ike's, but I still say it's kind of pricey. The people who work there are really really really nice though, so I guess it's all good. I think they also raised prices, but now offer a complementary bag of Dirty Chips.I would go back again and again and again. Call in for a pick up order if you're smart and take your sandwich to Dolores Park to eat.
Ike's is pretty good. I like the huge variety in terms of sandwiches. I got the Love Triangle, and the sauce was delicious although I was not a fan of the faux meat. However, the sandwiches are on the pricey side ($10), and the line is insane. I don't think the sandwiches are so good to merit that hype. Then again, I have not tried The Kryptonite, which according to my friend is the best sandwich he has ever had. I will come back again and see!
Like Ike needs more praise or publicity, what can I say other than, this Place is AMAZING.The Dutch Crunch rolls melt in your mouth and the dirty sauce makes my mouth feel naughty (in a good way?).You can drop anywhere from $8-20 for a sandwich though! Average is around $10 or $11 and you get a bag of Dirty Chips brand kettle chips (your choice) and a Caramel Apple Pop in your bag. The whole idea is kind of nostalgic, like when your mom packed your lunch in a brown bag... but on steroids (not literally). Plus, the quality and quantity of the sammiches alone are worth the money.If you're stopping in the City for lunch, grab some Ike's, you won't be disappointed but be prepared to wait if it's feeding hours.
Great sandwiches, really loved the Dutch Crunch bread. Ordered the Spiffy Tiffy sandwich.
The best place in San Francisco to get into a Love Triangle!
Okay, I'll go sit over here on the "meh" bench with a couple of the other folks. After seeing Ike's Place on "Man Vs. Food" and checking out the website (Gadgety and cool! SOOPER SEEKRIT SANDWICHES!), we were pretty pumped to try Ike's Place on our way to a long weekend in Napa and Sonoma. I had the Backstabber (halal chicken, marinated artichoke hearts, caesar, provolone) and Husband Man had the Elvis Keith (halal chicken, teriyaki, wasabi mayo, swiss). While the sandwiches were serviceable -- the bread was delicious -- they really weren't anything *that* special. And it may have been our choice of sandwiches, but honestly I've had Firehouse Subs or Schlotzky's sandwiches that are more flavorful. The place was crowded, but not line-out-the-door crowded. We waited about 15 minutes for our sandwiches and had to keep doing the "move around" dance so we weren't in the way of the people getting their chips... or their drinks... or their pick-up orders... or coming in the door. The flow could use some improvement. So, I'm glad we gave it a whirl (and if we didn't live on the opposite coast we'd probably try it again), but we weren't that impressed. Sorry, Ike!
***Good***Amazing selection. Amazing sandwiches.***Bad***Can take an eternity to get a sandwich. Wildly unhealthy.***Recommendation***The "Eli Manning"
Went here during a SF trip with some friends. Parking, as expected (it's SF), was horrible and we ended parking about 5 blocks away. There was a line out the door but it moved fast. Sandwich was pretty good. Huge. I was only able to finish half. But definitely get the Dutch Crunch bread! And it came with chips and a lollipop. Gotta love it!
This place was amazing. So much to choose from I got pushed into throwing something out there and ended up with a bbq chicken sandwhich. Seems simple but it was amazing.
I love sandwiches. Ike's Place has such a great selection of sandwiches that it would take me forever to decide on what I want. I don't even really know what to say about the sandwiches besides that I really enjoyed the sandwiches both times that I have been there. I remember ordering the Matt Cain, which comes with godfather sauce, provolone, turkey, salami, roast beef.  The other time, I think I ordered the SF Giants, which comes with mushrooms, avocado, swiss, turkey, bacon. Both times, it was fantastic. Next time, I will probably end up the Lincecum just to keep the Giants theme going. There isn't really THAT variety you can put into sandwich-making but Ike's Place has a pretty extensive menu.All sandwich orders come with your choice of a bag of chips and a caramel apple pop. To me, my mine focus is the sandwich anyways so it wasn't really a big deal. I'm ready to head back though.
Where can I start? I literally have no words for this place. I was a bit skeptical trying a place with such crazy sandwiches, buy boy was my mind changed. It was a great place to get lunch after a few hours at Golden Gate Park. I split a nacho boy with my brother's girlfriend and, I have to admit I am not really a mushroom person, but they were hardly noticeable. It tasted like nothing i had eaten before, so much flavor! And the Dutch crunch was TO DIE FOR, the best bread I have ever tasted, ever. And I love the simple store layout. I do recommend calling ahead since it's a pretty popular place. And the sodas and lemonades are very gourmet and tasty! Also the chips they have are great too! When I am back in NorCal, this will be the first eatery I hit up.
dutch crunch!
The BEST subs in the city, hands down. I waited in line for 20 minutes and I'd wait in line for 45 minutes if I have to.
Crowded spot like all the time! The sandwhiches are alright, not the best thing I have ever put in my mouth but it was satisfying. I got the tiffy spiffy, it was alittle bland and the bread got soggy fast because I didnt eat it right away. I wouldn't go out of my way to.come here again but if I was passing by I would def grab something togo. Service was okay, nothing to tip over, they took my order and that was it, pretty average. For all you ike lovers out there..I say to you....big freakin deal, the sandwhiches are over rated. C
Ike's Place is simply the one the best if not the best sandwich shop in town. I recently enjoyed the Spiffy Iffy ($10) on Dutch crunch light dirty sauce (a mayo based house sauce) and marveled in it's greatness. For one thing, it's huge, massive, colossal. That and the quality make you immediately forget you spent $10 and answers the question of whether Ike's is overhyped. What amazed me is that for how big it was -- jammed back with plenty of goodness -- the sammie never fell apart when I bought into. Perfect design meets perfect taste. A few notes: Expect a healthy wait time for your Sammie and remember goodness is worth waiting for. Also, Ike's is to go only. No seating period but Ike's lists a number of great places to eat -- a nice touch. Thanks Ike's. Keep up the good work!
Been here once, after seeing high star reviews on Yelp. The sandwiches are pretty awesome, portions are large, and seriously delicious.Wasn't offered a lollipop as mentioned in many reviews. Perhaps it's necessary to ask for it?I'm not even sure what sandwich I order, but I did get their signature bread. Like I said, the sandwich was a fantasticly delicious chew. But in the end, it was just a sandwich. But yay, I'm a fan.
Screw subway's healthy subs, I'd eat any of Ike's sandwiches any day!!My friend and I decided to come here since that Man vs. Food guy came here.. And it was such a smart decision. We came on sunny Sunday afternoon, around 3PM and the line wasn't as bad as people said it would be. Give the people some credit for running the place with 2 girls working the register and everyone else making sandwiches..I ordered the Super Luigi. OMGaahh it was amazing! Meatballs, jalapeno poppers, dirty sauce, marinara, and I added lettuce so I could tell myself its kinda healthy.. Hearing all of that should make your mouth water.. Mmmm.The spot is kinda expensive, sandwich + rootbeer = $14. No french fries in the weekend.. whomps.. And they have very limited seating.. If you don't want to wait in line - order ahead. Their menu is online, you've been warned.OH! and the owner of this place is super nice.. And cute.. topped off my star rating!!!
So many option to choice from. You cant go wrong with any of the many sandwichs there
I lied. Right there on my profile. I said my 3075th review of Ike's would make a difference. In fact, this will be review #3800 for Ike's. I feel so much better for coming clean about that. The new space seems much better equipped to handle the hordes of people that make the trip to get their sandwich. They seem to have a ton more staff and a more efficient ordering system. You can call in your order, which should save you at least 10 minutes. Surprisingly, the increased number of staff doesn't really translate to a much shorter wait. It's still a 10-15 minute wait to get your sandwich. The staff are all pretty cool, though, and without the long line winding out of the old shop, there's a more festive atmosphere compared to the "i'm waiting in a 30-minute line for a sandwich" mentality from before. So here's the thing about Ike's sandwiches: just because you can stuff everything under the sun between two pieces of bread, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a good sandwich. There's something like 150 choices for sandwiches at Ike's. Don't make the mistake of going there without doing your research. Go to the website and find the exact sandwich you want. They only have about 20 on the menu displayed at the shop. I'd be flabbergasted if you couldn't find a sandwich enticing yet different from your run-of-the-mill turkey on white. I've had a few different sandwiches from Ike's, and although they've been good, I would say that the hype definitely pumps up this place. You can get mozzarella sticks in your sandwich. But every sandwich I've had here has been good. Not great. More interesting than delicious. And messy. Grab a stack of napkins on the way out. The chicken fried chicken in my Jaymee Sirewich was not particularly flavorful, and it was drowned in BBQ sauce, which meant that it was no longer crispy. The yellow BBQ was excellent, though. I also love the Dutch Crunch rolls that they come on. For $10, I just didn't feel like it wowed me. The grilled chicken in some of the other sandwiches (Spiffy Tiffy) was also overcooked and you couldn't taste the pesto. Solid 3.5 stars for the sandwich, bump it up to 4 stars for the variety. It's just something you can't get anywhere else (except for the Ike's in Palo Alto, I guess).
I love love love Little Lucca sandwiches.Nothing beats a Lucca. Bay area folks, you know what I'm talking about. Transplants... probably not so much. Anyway.This place has changed my mind.Everything is so fresh and juicy.There's so much variety.The staff there are super friendly; they make you feel comfortable.My only complaint is, some sandwiches can be skimpy with the meat...(Now, I'll have to change my name when I go there) Tips:A must try is the Paul Reubens. Seating is super super limited.There's no tables.Parking's a pain.You have to ask for pickles, jalapeo, and banana peppers (otherwise, it's left out) Beware of hipsters.
Nacho Boy for the avocado-eating carnivore. Elvis Keith for those who like a hint of wasabi. (like me!)Make sure to ask for the extra freebie things like banana peppers & tomatoes. I asked for tomatoes last time but they didn't include them. Which made my sandwich kinda bland. You can always eat at Sophie's Cafe as long as you buy a drink there. Or head over to Dolores Park and get Bi-rite ice cream for dessert!
After seeing Adam eat the Kryptonite sandwich on Man v. Food it was quickly added to my list of places to eat the next time I could make it out to San Francisco.After fighting tooth and nail with severe traffic throughout most of the day while coming back from Napa Valley, we finally found our way to Ike's and I rushed out of the car to get in line.Surprisingly, the line was only 2 people deep when I got into the door on a Saturday around 7:15pm. Although I didn't see it on the menu, I ordered a Kryptonite sandwich. The cashier did ask me if I wanted lettuce and tomato and of course I said: "yes, everything".The new Ike's Place location is across the street from the old Ike's, but appears to still be undergoing renovation (the Ike's Place sign is simply painted onto the window, and there are no tables or seats, only 1 bench).Not too long after I arrived a line began to form that went out the door (though this shop is a bit cramped to say the least).After about 15 minutes my sandwich was ready. Although Ike was not here, one of the workers came out with my sandwich in a nondescript brown paper bag and yelled out my name. The Kryptonite was already sliced in half and between my friends we secured a seat on the only bench and munched away.For those not in the know, the Kryptonite sandwich has 13 ingredients, 7 of which are of various meats. I took my first eager bite and immediately the sauce (which is a garlic and spiced mayo concoction made in-house) and the fresh, tender ingredients flooded my senses and went directly into my brain. This was unlike any sandwich I have ever eaten before. There really is something special to be said about the sauce, which totally makes this sandwich. Everything about the sandwich was perfect: from the freshly toasted bread, the sauce, and the fresh, delicious meats to the onion rings and jalapeno poppers. A few things to note before you come here:1) Apparently it's illegal to eat on the sidewalk. I guess this is why all orders are to-go. You'll want to secure a seat on the bench or eat it in your car;2) The parking situation is awful; like anywhere else in SF, you'll have to drive around to find a spot;3) The number on Ike's website as well as their operating hours is incorrect. Yelp correctly lists their operating hours;4) Credit cards are accepted; 5) A bag of chips is included in the price.6) It plays the best of 80's music nice and loud. If you love 80's music as much as I do, this just makes the experience that much more wonderful;7) You get 2 free caramel-apple pops along with your sandwich.I also had the privilege of trying a bite of the Menage A Trois sandwich, which was almost as delicious as the Kryptonite.Ike's Place sets a new bar in the sandwich industry and is definitely not to be missed during a trip to SF. It was well worth the trouble getting there and I definitely plan on coming back the next time I am in SF.
Wow.Wow.Greatest sandwiches on EARTH. The line is out the door to this place. My friends have all had it, so when I went up north for a wedding I had to get some. We ordered 4 hours in advanced for like 40 sandwiches. When we arrived they were all ready, it was great. Took it to the Golden Gate bridge and got our eat on. If I could have one sandwich before I die, it'd be from Ike's.Place is amazing. Words don't cut it.
This rating is temporary and doesn't reflect the sandwiches. It seems there's no way to contact them by email. Not all of us use facebook and twitter. Ike's place people: I had some problems with my order, wrote you a very polite email asking about your general practices so as to avoid just writing a negative review on yelp, and now I have no way of sending it. I've been looking on your website for the past ten minutes, the only options are to give you all my info to sign up for your emails, but there's no way for me to contact you. Please give me an email address and I'll delete or upgrade my current rating.
Delish - off the beaten path for us tourists.Line was out the door - but worth it.One of the best sandwiches I have ever hadTogo would be best -we had to grab some windowsill to sit inlove the caramel apple pops that you find at the bottom of the bag! BONUS!
This place makes really delicious sandwiches.  The bread was fluffy and the ingredients fresh.  The staff was extra friendly and helpful. A must visit area when nearby.
I always always always always always always always order the Menage a trois, chips, and a real sugar root beer; always.
This place clearly doesn't need any more reviews, but coming from NYC, I figured it's worth a review. A native SF friend recommended it to me, and at first I was put off by the twenty minute wait in life...but totally worth it! I got the "we're just friends" (they had me pepper jack...) on the Dutch crunch. Cashiers were super friendly, and the sandwich was delicious. Yes, a little on the pricey side, but I'm from New York sooo nothing shocking.Will hit this up again next time I'm on the left coast.
I'm not a big sandwich person, given the choice I will almost always order something else. But I will trek across town during the Muni rush hour for Ike's! It's worth it trust me! The kid sis and I decided to go for the first time and wow was I disappointed in myself for not trying them sooner! We tried the Menge A Trois which is chicken smothered in both BBQ and Honey Mustard (my two fav condiments ever) and the Damon Bruce, hello ribeye, A1 and onion rings! Both were delicious and both were huge. Each sandwich comes with a bag of chips and we made two meals out it. So good but soo much food! Great selection of unique sodas. Huckleberry Soda? Yes Please! The only thing that could improve Ike's is if they had seating ad you could stay and enjoy. I understand why they don't though, I know lots of people that would never leave!
The store moved a block down into the former shop of Joseph Schmidt's. It's a better store with more space, affording them to have 3 registers and a large kitchen in the back room (where candy used to be made) for an army of people to make sandwiches (you can see them working away). The prices have gone up to an avg of $9 each. The "Lincecum" costs a whopping $11.11. Gone are the "Superman" and "Batman", replaced by another Giants player, "Matt Cain". My "Spiffy" was pretty tasty and hubby liked his "Hollywood". It's hard to finish the whole sandwich, so you can easily save the other 1/2 for another meal. A fella comes out of the kitchen w/your bag of sandwiches, calls out your name, checks your receipt and you walk over to the wall of bags of sm. chips and help yourself to 1 bag per sandwich order. They have great sodas - Empire brand, to name one. I tried a lemonade, which was pricey for $2.70/bottle, but it was really, really good. I wasn't that impressed the first time I tried an Ike's sandwich, but the "Spiffy" I had today will have me going back for more. Parking is difficult, as always and if you show up around 11AM-Noon, there will be a line of people with folks sitting down on the sidewalk in front of the store, like homeless folks, eating their sandwiches, chips and drinks.
Finger lickin' good! I heard about this place on Foodnetwork! There was an episode about America's best sandwich spots and Ike's was amongst the bunch. Ike's is a really small shop, but that gives it a lil' charm. When we got there, there was a line out the door, but it moved fast and it allows you to look through their plentiful menu. I got "Change", which is a sourdough sandwich composed of thinly sliced steak, onion rings, smoked gouda, and all the works smothered in their tasty bbq sauce. My friend got the "Super Mario" which was a yummy meatball sandwich. They also sell all your favorite nostalgic sodas in those classic glass bottles. I picked up a bottle of Henry Weinhard's rootbeer (YES, there's definitely a difference!) Everything tasted so good together. mmm I'm salivating just thinking of it!!! Total: $25 for 2 sandwiches and 2 bottles of soda. The guys who work there are so down to earth and friendly. Only 4 tables outside to sit and eat, but turnover rate is fast. There's only street parking, but it's limited to 2 hours so ppl are always leaving. I'm definitely coming back to try some of their other sandwiches!
Alright, so off the bat the food itself would be 5 stars all the way. But a two hour wait for sandwhiches to me is a bit much! But honestly, it WAS worth it. I got the menage a tois, (don't mind the spelling) and it was delicious had like the halal chicken, honey, honey mustard, bbq, and three cheeses. Though it was really good, it was kinda sweet for me so I will opt for a different option. The quality of the ingredients AND the bread (you have to get dutch crunch) as my friend suggested, it's amaaazing. TIP: If you want your sandwhich at like 3:00 pm, call at 1pm and go pick it up because first there isn't really any seating and second it takes about two hours. I think it's because they bake their bread WHEN you order so it's super duper fresh. But just click their website and check out their options, they have SO MUCH. I'm sure they are all great. Try it out, you have to!! It'll keep you full for a whole day!
I loved the sandwiches especially the Philly steak one. the sauce and breads they use are amazing and so delicious, not a clean place though! it is good for take out :)
Ok, I love this place! The Halal sandwiches are the most healthy options if you are on a carb binge. If you want one of the most amazing reubens outside of NYC try the Paul Reubens you will not be disappointed! Thanks Ike for opening by the lake in Oakland.Unfortunately, I had to take one star off because the last time I had a sandwich, you guys left out the avocado on my sandwich. That was a bummer because I walked all back to work before I realized....you know the feeling...
I always get the Jaime Sirewich on dutch crunch with everything! So so so tasty, and filling! My girlfriend gets the "If I Were Straight", which is freaking hillarious. Tons of vegan and vegetarian options too! And, the price is right for the amount of food you get!
Complete winner sandwich, nothing more to say!
This place. I can't even begin. SO GOOD! I actually DRIVE across the city for these sandwiches. Perfect for vegetarians! Their veggie chicken is some of the best I've ever had. Definitely get the dutch bread.My advice: ORDER AHEAD. Sometimes it takes an hour for them to fill your request. This shouldn't be a problem if you order ahead. You can skip the line and go right to the front left register to pick up your order if you called it in. Once you have your sandwiches, there is no seating. That's ok, just grab some napkins & take a little walk to Dolores park. Have a little picnic and do some hipster-watching. Rinse your fingers in a water fountain after. Perfect day. OR, do what I do and park around the corner (probably blocking someone's driveway) and stuff your face in the car. Either way, these sandwiches are worth it. My favorites? Love Triangle, Pilgrim, Tom Brady...
No review necessary other than....o.m.g!!
Kryptonite... Rightfully named because I get faint just thinking about it.For reals though, this place was hyped, Yelped, and raved by every conceivable person I know who has eaten there. When I saw all the ingredients in the Kryptonite (which my friends suggested), I was very skeptical: thinking that all those flavors would just mash together to make utter chaos and taste "meh."First bite, I found love. By the time I was finished, I realized that the answer was no longer 42, but Ike's sandwiches. Okay, I'm exaggerating. Not to completely blow your expectations through the ceiling, but the Kryptonite did destroy my previous conception of the oversized/overpacked sandwich concept. I could actually taste each of the complex flavors found in the sandwich and they all complemented each other well. Each meat was very good quality. The pesto/mozzarella/jalapenopopper combo carried the sandwich beyond the "cheddar cheese/mayo" filler of most sandwiches, giving the sandwich a kick I did not expect (not to mention, all that fried goodness in a sandwich).Basically, Ike's gave giant subs another chance for consideration. After all the great reviews, I truly came here with really cautious expectations, but I left with a very, very satisfied customer.
This place doesn't need another in depth review, so I'm just going to say: I ate the hell out of my sandwich.I'm not even going to tell you what sandwich I got, because I honestly don't think it matters; you can't go wrong with this place when you're fiending.
Ever since the hype from Man vs. Food coming to Ike's the lines have been pretty insane, but I say it's still definitely worth the wait. The crew is always exceptionally friendly and welcoming. And I think they're great for being patient with and giving suggestions to all of the new customers trying to order a sandwich from that monster menu. Ike's makes by far the best sandwiches I've ever had. I usually get the Pizzle (add pesto), but every single thing I have ordered has been delicious. And I don't know what is in the dirty sauce, but whatever it is it tastes like heaven. If you haven't been to Ike's yet, you need to try it. These sandwiches will change your life.
Amazing food, amazing vibe, amazing staff, surprisingly fast considering the long lines. Definitely go check it out!
Wow- Pastrami Charmed Life... sooo good. Plus the Voodoo chips are awesome! In fact, I was searching for the chips when I found Ikes! So great!
Converted to sandwich lover after eating Ikes. This place has some amazing sandwiches!!!! Every time I go to Ikes, I get super giddy because I know my taste buds will be doing a happy dance.
When I went they were out of avocadosand out of the kind of bread I wanted BUT my sandwich was still delicious. I think it has to do with their special sauce. I'm excited to go back when they have everything available to try something else :).
I'm gonna agree with all my fellow yelpers and say that Ike's sandwiches are amazing. Despite the madness of waiting in line to order and having nowhere to sit and eat my sandwich, I give Ike's 5 stars. Make sure you bring cash, a large appetite, and some patience. I came on a Saturday around noon, and although we tried to order ahead of time, there was already a 2-hour phone wait. I suggest getting your sandwiches to go and then enjoying them at Dolores Park, which isn't too far away. Highly recommended: Eli Manning (chicken, garlic sauce, mushrooms, avocado, cheddar cheese) and Ex-boyfriend (salami, bacon, cheddar cheese, avocado). So what makes these sandwiches so good? The freshly baked bread, dirty sauce, and unique combination of ingredients. Try it for yourself and you won't be disappointed!
well.. this place already has 5000 reviews so i'm sure it doesn't need another long winded speigl on how good their magic sauce is.. if you dont know by now, just look at the numbers.. try it.. enjoy.. (fyi - if you order one of those insane oversized sandwiches with 600 different kind of meat and 42 different fried things, each bite only lets you get a mouthful pastrami or 7 fried mozzarella sticks.. which obviously isn't going to be awesome, honestly dont know why these things are on the menu, it drags the place down. ) Don't be fat America.. order something normal.
Third time here and still loving it!Big portion and one of a kind!! Describing it won't be enough for you- you just GOTTA go and try it for yourself! Take my word for it- you won't be disappointed.
I HATE WAITING IN LINE! But I have to say that it was worth it. After watching Man v food SF, my Hubby & I had to try this place before we get to our destination - Big book sale. Thanks to yelp reviewers - we checked their menu online like they told us to so we kind of decided on what we'd order from 188 sandwiches! I wasn't very hungry... Well I was not convinced that sandwich can be that good so we ordered #2 & added mozzarella stick on the side plus chai cola. Chai cola has an authentic Chinese medicine like taste - very interesting. You gotta try it. And of course the sandwich was really delicious! One of the best sandwiches I've ever tried! I can't wait to go back there & try other combination but I HATE WAITING IN LINE. Maybe I'll call first next time.
The combinations are so unique and scrumptious. Thanks Ike.
After seeing Ike's on one our favorite show Man vs. Food and reading about it in the latest 7x7 Magazine, we had to check i tout for ourselves. Obviously word has gotten out about Ike's as the line was about an hour and a half long. Luckily we had our phones so we could look up the full menu online as we didn't know there were so many options. As time drew near for us to place our order I finally made my decision and gave it to the very nice gal at the cash register. "Al Bundy with mozzarella sticks." When Ike delivered the meal he said I made a good choice in selecting the sticks and I couldn't agree more.My fiancee got the Menage a Trois and that was delicious as well. Next time I think we're going to call ahead instead of waiting in the long line even though it was worth it.
I was so excited to finally try Ike's! The like was short so I was even happier (it was a Wednesday around 3:30-4). I ordered a "Going Home for Thanksgiving" which has turkey, cranberry sauce, SRIRACHA, and havarti. I love sriracha so I had to order it. I was expecting it to have an interesting taste and it did, but it a good way. It was probably one of the most interesting and flavorful sandwiches I've ever had. I wanted to take a picture of it, but I was too excited too eat it so I didn't get a chance. I pretty much devoured that thing. I can't wait to go back to Ike's and try all of the other sandwiches!!!Free Chips!
I'll have to go again for a better gauge. We got the Lex Luther and while good, the french dressing was a tad overpowering and I didn't really taste any chicken fried steak. I know this is probably blasphemy to everyone reading this post, but I may have a more upbeat update at a later date. And there isn't anywhere to sit and eat :-(.We went to Philz afterward and that was actually our highlight. I'M SORRY! I wanted to love you Ike's.
Dear Ike,Please consider opening a satellite storefront in little ole Boston--we are nearly devoid of delicious vegan/veggie sandwich options, which makes me very sad. Simply put, I love your sandwich shop so much that, while devouring the "Love Triangle", I strongly considered moving to San Fran in order to be within eating distance of it. A suggestion - it would be great if you provided the full list of your sandwiches in a place other than the internets, such as an old school hand-held menu, as I didn't realize what a vast array of tasty options there were until too late. Regardless, I will love you forever. Hugs,Joanne
Is it bad that I miss the old Ike's? The Ike's where you had to call in an hour before your sandwich was even being toasted in the oven - and STILL had to wait 15 minutes after that?This Ike's is definitely more efficient, although it still takes a while for your sandwich to arrive. I ordered "Change," the same sandwich I'd been ordering at Ike's for 4 years in a row. I can't bring myself to deviate.I had never been to this new location and the sandwiches being churned out were definitely a bit smaller. I never thought the old Ike's sandwiches were ginormous so these were a bit too tiny for my tastes, though I am used to eating the mondo, arm-sized sandwiches from Little Lucca. The flavors and textures were great as usual, but they didn't stand out as much as I recalled from the Ike's of yore. Less sauce, less meat. However, the sandwiches are still good, and I will probably still come back a few times despite the wait.
Holy.. it does not get better than this!I called in ahead of time to order the menage a trois and nacho girl and got to detour the long line straight to the cash register. While paying for my sandwiches, I was surprised when Ike's himself came out of the kitchen with several bags of sandwiches in his arms! We took our sandwiches to Crissy Field near Golden Gate and enjoyed our sandwiches on the grass. I know this is a bold statement to make but I have to say these were the best sandwiches I have ever tasted... The sandwiches melded so well together and the secret garlic-y dirty sauce was what made all the difference! I'm not kidding but so many dogs of all sizes at the park ran over to our sandwiches and would not leave. They knew what was up! Be aware these are messy sandwiches as the sauce tends to drip everywhere. I felt full after eating half of my menage a trois but the other half was too good to not eat.. The two sandwiches must have been around 6lbs+ but a short 15 minutes later, they disappeared into our very very satisfied bellies.Can't wait to go back!
Mozzarella sticks are now a topping on sandwiches because of Ikes. Incredible. Doc one point for the bread which is too boring for the ridiculousness of their toppings. Focaccia people! It's just better.
I had seen the long lines every weekend around lunch time (and extending in the middle afternoon...). I took the opportunity to spend a day at home to check it out during the week. Still a line but way shorter. The sandwiches are huge but delicious and I finished it all... and I am usually not a big sandwich eater!
The bf and I had to try this place after seeing it on Man vs. Food and Diners Drive-Ins and Dives. It was definitely to our advantage to follow the advice of previous yelpers and call in ahead of time. We called in for pickup at 2pm and when we got there at 1:59PM, our sandwiches were getting wrapped up as we paid!! It made me happy to think that we skipped the long line, which was out the door and wrapped up the block.First things first, I want to put out there that this place has the BEST sandwich I've ever had.Now, onto what we ordered:-Menage a trois: I tried this because it was in so many yelp reviews. Following a yelpers advice, I ordered it with bacon. What a wonderful idea!!! The crunchy, smoky, salty bacon perfectly compliments the sweet honeyed, similar to bbq flavor of the hallal chicken. Foodgasmic!-Secret Sandwich: you get this by gaining two points on their website. They will reveal a secret sandwich to you once you have completed both points. All I can say is that it was almost as good as the previous sandwich.-Bottled Lemonade: very refreshing-Bottled Blackberry Soda: loved it!**The Dirty chips are free with purchase of a sandwich: I loved the fusion and jalapeno flavors**What I really like about this place is that they use technology to market their restaurant and make things more efficient. Not only are you able to call in, order on their website, but you can also order from an iphone app! (not sure if the app works on other phones)The service is also wonderful, 5 stars to boot!
Delicious sandwiches and tons of gluten free options. Best sandwiches in the bay area!
This place is pretty good for a big, hearty sandwich. I've only been here twice but both times I'd had a good experience. I've tried the Menage a trois and Name of the girl I'm Dating. My favorite is still the Menage a trois (still good even after 4 hours). I liked the bbq sauce mix with the honey. It made the sandwich very juicy and filling. Dutch crunch is a must here. It's so good! My favorite type of bread to go with sandwiches like this. They don't have the menus at this location, so I'd highly suggest going online before you get there to get a better idea of what sandwich you'd want to get. The wait can be long, so I'd suggest ordering ahead to pick up or go early if you don't want to wait in line. Overall great sandwiches. Bring a light jacket and on sunny days, take the sandwiches and walk a couple blocks to Dolores Park and enjoy the nice scenery and weather.
This place is tasty and has plenty of concoctions to choose from. We got their Nacho Boy- Hot Roast Beef, Mushrooms, Avocado, Swiss with all the veggies and jalapenos, very yum. There was plenty of meat and avocado dripping everywhere.Cowboy Curtis- Sliced Corned Beef, Home Made Poppy Seed Coleslaw, BBQ, Smoked Gouda on dutchcrunch, the beef was tasty and soft, the slaw was flavorful, bbq sauce and smoked Gouda went very well. Overall, both sandwiches were very good and can't wait for another trip out here to try another tasty sandwich! And Ike even comes out to deliver your sandwich when it's done! Plus- We came when Adam from Man vs. Food was filming!
I got the Menage a Trois, not by suggestion, but because anything with BBQ sauce in it gets my attention. Anything with BBQ sauce, honey mustard, AND pepperjack cheese? OH HELL YES. This brilliant combination between two slices of dutch crunch bread was the highlight of my week. This must be some sort of sadistic behavioural experiment on classical conditioning because anything phonetically similar to "Ike's" and my mouth pools with saliva. Sick. But soooooo goooood. Minus one star for lack of seating. I loved my sandwich, but was so sad to see the BBQ sauce and honey mustard goodness get wasted as it stained the lap portion of my jeans as I tried to maneuver this humongous sandwich without a place to rest my elbows. That doesn't change the fact that it was so good, the thought of eating my jeans after spilling had crossed my mind twice. No shaaaame.
Even though I lived 2 blocks from Ike's for a couple years, I rarely went because of the crazy lines. We'd try to call in an order and it would take 3 hours sometimes. So with their 2nd move to the old chocolate shop next door to Tangerine, it was finally time to revisit. I called it in the night before for an early pick up, just in case. No lines at all and my sandwiches were ready on time. I saw their huge kitchen, big waiting area, a separate line for pickup orders and was assured everything is finally under control including their sandwich making process and wait times. So the sandwiches are still delicious and unique, but they definitely seemed skimpy in the meat department. I don't remember them being so damn saucy either. The prices have risen, $10 average, but you get a bag of Dirty Chips for free... I'd prefer a slightly cheaper price and no chips. I was one of Ike's early followers and always assured people it lived up to the hype. Its taste has definitely lost a little something but I'll be back as long as the lines stay manageable.
While visiting SF last month, my friend said that Ike's Place was voted something or other on Yelp, had the most reviews or something, etc etc and then he mentioned it was a sandwich shop (obviously the only thing I heard was best sandwiches). I will jump at the chance for a good sandwich.  This little place is a block from where my friend lives in The Mission and he warned me that the line wraps around the block and that we would have to order early and then go get it because they are always busy. I thought, no problem. How long of a line could it be? I figured, order and pick it up in 15-30 minutes. Wrong.It's 1030am on Saturday morning (being from the East Coast it's really 130pm and I am STARVING). He orders the sandwiches - Ike's Place has an app for that - and then he says, "Ok, they'll be ready at 1245." ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? That is in two hours and I may eat my arm off. What the heck are they doing? Making my bread from scratch and roasting a fresh turkey?? Yea...so I would totally wait even longer for a sandwich from Ike's. I got the Barry B (simple - turkey, bacon, swiss) with avocado and I don't know what the others got because I was just focused on mine. Super duper tasty bread - nice crust and soft on the inside - lots of turkey AND practically a whole avocado. They also have a secret dirty sauce which really makes the sandwich. There are some interesting sandwich combos on their menu and lots of vegan options which is cool (but very SF I guess?). All sandwiches come with chips and a lolli. Awesome! Prices are little more than normal sandwiches, but dude, it's worth it. I wish I had one right now....
Try having a Menage A Trois here. It won't be your last.
Great sandwich with a great secret sauce. Not great for dining in but highly recommended for take out. I especially recommend the steak sandwich.
Gah, stupid me - forgot to ask for dirty sauce! I was really sad when I realized I missed out. I had the We're Just Friends. It was pretty good, but the orange sauce on the chicken was not quite as amazing as I thought it would be. The "fusion" dirty chips were really good, and of course, love the free lollipop!
I was so very sad to leave San Francisco on my most recent visit, but Peg Bundy brought a smile to my face even as my plane departed from SFO. Peg Bundy the sandwich that is. Breaded eggplant, french dressing, avocado, cheddar, on a wheat roll, with dirty sauce and lettuce and tomato. I also added sriracha, which, in my humble opinion, is never a bad idea. Plus free chips and a caramel apple pop? Umm sorry mom, but Ike's has you beat in the "packing my lunch" category.It was saucy (take that however you please) and absolutely delicious. The bread was warm and fresh-baked; the avocado added a beautiful fresh flavor amidst eggplant and cheddar delight. Pity me that I have to wait until my next visit to SF to recreate the experience.I do, however, feel badly for the dude sitting next to me on the plane. Because he didn't have an Ike's sandwich, and I wasn't sharing. (ok, maybe sharing food with a stranger on a plane could be considered weird, but technically we were still in SF, and they're ok with that sort of thing).
I LOVE SANDWICHES but this place doesn't serve just any sandwich...they serve SUPER LARGE, FULL-OF-FLAVOR sandwiches. We ordered the Menage a Trois and shared. The sandwich was as big as my head! The chicken was breast meat but it was not dry at all. It was so full of flavor the juices were dripping from the bottom.We took our sandwich to go but even after driving a bit and finally settling to eat, our sandwich wasn't soggy, but instead the juices had soaked into the chicken. This sandwich was unlike any other that I've had. If only I could've preserved a couple of sandwiches to bring home to Hawaii with me. =o)
The way to approach Ike's is to think of it as an Experience. I know that sounds absurd, given that a sandwich is one of the most down-to-earth meals in existence, but it's best to just trust me here. My coworkers organized a sammich-order the other day, and it went like this: we called at 10:30, and our order of half a dozen-ish sandwiches was ready at 12:45. Yikes! you say. Well, that's what happens when a business is really small and really popular. Plan ahead, accept that you'll wait longer for a sandwich than for brunch at any of the hottest spots in town, and decide that's part of the fun. You can also apply annoying platitudes as needed: "good things come to those who wait", "go with the flow", etc.The actual sandwich was divine. I ordered the Strawberry Girl, and the best aspect of it was the Dutch Crunch bread - it was somehow the perfect texture and temperature even after being transported across town. The other ingredients were fresh and yummy, and the Dirty Sauce was delicious (as advertised).In short, the food is excellent and the story of the two-hour+ wait will get you through many a small talk situation. This is much more valuable than the bag of greasy chips you'd get someplace else, no?
Ike, Ike, Ike, whoever you are, one day I need to meet and ask you what the source of your delicious sandwiches is. These sandwiches are damn GOOD. This is probably why it attracts every hipster and indie boy/girl from the Mission/Castro area, but it's totally worth the 10-15 minute wait for your sandwich. The sandwiches with their punny names are made to perfection and they come with lollipops, chips and a drink. Last Friday I went up to the cutie working the counter and ordered the "We're Just Friends", hoping he'd pick up on my hint that the guy I was with was just a friend. No dice, but he did say "thanks beautiful," and gave me a ton of extra lollipops. The vibe here is really chill, mostly because the people here are really friendly and know how to appreciate a good sandwich. However, I do NOT recommend coming here on a first date. The sandwiches are all covered in Ike's famous delectable super-messy Dirty Sauce, and no one looks attractive shoveling a whopping sammie into his mouth with Dirty Sauce dripping all over his fingers, no matter how good it is.
Loved it. The line was always out the door when i went though. The menu is distributed at the counter. If you don't see it anywhere just ask a cashier for it, all the employees are friendly. I always get the same thing though "i'm a vegetarian, sometimes". Apparently i always end up only eating the vegetarian menu when i'm in nor cal. Every time i stopped to eat here i always saw Ike, himself, helping out and really wanting to hear feedback from consumers. I don't really see a lot of restaurant owners getting so involved so it was refreshing and made my meal a little more enjoyable.Also you get a bag of baked chips and a lollipop with every meal :]
The "Soup Nazi" of sandwich makers... the product is pretty good, that much I'll admit, but they also cost way too much and they act like it's a privilege to be a customer. It just isn't worth the wait or the expense.
The sandwiches are huge and absolutely delicious. I love how they name sandwiches after the baseball pitchers names from the Giants. I had the Matt Cain and it was heaven in my mouth. The lines are long but they entertain you so it keeps it fun.
The Matt Cain World Championship Edition. 'Nuff said.No words to describe how beautiful this experience was. Well worth every penny. Sandwich, kettle chips, and a dr. pepper. What could possibly be better? We need to get these guys a read store front so I have a place to sit while eating the monstrous creations. But, a bench in the park will do. =)
We need to refuel after climbing twin peaks. We split an Elvis Keith, it was damn tasty. Halal chicken, teriyaki, wasabi mayo, swiss and a squirt of sriracha on dutch crunch... not your usual sandwich. I appreciated that.
I got the Spiffy Tiffy on Dutch Crunch: (Avocado, Halal Chicken, Mushrooms, Pepper Jack, Pesto, Provolone) It was just a sandwich. It wasn't a party, or a miracle, or a dream come true. I mean, don't get me wrong, it was decent. It was also HUGE, and pretty cheap for the size.Best bet is to order ahead of time, skip the line.
YES, this place is THAT good. There are over 3000 reviews for this place, but I have to praise it with another review because they gave me the best sandwich I've ever eaten in my entire lifeeeeMy friends and I got there around 12, which is right before their peak lunch hour (12:30) so we were in n out of there within half an hour. Nacho Boy on dutch crunch- Extra dirty sauce and pickles We drove over to Golden Gate Park and literally just sat in silence eating our freakin amazing sandwiches for a good 10-15 minutes. Then we spent the next 10-15 minutes talking about how DELICIOUSSSS our sandwiches were. Then we enjoyed the free bag of chips and caramel apple lollipops that came with it!GET THE EXTRA DURRTYY SAUCE!! I'm not sure what's in it, but it's heaven in the form of creamy sauce drizzled all over your sandwich that oozes into every crevice of crunchy bread. drooooooooooool
Ikes reigns supreme. The Eli Manning is great. A must for any visit to SF. Ill be moving here soon so I am sure ill become a regular
I saw this place on man vs. food and I had to check it out I got to say I'm so glade I went hands down u want a Bomb sandwich go to Ike's ! the only thing they need there is some tables. Soooooo worth it don't hesitate.
Over rated sandwich place. How many types of turkey sandwiches can you make? No but honestly it is not bad at all, just not over 3 star.
One time when my fiance and I drove into San Francisco, we wanted a different place to eat. Immediately, my fiance used Yelp to help us find someplace to eat. The great reviews about Ike's Place were overwhelming and we were immediately intrigued. When we first got to Ike's, we were astounded by the almost 45 minute line just to order food and another 20 minutes to receive our food. However, the reviews did not fail us. Everything at Ike's is delicious and totally worth the wait. I love the Thanksgiving sandwich and the fact that the people working took the time to give me a suggestion on how to make it even better.Now, in their new location, the wait isn't nearly as long (at least the times I've experienced it), but the food is just as good if not better! Ike's deserves way more than 5 stars!
You can never go wrong with Ike's - it's always amazing !!
EAT THE SANDWICH WHILE IT'S HOT!Very tasty sandwiches. I have not been disappointed, except when someone brought me a sandwich to go. Not good cold. :( Must be experienced first hand.Love the names and the sandwiches. Example: [name of girl I'm dating] The menu is extensive, but you start to see a pattern that Ike has given you various options already created in the best way possible.Hearty sandwich, super tasty halal chicken... sandwiches come with chips and it's worth grabbing a cheer wine to enjoy in the park!
Yummy, HUGE sandwiches. Got the Lincecum and the We're Just Friends. Seemed pricey at first to pay $25 for 2 sandwiches and a drink, but chips were included and the sandwiches lasted us two meals. Only drawback is the wait. We phoned in the order and it still took 40 mins.
Tried it last night "SF Giants" it was pretty good . Will come back and try something else .
pretty great sandwiches.their dirty sauce is pretty great.the menage a trois on dutch crunch is yum.it may be a tad sweet but its very creamy and yum.their sandwiches are warm and a good size.comes with potato chips....they're not good with following directions though, they forgot to put my dirty sauce on the side and also forgot to put the sauce in my bag.also had the barry z. on wheat which is tasty..
Oooh! That sauce...you'll need a wet-nap after but it's worth it!
This place was great! I came here with a friend while visiting, and the only thing that was a let down was that they were out of their Gluten Free bread. I was about to turn away when the girl behind the counter told me I could wrap the sandwich in lettuce! I was sooooo excited. It was delicious and a monster of a sandwich. I think I only ate half and was unable to even think about food for another 8 hours. It was totally work the visit, but next time I will make sure to share with a friend.
Smoking Hot Vegan sandwiches!
Pretty good sandwiches. Bread to meat ratio was great. Dutch crutch was tasty and soaked up all the mayo goodness. We went at an off peak time and parking was still ridiculous to find. Worth the trip if you're in the mood for a sandwich.
Do I even bother adding a review of a place that already has 1,000+ reviews? First of all, it is so awesome to be able to get a bunch of different creative sandwiches that are vegetarian that are more than just the basic cheese and veggie. Pretty much any of their sandwiches can be made with fake meet. For example I got a vegetarian version of a chicken, sweet mustard sandwich with fake chicken. Second, this dirty sauce that they smother on the sandwich is pretty incredible. A nice kick to the sandwich and makes sure everything is nice and moist. Quite a few bread selections, but the dutch crunch is the bomb.Aside from sandwiches they have bags of chips and a small cooler of drinks. So why am I only giving 4 stars? Well, I really wanted to give 4.5, but that wasn't an option. The 1/2 star take off would be for the challenge with seating. Just a few tables out front and long lines, so you have people peering over your shoulder if you happen to grab a coveted table. I can't wait to go back and try another option. Thanks to M for suggesting this place.
I love this spot. Best sandwich spot in the whole SF City.
I think it's all great. I just don't like how their sandwiches are saucy. Not a big saucy fan. Besides that it was delicious. But it's pretty out of my way, so wont be back unless I'm in the area.
Finally tried this place after living 2 years in SF. Normally I "Don't believe the Hype" but this place was spot on. I ordered online I think I got Doomsday and The Damon Bruce... It took my boyfriend I 2 days to eat it. The flavors were awesome! My ONLY complaint was this douche was standing in the way of the online pick up area and it seemed like he was in line waiting. The only reason it was annoying was it really wasn't that packed in there and in all the places he could of stood he chose that one... not the brightest crayon in the box. But the food was AWESOME!
I haven't had a sandwich here I didn't love. There was a fried eggplant one that I didn't think I would like but is now my favorite. If you've never been to Ike's, do yourself a favor and leave this very minute to enjoy it. Thank me upon returning home.
Nom nom nom
Best sandwich ever!!!= Menage a trois on Dutch crunch bread.The menage a trois was so delicious and it totally changed my definition of a GOOD sandwich. Sigh, I'll be dreaming about this sandwich until the next time I visit SF...
I am a sandwich fiend, probably eaten at over 20 spots in SF and Ike's blows them all out of the water. I highly recommend checking out their website (ilikeikesplace.com) before you head in because the menu is endless and every sandwich is good. Be prepared to wait a few minutes or call ahead if you are in a rush but the wait is worth every second. By the end of your Ike's sandwich you will be making out with the bread, it's that good.
This place is really good! Sandwiches are amazing! Good for meat eaters and vegan / vegetarians. I try to avoid the lunch rush (lines can get really long).
A unique menu of great tasting sandwiches! Free chips, too. 5 stars! :)
Just went again today. :] got the spiffy again with bacon and red onions. man, i need to try another sandwich! but this sandwich is sooooo good. pretty crowded on a sunday afternoon. parking was horrible. call in your order, run in and pick it up. save yourself some time. the workers are super friendly too
There's a first time for everything and yesterday was my first time having a menage-a-trois. No pun intended lolABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. Thank you, fellow yelpers! I have found myself a new love......at first bite.
Good lord they make good sandwiches. Would go back ... again and again and again and again. You get the point!
came here at about 11 on a sunday. there is like no line whatsoever. after watiing for our sandwiches for a bout 10 mins, then there was a line forming. came here in the nick of time. the good thing about this ikes is that they give chips w/ every sandwich. however there is no where to sit so better know a place to take your sandwich to afterwards.be sure to not sit on the stoops of nearby houses and flats. they will socially ban you. and the neighbors just might flip on you too if they catch you. i had a good amount of experience from when i worked in rwc and went to the one there. overall its really good sandwiches but they come at a price.
there are so many reviews. is there a need for another review?they give you a HUGE sandwich, chips, and take TIME to make their sandwiches. don't expect to sit here comfortably. but love the bright colors that match the names of their sandwiches. and the options are great.solid sandwiches and solid service for a casual joint. YUM!
Major hype, yo'. Sure, they're huge and will undoubtedly fill you up. At $10+ a sandwich, they better damn well fill me up. Taste-wise, all three sandwiches I tried failed to impress. The Spiffy Tiffy teeters on the edge of being bland, Damon Bruce's ribeye was dry and flavorless, the famed Menaige a Trois was grossly sweet and left me singing, I can't get no... sa-tis-fac-tion. It's too bad because all the components actually sounded like they'd work, but all the sauciness on the latter two just killed it for me. Maybe the vegan options taste better, but the ones with meat just make me feel like a fat ass.
It was great!! Try the SUPER MARIO, it's life changing!
OMG! Ike's is now in Santa Rosa!! While tripping around the Castro last year we stopped into Ike's. Being vegan I figured I'd have a rough go, not so at Ike's! In fact all three of us had a vegan sando and we're blown away. My favorite so far if the Tom Brady. Now that they're closer I'll have an opportunity to try the entire vegan menu : )Thanks for coming to Santa Rosa Ike! See you soon . . .
Ike's Place is legit. Sandwiches have a fresh aroma, ingredients are flavorful, and they come loaded with goodness. The place reps San Francisco well: cool signs, sells idiosyncratic T-shirts, people there have that unique but rad vibe, and Ike dresses like a pimp!Food [five stars]:*Ordered no. 24 "Say Hey" (pastrami, bacon, and swiss on dutch crunch) and the "Cowtipper"  -I haven't had pastrami this good for a looooooooong time: it was thick    and juicy (that's what she said!)*I don't know what "Dirty Sauce" is but it's good*They make your sandwich fresh - like literally, the bread is baked upon the order*Holy crap the sandwiches were good!Other [4 - 5 stars]:*Long lines...all the good places have long lines, WTF!? The trick is, it says on the website, to come after 2:30PM*We couldn't wait that long so we called in our order and came 40 minutes later. No big deal, food was worth it; plus anyone can keep themselves busy for an hour, right?*Friendly service - the people there enjoy their work and have the system downFinal Call:*Dang straight I'd be back, holla!
Wow.....best sandwich I ever had. We ordered 4 different types and they were all delish. I recommend ordering whatever sandwich you get on the San Francisco sourdough. So fresh and fulfilling. There is a line out the door but its worth the wait.
Oh, how can I put this place into words ? Hole in the wall TINY little sandwich shop with a HUGE line out front, in the awesome Castro area. The line moves really, really really slow... waited over an hour for 2 sandwiches & amused ourselves by staring at the cracks in the sidewalk.. but let me tell you. THE SANDWICH I HAD WAS AMAZING. The MILF with the works (all the veggies & whatever other crap they can stuff there). Dear lord, the Dutch Crunch bread is divine and the dirty sauce just dribbled and soaked through my chicken & jalepeno poppers, blending all the flavors into a medley of crunchy, warm, savory goodness. Mmm. Warning though --- this sandwich was messy and the sauce got everywhere. Normally I try to aim for my mouth but it just wasn't happening. Good thing I'm a pig & don't care as long as I get most of it to my stomach.Staff is super friendly, the girl at the register was smiley & so nice even after standing there working nonstop. The guy who called our names to give us our food was also really friendly & chatted us for a while & told us some stories about the MILF and pointed out a patio near the library to eat our delicious food ! I'm poor and in school so the price was pretty steep for me : 14$ for a sandwich and cola !? But I'm from SoCal so come on, I had to try it. Definitely coming back whenever I'm in the neighborhood & trying something else off their extensive menu !
I think the TV airing got to Ike's head... Sandwiches are getting progressively worse and longer to make. I can't comprehend how 8 sandwich chefs take upwards of 25 minutes for a single order. I are confused. Also, if you order a sandwich, make sure to be next to the pick-up counter when they call your name, otherwise someone else who never paid for a sandwich will take it. Please give people numbers instead of names. Too confusing. There are about 3 Eric's that get a sandwich the same time I do and there's always a mix up. Ike's is getting sloppy. There's quality and quantity and Ike obviously forgot which one he started with.
Mmmm, good stuff. Im a sandwich fan by nature. Ike's definitely lives up to its reputation. I just might run down there tomorrow! :-)
I like this place a lot. I'd give it 5 stars but I think the food is a little over-priced for what you get. The portion of food is very average, not big, and there's no tables to eat it at, you have to take your food to go. Although Subway is not as good as Ike's, you get half again as much food at Subway for half the price, and there too you have to walk away with your sandwich. Anyway, Ike's is worth visiting even though their prices are higher than they should be.
Ok, so Ike took the time to personally contact me and discuss why I had such a bad experience at Ike's Place. He then responded to all of my concerns and offered me another go-round on the house to see if he could make it up to me. As far as customer service, I think that's tops and give him 5 stars for that. But the reality is that for me the sandwich was still just meh! It's ok, but nothing I would seek out and definitely not for that price range. So I have to stick with giving Ike's 3 stars for the food (although the caramel apple pop is a nice touch, in fact my fave thing about the place).Guess it just wasn't meant to be for us Ike's, but you've got plenty of people who love ya so I think you'll be fine.
My favorite is the Menage a Trois on Dutch Crunch with beer battered onion rings, but they have a wide variety of yummy sandwiches. Try not to go around the lunch hour though, as the wait can be kind of a downer. The apple lollipop that comes with each sandwich provides a nice finishing touch after devouring one of these monsters. Give it a try sometime.
NOM NOM NOM....Menage a trois = ORGASMIC.
Super nice (and funny) staff, delicious sandwiches, and online ordering available. I heart you Ike's.
I love Ike's sandwiches!!! I always call my order in to avoid the lines. I'm obsessed with the Mnage Tois with Fried Chicken and extra dirty sauce!The manager, Angela, was super sweet because I picked up my sandwich and they accidentally heard me wrong on the phone. She was so polite and apologized for the person who took my takeout order. She gave me credit for two more sandwiches. It's my birthday and even though they messed up I still love this place. Thank you for the amazingly addictive sandwiches and great customer service!!!
I agree the sandwiches are very tasty and big, no doubt about that. But since hygiene and sanitary conditions is also a health priority for my life, then I would not go back. The owner makes enough profit to afford 'cleaner, more sanitary' ambience. Maybe hospitals and medical offices in San Francisco would not be over-burdened and costs rising to keep up if we restaurant and food service patrons could be more vigilant and more vocal on the lack of sanitary conditions which our city's health department cannot monitor more frequently.A genre of restaurants that are the worst offenders of gross looking bathrooms and where the food is stored are most of the Asian restaurants in this town. But since they have achieved a more politically influential status at City Hall, the city's inspectors find excuses to look the other way, I guess. How any food item tastes takes a backseat to feeling secure that the food is prepared with hygiene discipline. No wonder public supported hospitals are so overcrowded. Too many locally owned small business restaurants may be to blame for toxic or other malicious microbes infecting people hours or days after injesting food suspiciously prepared in not so sanitary conditions.
The BEST sandwich I've ever eaten, hands down. I'm a vegetarian and there were so many options and variations, it was wonderful! I told the cashier some of the flavors I like and she recommended the Captain Corey: breaded "chicken," pepper jack cheese, avocado, orange sauce, and lettuce and tomatoes. UH-mazing!! And really big too! This is a must-try if you are in San Francisco.
I'm a long term customer of Ike's and frequently find myself going. I find myself regularly getting the Jaymee Sirewich, Matt Cain and even the Doomsday. I can't really complain, good service and good food. Enough said!
This was my first spot on my SF eating trip. I ordered Manage a Trio sandwich. I noticed that each sandwich was brought out one by one and I thought this place wasn't that efficient and kinda slow. I finally got my turn and receive the sandwich. I finally got to unwrap that bad boy and took a first bite. All of sudden I'm already half way through the sandwich and licking my fingers. I seriously think they spread some crack in this sandwich. It was amazing~
The sandwich and chips were fine, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend this place. I guess I am just not hip enough to think a dirty restaurant is a good place to order food.
As an update to my review, I no longer live in SF and have consequently not returned to Ike's. I've decided to change my review not on account of the food, but with respect to how Ike handles his business. I hadn't logged onto yelp in quite some time, but recently found a personal message from Ike apologizing for the situation at Lime, offering an explanation for the issues, and offering ways to amend and apologize for my poor experience. This message was clearly not a boiler-plate message sent to pacify unhappy customers, but was written with a sincere concern for my poor experience. So kudos to Ike and Ike's for caring so much for each customers experience even in light of so much success.
So I finally went to this sandwich shop after all the great reviews and being on tv (man vs. food). When we arrived, I noticed a huge line so I guess that was a good sign, but I didn't realize the wait would be over 30 minutes for a freakn sammich! We waited and had to eat outside since there is no seating in the store. I opened up my sammich and noticed barely any meat slices. The sandwich did taste pretty good, but they were cheap with the meat. I felt like I was eating a wheat salad with pastrami on the side. I wouldn't go out my way to eat at this place again.
WooHoo! As good as it gets! (just like the 5 star rating says). I went for the first time two weeks ago and went again last weekend. Everything is great! I had the Nacho Boy the first time and split a Kryptonite the second time, both were excellent in every way except for price. At Ike's you get a quality sandwich, but you also pay for it. The Kryptonite is just over $19 after tax, it is enough for two, but still on the pricey side. It was a lot of fun to eat , if you want to know what is in it, just look it up on their website (too many things to list). The lines can be really long, the first time I went at 4pm on a Sunday and waited at least 30 minutes.  Call ahead if you can.Parking is a bit tough. The first time I came their were seats outside, but it looks like they are in the middle of a remodel and there are no longer seats outside.
Fabulous peppery pseudo chicken plus honey mustard plus avocado plus cheeeeese! This is called "the blind date."So many options for the vegan, vegetarian, and omnivore. This place is popular and delicious and still down to earth. My favorite sandwich to date.
Oh my god - what a gut bomb and holy sandogasm.  I just ordered from Stanford, and while still quirky, the order was fast and efficient.  Ike has made huge strides in the business, yet his sandwiches still make my heart beat faster with anticipation (or is it the dirty sauce?)
Great. However, It's always a long line during eating hours. Order by phone 30 minutes before since they don't have places to sit and eat inside anyway.
Okay, I love Ike's so this review is said with bundles of love, and purely for improvement purposes! :)I've been going for years and, after toying around with a lot of different sandwiches, the menage a trois wins as my fave. I went this afternoon with my birthday coupon (sign up for their email list, guys!) and I ordered the menage a trois. This was my first time at their new location and I have to say, I'm pretty bummed there's no tables -- the tables were the best part of Ike's at Lime! But back to the sandwich.. it just wasn't as good as I remember it being so many other times before! I think the sauce may have changed? It's definitely runnier now... like, dripping to the point where I couldn't eat it. I got through two bites and had to stop because it was getting all over me! :( The girl there was so nice though and re-wrapped the sandwich for me, to-go. I got home and was excited to dig into the remaining 5/6 of the sandwich (with a plate to catch the sauce!), but, unfortunately, the entire sandwich was soaked through, really soggy, and just not very pleasant to eat so I had to toss it. :( I mean, it was triple wrapped and the sauce soaked through all of the paper, to the point where I had to peel pieces of the paper off of the sandwich. :( I've definitely gotten Ike's to-go an number of times, and this NEVER happened before. The sauce before was thick and dripped on your fingers in the most delicious way! :) That all said, if you haven't been, you have to go. Everyone there is SO great, helpful, nice, awesome, and I love that I always see Ike running around there, being a strong part of his business.
I got the Menage a Trois on Dutch Crunch. It was amazing. The wait was out the door when I went, but the wait didn't seem so long. Yay for free chips and green apple lollipop! There's nothing bad to say about it at all.
Omg finally tried this place and it really lives up to the standard. Service is nice. On my way, I actually got lost cause it was my first time and I gave them a call. The lady on the phone was nice and informative. She even said if I need information, I'm more than welcome to call again. It meant a lot to me cause I heard how busy Ike's is. On to the sandwich! I got the Mnage a Trois for me and a Spiffy Tiffy for the mama. Both were so good and filling! Dutch crunch really is the perfect bread. Voodoo chips are so unique and tasty. It's like a sweet tangy bbq flavor. And on top of that you get a caramel apple lollipop? SCORE!
Best selection of vegetarian & vegan sandwich combos ever!
If you are reading reviews on Ike's then you must already know they make a mean sammich that caters to everyone from the veggie eaters to the halal. They can get a little crazy with the options and their 'undocumented' combinations (oh ya get the off menu #67 Bad Santa) - I wonder if there's a big sandwich called "the Ark" which has two of each meat in it...if not, there should be.
The first time I went to Ike's I did my research online and picked out a sandwich. There are a TON to choose from that are not even on the menu at Ike's. The Super Mario, which is a meatball sandwich with marinara and fried cheese sticks was amazing. There is very limited parking, and there is usually always a long line to get a sandwich so be prepared! If you go large, then the sandwich can get pretty pricey, but a regular usually fills me up.
Worth the hype, and even for a busy Saturday afternoon we were out of there in less than 30 min. Great choice, especially for an afternoon at Dolores Park.
This place is a sandwich lover's (me) dream. I will fly to San Francisco from NYC for Ike's Place.I'm just going to make this short - dirty sauce, sick sandwich combos (would you like some fried mozzarella sticks in your sandwich? uhh..YES), awesome sandwich names, cool staff. Tips: 1) place your order BEFOREHAND. It's near impossible to get through their phone line so just use their iPhone app. 2) Also there is no formal seating, so most people go to the park to eat it, but if you're like me and can't wait, make sure to stalk that window ledge area for a spot. 3) Get there on time for your order...you'd hate for that delicious bread with dirty sauce to get soggy!For about $12, you get a huge ass sandwich, a free bag of Dirty chips, and a caramel apple pop. You think you can't eat this all in one sitting, but you will. It's that good.FYI - Between 3 of us, we got the Joker, Super Mario, and Spiffy Tiffy. All amazing.
This place is amazing! Some of the best sandwiches I have ever had in my life. Their secret sauce is a national treasure. The service is always great here but you might hit long lines in busy hours.
This place makes a great sandwich. Something about that dutch crunch roll keeps one coming back for more!The innovative combinations make the sandwiches more than your average deli sandwich!Personally I favor the [Name of the Girl I'm Dating] which combines chicken breast with avocado, tomatoes, lettuce and "dirty sauce." It's a saucy sandwich, so I don't recommend ordering if you're the kind of person that likes your sandwiches without mayo, toppings, etc. - but if you do, the balance of flavor, warmth and texture makes this sandwich a killer park lunch.Ike's looks out for its customers, entertaining people waiting in the lengthy lines and adding special touches to the order like caramel apple lollipops and free bags of chips. Still, $10-15 is a bit much for a to-go sandwich. This and the sometimes lacking service (I get that there are two hundred people waiting to be fed, but they don't do anything to mitigate this) - keep me from giving it that extra fifth star even though I think it's easily one of the best to-go sandwiches I've ordered.I know many make this recommendation, but definitely call ahead! Well worth it to skip the line.
I was brought here by co-workers who ranted and raved about how great the sandwiches were, and was left wondering what kind of horrible sandwiches they've been making all their lives that would lead them to feel this way. The sourdough was easily the worst I've had since I spent a year in Texas--completely inexcusable in this town. The bacon was paper thin, chewy, flavorless and limp, and the only thing that I could taste for the duration of my truncated meal was some disgusting sauce that reminded me of store-bought croutons and ranch dressing. I made it about a quarter of the way through and pitched the rest of the overpriced slop in the trash, thankful that someone else had picked up the tab. I can honestly say that I've had better food at Denny's, and I didn't have to stand around smelling a bunch of greasy Portland expats in knit caps for half an hour before I got it. I believe the moral of the story is don't expect anyone who sells anything called "vegan steak" to have any idea what to do with real meat.
The best sandwiches ever though I am now Vegan can't have what i want but have been told by Ike he has Vegan sandwiches. I can't wait to try them nom nom nom
Ikes, you had me at the Jaymee Sirewich with onion rings on dutch crunch. Almost no point in writing a review as everyone knows Ike's and loves it. Yep, there is a huge line, but if I were smart I would just order in advance. If only they were open late ...
This is easily the best sandwich I have ever had in my life. I've had a lot of sandwiches too! I live in Oakland and insist that, every we go into SF, we get Ike's. Best best best BEST! Hella Fat Bastard + Avo =Wiiiiiiiin!
Holy mackerel, this place has amazing sandwiches! Great vegetarian and vegan options (although I wish they'd get tempeh bacon, like they use at Herbivore...don't really like their veggie option) unlike Mr. Pickles, for you Mission sandwich-eating fanatics. They also have a social mission--the owner donates dozens of free sandwiches to At The Crossroads, a program in San Francisco that does street outreach to homeless youth. That's an awesome move, Ike!
This place is a must if you're in town! It has the best sandwiches in Cali. I always try something different and it's always delicious. Wait is long, but you can call your order in as well. I never fly into SF without a visit to Ike's!
I mean...I would love to knock down a star for the insane wait, but I can't. Why? Because every wait I had, although long, has been quite an experience. I have been surrounded by hungry happy and interesting people sharing in the common experience that is Ike's. And as much as I want to say the sandwich wasn't worth it all...the trip, the wait, the price, I can't.  As much as it pains me go with the masses and praise Ike's delicious food, I can't help it. It's been months since my last Ike's experience and I still try to find excuses to go back despite the fact I now live an hour away. Not many food joints stick with me like that... so-- I think 5 stars are deserved.
Great Sandwiches, service and quality have always been consistent, and the discount for Vets will keep me going back.
Every sandwich I have ever had here is THE BEST SANDWICH I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. Expensive? A bit. Long wait? You bet. Worth it? HELL YES! I take every visitor here and eat here myself as much as my meager "eating out" budget allows. Excellent vegetarian options, efficient and quick service considering that there is always a crowd, and enormous, delicious sandwiches that make me salivate like Pavlov's dogs at just the very thought of them... Yeah, this place is great. Yelp, please add a sixth star so I can give them the rating they truly deserve!
In Ike's case, THE DIRTIER THE BETTER! It's the infamous dirty sauce baked into all their fresh made bread that literally makes every sandwich find a special place in your heart. you. can't. go. wrong. So many options to choose from... if you hate meat.. theres a sandwich for you! if you're a vegan... theres a sandwich for you!! if you want all your arteries clogged... theres a sandwich for you (and trust me its worth it)! I suggest visiting their website and using the nifty menu search bar thing to find your sandwich soul mate... otherwise ask their staff for a suggestion on what you want they seem to be pretty knowledgable(I mean I'd be too if I worked there... and 100 lbs. heavier) I popped my Ike's cherry with the Jim Rome... awesomethen I had the Matt Cain.... F%&king awesomeThen the Menage trois.... mouthgasm SF Giant.... WINNING! Simply put, I'm out to try every goddamn sandwich on the menu... ps. free bag o'chips & caramel apple lollipop with every sandwich SCORE!cheat sheet: - outsmart the people in line, CALL AHEAD! - Hate reading an entire menu (just give me what I want)- ONLINE MENU that basically reads your mind!!! - WHAT? drinks on Ike? Only if your a student & bring your ID after 4!- That sandwich best not be the only one you ever try!
Incredible food that is worth the wait.
Bomb! Love the dutch crunch!!!!!!!
Normally when I go back to the Bay Area for a visit, I eat at places on my Bay Area must-eat list. I mean come on, one week is not enough time to have the old favorites *and* try new places. But somehow I decided to try a new place when visiting a friend in SF, and it was the best decision of the week. Maybe even the best decision of my life. You know, the best decisions always involve food, right?I was set on getting my usual simple sandwich (roast beef, cheddar, and mayo, on sourdough), even though my friend said I should get one of Ike's specialties. That is, until I saw the simple sandwiches were called "Unoriginals" on the menu board. So, I made an audible and got the Super Mario. The sauce, the fried mozzarella, the meat, the everything was just darn tasty!The sandwiches are on the expensive side and take awhile to make it but are totally worth it. The only bad part was the wife wasn't there to try it with me, so I felt bad telling her how good it was and that she missed out. This place is good enough to be added to the Bay Area must-eat list!
Went last week on my day off with a friend. Went on a weekday around 10, luckily right before a line formed. After ordering, still had to wait for about 15 min for the sandwich.I had: Paradise Found (Ham, Pineapple, Marinara Sauce) on Dutch Crunch (kinda like a pizza)She had: SF Giants on Dutch CrunchI started eating mine since it came first and with all the sauce, I quickly gobbled down half, and finshed the last couple bites as my friend got hers. I managed to share a couple bites of mine.Then I had my friend's sandwich, and it may have been better, save for some aftertaste I'm not sure I liked. I ate more than a few bites of hers.I planned on stopping but my friend urged me to eat my other half, and after about 2 bites I was too full and I gave up (but it was a good snack for later).Also got a Chai Cola from their interesting selection of sodas, but it tasted a bit like medicine and I didn't manage finishing it.And the sandwiches come with a caramel apple lollipop, like the ones I had in middle school for 25 cents! Yum!I must say that it is one of the best sandwiches I've had, and I'm not a huge sandwich person, and when I had a Little Lucca's sandwich yesterday from Burlingame, it just wasn't as good (almost tasted like I could make it at home).Very good, but not quite at 5-star status yet. Maybe after another sandwich run someday, the rating will be upgraded.*mouth waters*
With over 4000 reviews, I'm sure that whatever I write, someone else has done it, like the simpsons. In summary, I have had a few different sandwiches here and they have all been good and I look forward to trying a new one on my next visit. I always try and stop by here whenever I am in the bay.
this was a great stop for lunch in my culinary tour of sf. i tried one of their more famous ones (i forget which one, but i remember it had the dirty sauce) and it was pretty bomb diggitty.would've gone again, but the line was too long
I'll keep it simple. BEST SANDWICHES ON THIS SIDE OF THE UNIVERSE! Seriously, the only problem I have with this place is having to many delicious options to decide from. But when in doubt always make it extra dirty and add BACON! IKE FOR PREZ!!!
Awesome sandwich. I got the Bella on Dutch bread. Definitely coming back. Sandwich came out to just under $11. No tables to eat at though.
Bad ass bread. Mean toppings. The dirty sauce is tasty, but get it on a dense bread as it would make soft light bread soggy.
Ike's has expanded their stores .. starting selling lame merch .. and the quality of their food has gone way way downhill !! gone is the fun store with crazy names of sandwiches written all over the walls .. now .. a boring store with a few sandwich names on the wall ... but they have like 50 sandwiches ... how am i to pick the one i want when i cant even see the whole menu anymore ?? and the sandwiches have far less in them then before .. i know i know .. ike needs his $$ ... but comeon ... this spot use to rule
Best gluten free bread I have ever had!lines are long, but calling it in ahead of time is a great option!Staff is always recommending awesome ways to make sandwiches better!!So Good!
Ike's Place truly lives up to the hype! The menu is massive, the workers are really nice and helpful, and the food is the bomb.com!I really wish this place had more seating so I could eat half my sandwich, take a nap, eat the other half, and buy one more sandwich to take home. I'm not being fat, I'm being realistic and gas efficient. Don't judge me.Change and Menage a trios are my favorites so far. You can't go wrong with either of those sandwiches.
Ike's is about as unique as it gets. Whether its a sandwich with strange/cool ingredients in it (jalapeno poppers), or a sandwich with a name like "name of girl I'm dating", Ike's finds ways to stand out from the rest. In just a few years, Ike's has turned San Francisco's sandwich landscape on it's head, and I don't think there is another store that can touch the popularity and downright fanaticism that this store generates.I have tried a good amount of their sandwiches by now, and I think my favorites are: the Paul Reubens, the Pilgrim and the Captain Corey. Of course this could easily change at any moment considering how good they all are. I must admit, after a while the sandwiches tend to blend together, but that's because it's a IKE'S SANDWICH. It's probably their 'dirty secert sauce' that makes every sandwich uniquely Ike's.The only way to get a Ike's sandwich, in my opinion, is to CALL AHEAD. Ike's Place can get so busy that you may find yourself waiting a while, so save yourself the headache.
Love the sandwiches, but hate the cost!!!!! I spent 50 bucks for three sandwiches, 3 sodas, chips. I was pissed.
Line is ridiculous but food is worth the wait. Always call in and then pick up it alleviates the waiting!!I got the Tom Brady, which I mainly ordered because the person I was with hates Tom Brady. So it was an out of spite order but it ended up being really good. I honestly forgot what was in it but they have the descriptions on their website. The person I was with ordered a Menage A Trois which was very good. Each sandwich comes with a bag of dirty chips and a caramel apple lollipop in the bag =)I loved this place!
This place has one of the best sandwiches ever! They make their own sauces, and their own bread (Dutch crunch) is bomb! I've had the Hollywood's SF Cheesesteak and Name of the Girl I'm Dating and several bites of other sandwiches from my friends. All their sandwiches are great, and I would love to try every single one of them! I personally liked Hollywood's SF Cheesesteak better because the roast beef was soft and chewy while the Name of the Girl I'm Dating had chicken that felt a bit dry. They put more toppings into your sandwich if you ask (such as jalapenos, pickles, or banana peppers). It can seem a bit pricey since the sandwiches end up being about $11-13 but they're definitely worth trying because you'll want to come back for more!Also, they give you kettle cooked chips and caramel apple lollipop that are good compliments to the sandwich! There is no space to sit and eat at the restaurant, so consider eating at Dolores Park nearby that has a beautiful view of the SF skylines.
Whenever I'm in SF this is one of the places I always have to visit, best sandwiches I've ever had! Lines vary heavily on the time of day, I've had to wait anywhere between 5 minutes and 1.5 hours although it's always worth it every time!Sandwiches are a little bit on pricier side (10-12$ for most, some are $20) but include chips and are very filling and most importantly taste AMAZINGGG. Comes with a caramel apple lollipop too which just tops off the meal great. On the downside, there's no indoor seating there so you'll have to walk somewhere to eat it or just eat curbside. I highly recommend walking over to Dolores Park which is just a few blocks away so you can eat with a beautiful view of downtown SF in the background. Plenty of spots to sit down with a good amount of benches on the upper end of the park.For the actual food, their meat is great quality and they literally have like 100 different sandwiches you can order. Some of my favorites have been the Manage a Trois (chicken, honey, honey mustard, bbq and three cheeses), the Jessica Rabbit (Chicken, Jalapeno poppers hot sauce and ranch) and the Lex Luthor (Chicken Fried Steak, Fried Chicken, Mozzarella Sticks, Rib-Eye, cheese and French Dressing.)In short, you can't go wrong with Ike's, it's awesome!!! I wish they had one closer to me
The line may look more intimidating than before, but it moves so quickly, and the sandwiches come out hot and ready to be decimated. The Spiffy Tiffy will always have a special place in my heart, with its halal chicken, pesto, avocado, and mushrooms. Mmmm. The chips were moved behind the counter (for good reason), but the service is still great, if not faster, and the only drawback is still their prices. My cashier also refunded part of my total because I'm allergic to the peanut oil used for the chips. That's pretty hot.
I came out to Ike's place with a few friends because they were hyping it up like Flavor Flav at a Naughty by Nature concert, I was a bit skeptical because they said it was a sandwich shop, so I said what the heck and thought I'd give it a try.First of all I was starting to have a bad experience when it came to trying to find parking, boy was finding a parking spot a b*tch but I took into consideration the fact that the Castro street fair was going on, so no stars taken off for this reason.The wait was long just to order! I think I stood in line for 10-15 minutes just to grab a bag of chips and some sodas (because my friends ordered our sandwiches while we looked for parking) and the sandwiches took another 30 minutes to be made, the reason why it takes a long time to make your sandwiches is because the bread is baked fresh with their "dirty sauce" and cheese when you order it and I believe thats what makes their sandwich really good, and since there were a ton of people in line and waiting for their sandwiches I can understand why it took another 30 minutes to make our sandwich and the place is one of those hole in the wall joints.THE SANDWICH WAS THE BOMB! Yeap no doubt THE BEST sandwich I've had in my lifetime, it made me forget about the long wait oh and we snagged a table too so we really got to enjoy the sammies outside in the sunny but cold (it's SF!) weather but boy did those sandwiches warm up my empty growling tummy, mMmmm..The atmosphere was really nice and plus I got to share it with my special love on our special day 5 years baby!!! The vibe from the place is great everyone there seemed to be enjoying their day, the weather, their job, and the sandwiches, the staffs attitude was great too and I think it's really cool that Ike actually does come out and personally delivers your sandwich to you personally he really seems like a great guy. Service with a smile!I'll be back again one day but this time I will try and call in and order ahead or go during their slower time (even though I got there around 4pm). Thanks Ike!OVERALL RATING 10 STARS IF YELP LET ME!
Great sandwich. I got the Matt Cain on dutch crunch. Call ahead to avoid the wait.
Oooooh! So THIS is Ike's Place. It's always on the Yelp home page; every time I sign into Yelp, I see Ike's Place in that "Best of Yelp" list. Glad I finally got around to eating here.Came here to grab dinner after SF Pride festivities, and what a perfect day to eat right outside this little hole-in-the-wall of a restaurant. It's always nice during Pride weekend = thanks, weather gods!So, yeah, I liked this place. Why? Aite, here we goes:HELLS YEAH:+ I got the Papa Sam sandwich, which was so tasty that I ate up the whole thing in a blink. It had grilled salmon (perfectly cook FTW!), "dirty suace" (some type of unidentifiable creamy concoction), and your expected trimmings (lettuce, tomatoes, bell peppers, etc.). The bread was AMAZING; it was crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and made that characteristic crunch sound that I LOVE. The salmon was great. Just, overall, a well-made sandwich in all respects.+ This is really such a little neighborhood gem, nestled right between the Mission and the Castro, so it's close to Dolores Park as well as all the stuff in the Castro/Mission. Very much a neighborhood establishment.+ The set-up is cute. It's like a little shack, and there's random, mismatched tables and chairs outside. It's a wonderful mess of furniture and props, but I dig it. + They give you a LOLLIPOP with the sandwich! I don't like lollipops anymore, but the concept is really cutesweet, isn't it? Lollipops, to me, are happiness generators. I mean, if you get a random lollipop with your meal, how can you not smile, right? Unless you're a heartless bastard, this should do the trick.+ They let me use their bathroom. Okay, that's probably a lame reason to give props to a place, but I don't know if they normally let people use it since it's basically a storage closet. But I asked the dude making the sandwiches, and he was nice, said something cute, and pointed the way. Thank you.NAW:- Mmm. . .well, I guess this really isn't so bad, but I think I would characterize this as one of those "expensive sandwich" places. $8/sandwich, which is okay if that's all you're eating for dinner. It's cheap eats-ish, but relatively, that's kinda expensive for a sandwich. But I suppose considering everything else going for this place, this is just a small complaint.Final word: They have a great variety of sandwiches. We noticed they had a POTATO CHIP sandwich too! Although, I'm not sure if I would pay money to buy something with just potato chips and trimmings since I could easily make that at home. But yeah, they's got the goods. I hear the veggie meatball sandwich is good, you should try that. The salmon one I got was delicious too, also highly recommended. Aite, it's 2am now. I'm out.
Delicious! I had a Wario with added onion rings. Omggggg. Everyone needs to experience this place. I will be back. The portions are good, you'll be nice and full when you finish. I recommend the vegan meat even for meat eaters. You won't be disappointed!
Love their sandwiches! Ordered the Menage a trois & the Matt Cain. Whoa! bomb sandwiches, just wish they put up a stand up bench or something so customers can eat standing up.
amazing sandwiches. The line gets long so call and order ahead. I recommend this place to everyone i know that comes to SF from out of town.
I love Ike's! I feel like their original San Francisco shop just gets a little better every time I pop in. The staff is friendly and helpful even when they're swamped. The sandwiches are inventive combinations that make sense, leaving you wondering why no one else has thought of this or that sandwich before. Breads are always fresh and the 'wiches are never dry and a little messy -- just right.
The last time eating their super delicious sandwiches was at the old location across the street. We ordering early when they open and the sandwiches were ready in 15 minutes! The SF Giants was a incredible combination of turkey, bacon, mushroom, avocado on a dutch crunch roll. Freshness and being a hot sandwich makes this a winner.
Love Ike's :)
The bomb! Enough said! You know this place is good when there is ALWAYS a line! Miss you, Ike!
Amazing unique sandwiches - great crunch bread and even greater toppings!
I came here today for the first time ever, and am SO happy that I did!!I ordered the Nacho Girl (wild salmon burger, avocado, mushrooms, havarti, dirty sauce, lettuce, and tomato). AMAZING! Plus free chips and a caramel apple lollipop.There's no tables to sit at inside or outside (someone who works there will tell you to get up and move if you sit down outside), so I walked to a nearby bench on Sanchez Street. The food was well worth the wait in a very long line and well worth the price tag. I can't wait to return! I would have loved to leave feedback on the web site, but was not provided with a review code in my bag. :(
I found another winner thanks to YELP.All the sandwiches are toasted with this garlic sauce &amp; you also get a complimentary tootsie pop for desert. We actually came here during the week, so we didn't have to wait in a long line. Staff was great...provided suggestions and were very laid back. I ordered the "name of the girl i'm dating" sandwich, which consists of Halal Chicken Breast, Honey Mustard, Avocado, & PepperJack. But i didn't want the honey mustard, so he suggested the "Eli Manning" instead, which includes the halal chicken, but with avocado and mushroom with a garlic and herb sauce. The freaky part is....it comprised of all of my favorite ingredients all in that one sandwich!!!! It was like he was reading my mind...YUMMO.All in all...FANTASTIC sandwich. A definite must try if you're in the castro area. Don't expect a fancy sit-down diner....there are tables outside, and if you're lucky, you might catch a seat.
Oh my goodness! Ike's is the best little sandwich shop. We got a couple different sandwiches and each one was delicious! This place is extremely busy. Parking is hard to find but you just have to circle the blocks a few times and there is no place to sit down but you have your car to eat in.
Loitering hipsters, friendly employees, AMAZING sandwiches, chips that come with said sandwiches, and caramel apple lollipop included?? YES PLEASE. Just pay your ~$12 and settle yourself in the small waiting area.For my first time at Ike's I got the Menage-a-Trois on Dutch Crunch. Apparently the Funky Fusion chips are the best ones, but I had the Sea Salt & Vinegar - pretty good too. They cut it in half for you pointy-style and wrap it in nice paper. The sandwich itself was juicy and had a sweet tangy taste - gets kind of messy but WORTH IT. Downsides:-$12 is a big pricey for a sandwich, but at least they're pretty decently sized-The place is small and you kind of have to all squeeze into line and then squeeze into the waiting area. Seems to be always packed. I've heard good things about the Matt Cain, so that is definitely on my to-try list for next time!
There's a reason why there are so many great reviews. The sandwiches were so good we went twice during a 4 day trip to SF. We had a Menage a trois and Madison Baumgartner on Dutch Crunch the first time. Both were fantastic! We came back for the Kryptonite. It may have been a little too much meat for the wife, and the fried items get a little soggy, but it was tasty nonetheless. It is my opinion that bread usually makes the biggest impact on sandwiches and Ike's is no exception. The dirty sauce/meat/cheese flavor combinations make this place 5 stars all by itself, but the texture and flavor of the Dutch Crunch bread elevate these sandwiches to make Ike's worthy of the all of the reviews and praise it receives.
It seems redundant at this point, given all their reviews, but indeed, this is the best damned sandwich place I've ever been to. Their sauce makes a great sandwich to die for. If you like a good sandwich, and haven't been there yet, this is indeed the place to go!
I am in LOVE with this place!!!! Best sandwiches ever!!! Although, you may have to call several times as they seem to always be super busy. Other than that, totally worth the wait!
Ike's is the best!! There's a reason why it's the second most reviewed business on Yelp. It's a sensation and local favorite. I've been here twice and will continue to come here many other times. The sandwiches are top notch. You cannot go wrong with whichever one you order. I've tried the spiffy tiffy and the hot mamma huda, serious awesomeness! These sandwiches are going to be around $10, very filling, come with kettle chips and a green apple caramel lollipop. You will have finished your chips by the time the sandwich is ready. Workers here are very nice and give good recommendations. Have to wait 10, 20, 30min in line? Who cares, do it. You won't be disappointed. Please open more Ike's around the city!
What can I say but YUMMMMY!!!!  The sandwich was HUGE!
There are a few places I will vouch for, and this sandwich place is one of them.[Name of the girl I'm dating] Sandwich on dutch crunch w/ everything minus pickles.Add a Empire root beer to top it off! and tip the phenomenal workers.I declare it the best I ever had.
The Vegetarian Mike and the Damon Bruce was just okaybut OMG the Menage a Trois was so good and I don't even like chicken sandwiches!!
I love this place. My first impression was the Menage A Trois (BBQ, Cheddar, Halal Chicken, Honey Mustard, Pepper Jack, Real Honey, Swiss) It was so deliciously juicy. The sandwich comes with a bag of chips (voddoo is my personal favorite) and a carmel apple lollipop. Come when you have time to spare. The line can get pretty long. I can't wait to go again and try their many many other sandwiches!
I love Ike's!!!! I go to SFSU and we now have an Ike's on campus :) The sandwhiches are different and really tasty. The bread is delicious! I met Ike when I went to this location, he's a really nice man! He's a great business owner and cares about his customers. We had a conversation for about 10 minutes and he was genuinely interested in me and my friends!
Ikes is the best specialty sandwich place ive ever had. He is a true culinary genius. The wait can be alil bit annoying sometimes but well worth it. Plus with his social networking you he really cares about his customers.
If this place isn't as hyped as it is (said to be the best sandwich ever), I would have given it 4 stars. But since it is so hyped, I must be really impressed. For $10 I expect a bigger sandwich. I had the Matt Cain, from what I hear is up for the best sandwich in the country. It was a small to medium size sandwich at best. Don't get me wrong, this was delicious, but for the price and the hype, i am not sure. I may have ordered the wrong thing, but if a sandwich is up for the best sandwich, i have to try it. -1 for over hype-1 for the price ($12+ for sandwhich chips and drink)I will give this place one more chance... Good thing i didn't have to wait in line.
This place is AWESOME for sandwiches! They defnitely know how to do it right. The wait can be a pain but it's definitely worth it.
The sandwich: an art form, the food of angels. You can never go wrong with a sandwich, and if you want to eat the greatest sandwich on the face of the earth, look no further than Ike's place!!!A few buddies and I drove to San Francisco this past weekend for a small trip, and I've been dying to try the sandwiches here since I saw them on a blog called Scanwiches. We came here at 12ish on a Thursday afternoon, no long lines, and the service was wonderful. I ordered sandwich called the cowboy curtis (ala peewee's playhouse) and it was the greatest sandwich these lips have ever tasted. The Dirty Sauce was to die for, I couldn't believe that I didn't fall to my knees and worship the sandwich gods for blessing me with such a gift. To quote Liz Lemon of 30 Rock, "all human kind has one thing in common: The sandwich. I believe all that anyone really wants in this life is to sit in peace and eat a sandwich". I feel that after eating at Ike's, this can become the motto of anyone, everywhere.
Amazing Sandwiches, Period.
Reviewing for the sake of reviewing.What can I say that the other 4000+ hasn't said.5-stars.
I came here with two lovely Yelp ladies. The INCREDIBLY friendly staff chatted us up, and recommended the Mnage  Trois: halal chicken, pepper jack, real honey, BBQ sauce, honey mustard and the works (lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, etc.).I had another "lunch" waiting for me, but what guy could resist a Mnage  Trois with two beautiful women? So the three of us got down and dirty, right there in broad daylight. Let me tell you, these girls know how to share. (I suspect this was not their first time.)This was my first Mnage  Trois, but I certainly hope it's not my last. It made me very happy.Hmm...I wonder if the girls enjoyed it as much as I did. It got pretty messy, and some people aren't down with that. Also, I must admit that the whole experience was over a bit too quickly, and I was to blame. Sometimes I can't control myself. If I lived anywhere near here, I would slowly work my way through the entire menu, because [I'm a gluttonous pig and] everything sounded phenomenal. But I fear that once you've had a Mnage  Trois, you can never go back to regular...sandwiches.
Although I am not one of their original customers from way back when, I think this place is awesome! The first time I ate here was when they were located at Lime, I have had some coworkers go out and pick one up but never have I been there until the last year or so. Every time I've left pretty satisfied. The only time I wasn't was with the Chipper's Fave. That sucked. As for the other sandwiches, I've tried Spiffy Tiffy, Menage A Trois, Elvis Keith, Nacho Boy and I've taken bites out of a few others. I'd say that my favorite goes in this order:1. Spiffy Tiffy2. Menage A Trois3. Elvis Keith (with avocado)4. Nacho Boy5. Chipper's FaveOh, and make sure you order beforehand. Standing for an hour and a half is utterly a waste of time, even with friends.
My favorite sandwich shop in the whole wide world. "Coming home for Thanksgiving" and the "menage e trois" are my favs. The subs are to die for and the staff is always super friendly. Life long customer!!!
What else is there to say about a place that has 3300+ reviews? Ended up trying this place for the first time because Liz T. had a coupon (possibly a groupon?) that was buy 2 and get the 3rd sandwich FREE! yay!Im a fatty, so what. =DBTW, don't plan on dining in, this place stays pretty crowded and the only seating is a long bench by the store window.
Being from Pennsylvania, I consider myself a bit of a sandwich expert. My wife has been after me to try Ike's, but have been to stubborn to accept that a good sandwich can come out of the west coast. Boy, was I wrong! There's a long line stretch out the door, but the sandwich was well worth the wait. Bread is fresh and the meats and sauce are quite flavorful. Definite go again!
Great sandwiches! I love the Hot Mama Huda and the Matt Cain.
Dear Ike's,I know you already have 3,000+ reviews, but I would just like to say that you are the best sandwich I have ever put in my mouth (Matt Cain with Onion Rings on dutch crunch). Yes, you heard me right.. I have committed... you are the sandwich for me! I believe this is what it feels like when you have met "The One".Love,Alison
This place is Awesome. I lost the number of times I came here to grab a bite, most of a time a different sandwich. Ike's is very creative with sandwiches, with the combinations of ingredients, and names. Ike Shehadeh and the other workers are extremely nice and friendly, helpful, giving recommendations and complimenting your choice. Any sandwich here would be a good choice. I highly recommend for for anybody from casual customers to tourists.
The five stars are based on a couple things for me: 1) A damn good sandwich on some amazingly fresh bread and 2) I had the pleasure of enjoying Ike's because they donated sandwiches to Walk Against Rape, put on by San Francisco Women Against Rape. And that - to me - is truly what is very cool about this local fave. I got to eat a half of a classic ham and cheese, as well as a vegetarian, and I was surprised at how yummy they each were. Seriously, I wasn't expecting much until I had the first bite. Woah. And they support the community with free sammies for an amazing cause. Pfff. Ike is my hero.
Mnage  trois.Peter D (Brooklyn)Colleen C (Chicago)Farrah A (Houston)Kidding, it's the name of the sandwich...sickos. ;)And what a fine sandwich it was. Hot, gooey, chickeny, honey mustardy, crispy lettuce, soft bread....mmmmm, round of applause. This threesome was a hit!Great service. Small seating (all outdoors). FANTASTIC list of inventive sammies. Get saucy.
I would have to say one of the best spots in SF to grab a good sandwich on the go!
FANTASTIC! wish there was one closer to me in hayward.
Stopped by here to get sandwiches for a picnic. Fantastic. My daughter & I loved the "Sometimes I'm a vegetarian" I added avocado to mine. All unique names of the sandwiches. Wish we had one of these in Atlanta! For meat lovers & vegetarians. Lots to choose from. Highly recommend.
Best sandwiches in the city, actually in the country!! So delicious, its like a party in your mouth with all the wonderful flavors mingling!! Doesn't matter what you get- you will be pleased and completely satisfied!! Now if only they would deliver all over the city for all of us using public transportation to get everywhere!!...think about it Ike!!
My boyfriend came home one day after work with the Kryptonite sandwich and I looked at him like he was crazy. That sandwich is loaded with avocado, bacon, onion rings, ham, mozzarella sticks, pastrami, pesto, stuffed jalapenos...I know there is more but I can't remember what else. I thought that that would be way too many different flavors for one sandwich but I took a couple bites and surprisingly liked it. Definitely would not recommend eating the Kryptonite everyday though.
If you're a vegetarian that craves meat every once in a while I recommend their veggie/vegan sandwiches. Amazing faux-turkey/chicken/etc
best sandwiches! really psyched they do gluten free! really glad they carry Zapp's chips! wish they had more seating though. but you can't win em all.
4 words: Dutch Crunch. Dirty Sauce. ALL DAY EVERYDAY. Haven't been? GO! NOW! RUN, DON'T WALK. yea, YOU! i said NOW! Delicious sandwiches. If i could shove each kind sandwich down my throat, I would....but alas...my stomach is not big enough. If one day I become a bazillionaire, I'm going to purchase one of every combination of sandwich that can be made...and feed the world. I bet each person will probably have a different one. lol.
LOVE THIS PLACE! The sandwiches here are awesome! My only complaint? I can't finish the sandwiches in one go! They're so good, but fill you up fast!
There once was story about a guy named Ike who created this monster marketing machine, and used it to promote his Sandwiches. You may ask yourself, how did I get here?What's good for Ike's is good for the countryUnlike major brands, his sandwiches are not bland, Ike's sandwiches are the most creative assemblages of meat, veggies, bread, sauce & some other special surprises that you won't find on a sandwich anywhere...Ain't nothing like em nowhereSo here you have this killer sandwich shop that markets their sandwiches like Apple markets iPods. Maybe they do, maybe they don't but their FOOD BACKS IT UP!Yeah you might have to stand in line, BUT YOU DON"T, cause there's an app for that... You might be one that is bored at sandwich shop after sandwich shop....Ike, he thought about people like you. So he created the ENCHANTED FOREST of sandwich menu's. Visit again and again and you'll keep finding out about more options and more sandwiches unlocking Menu additions like your'e in Super Mario land and soon you'll have eaten the entire menu... Maybe.....Cause Ike will find you and he'll say this one has eaten all of my sandwiches and better than a Mayorship at 4SQ, you'll like get his VIP card.Or he might ask you what you like, and if your sandwich is appealing, and add it to the menu, he might name it after you, where else can you rock that?Soon you'll think running for Mayor of the City is just a mere hurdle to the Presidency and you'll look back and say it all started at Ike's...
Love their sandwhiches!! esp the gluten free bread which is really delicious! and Ike is super friendly and nice too!
Mmmm grhhmmmm waargghmmmThose were the only words I could manage after diving into the Lex Luther. Chicken fried steak and chicken, ribeye, american cheese, fried moz sticks and french dressing in a sourdough roll. It's like a fried chicken, philly cheesteak and southern breakfast meat were thrown into the ring and decided to make a sandwich baby rather than fight. Also had the Menage, which was good, but nowhere near the LLCall in your order ahead of time to avoid the wait.
The sandwiches here are amazing! The selection is so huge that the full menu is online because it does not all fit on the menu wall. A great San Francisco treat if you're visiting the city. And locals, you could never get bored of this place. Things to know: There's no place to sit and enjoy your sandwich, but its cute to get your things and go find a cute place in the city to sit and eat (maybe a public eatery on Valencia). While well worth the price, I don't know if i agree with the $ category it was placed under on yelp. the sandwiches are, at cheapest, around ten bucks each and go up from there, and then they have chips and drinks for sale, so unless you are sharing, it comes out to almost $20 per person. But like i said, the sandwiches are amazing.
Great place to grab a fancy sandwich. Many types to pick from so many you will def want to go back soon for that other sandwich you wanted but didn't get. FYI around lunch the line is HUGE.
yummy. i had a fun time with my son eating our sandwiches on the curb. but NO place is worth waiting in a line like that.. it's a sure sign that it's time to go find the next yummy place ..
BEST SANDWICHES IN THE WORLD.No other place makes a sandwich so big and so good! I'm a quantity guy, but when you dubbaaaa on the quantity and it doesn't lose flavor, you get IKES. I got the kryptonite and i can't even remember how many ingredients were in it (i think 13). 5 pounds of heaven, and i ate it in one hefty sitting. Satisfaction guaranteed, so glad it's in my hometown.
Simply the best.
Pilgrim on Dutch Crunch mm mm mm. if you try and eat while standing on the sidewalk an employee with a nametag sticker will scold you FYI. you have to go around the corner ha ha ha
Man their sandwiches are good. I've never had a bad one off their menu.
Holy cow! I got the "Sometimes I'm a vegetarian" and added the vegan turkey and it was amazing! If you take this down to the park, definitely grab some extra napkins though.
No wait on a tuesday morning when they have just opened shop. I had the spiffy tiffy and it was a sandwich like none other! It definitely changed my philosophy of sandwiches. The sandwich is sizable and they'll slice it in half for you. All their sandwiches are delicious, so trading your second half is recommended.They've moved from their original location, but this location has more space.Don't get too excited, there's only more space to wait. There is no place to sit and eat, so take your brown lunch bag and your chips and walk to the park nearby.  If the place is jam-packed and you've been forced to wait on the sidewalk, don't stand or sit on anyone's doorstep.
Ike's never ceases to amaze me. Their sandwiches as so delicious! I've always gotten the Matt Cain, and never once regretted my decision. All the ingredients taste so fresh. Their dutch crunch rolls are to die for by the way. If you haven't tried Ike's sandwiches you honestly are doing yourself dirty.
Love the menage a trois. Perhaps the perfect sandwich!
Ike's has plenty of reviews so this is more for my personal digital diary as it were.The Menage is not bad, I normally don't like chicken for a sandwich ingredient (usually dry) but there's so much going on with the cheeses and the dirty sauce; definitely a great sammich.The Nacho Boy is prolly my fav. Roast beef, Mushrooms, avocado, and cheese. This is my ideal sandwich next to a good ole' fashioned prosciutto. (For those who don't eat beef, the SF giants is similar but they use turkey instead. Also a very good sammich).And yes, I've tried the Kryptonite! It's got everything plus the kitchen sink in it. The taste is awesomely strange and overwhelming but the sammich is just too much physically! It's quite daunting. I'm glad I tried it with some friends but I won't order it again.Great SF flavor, great service, I just wish they had some seating so we didn't always have to eat in the car...
Excellent sandwiches, fair prices and so many different topping options -- everyone will find something they love at Ike's. As for me? It's their Thanksgiving sandwich (cranberry sauce bias).
Arguably the best Sandwich on the face of the earth!No wonder this place is on 7x7 100 Eats before you die. There's always a long line, and there are so many phone calls with this place. My favorite sandwiches:Hollywood's San Francisco Cheesesteak[Name of Girl I'm Dating]KryptoniteWhen I'm at Lime, there are people in the restaurant eating the sandwiches near the bar. Its great to pick up your sandwiches here and then take them to Dolores Park and sit on the grass.
Not big on sandwiches, but this place is definitely good.I've been a couple times ... love the concept of King Koopa. I mean, how can you go wrong when you put so many of my favorite things (meatballs, mozzorella sticks, jalapeno peppers) in one easy to eat package? As much as I enjoyed this monster of a sammich, I actually preferred Mike's choice: Matt Cain. Something was just SOOO good about it.  It totally reminded me of the gargantuan from Jimmy Johns. DROOL. Thinking about it is making me hungry :/ Anyway, I never really made it a point to come here. Most of the time I was just going because everyone else wanted to ... but now I think I'll be going of my own volition ... all for that Matt Cain.
Great Sandwich spot with amazing and creative selections, however, there is usually a line out the door. Worth it though. Plus, any place that sells Zapp's (authentic Lousianna chips), definitely knows what good food is.
omg. i'm so glad i found this place on yelp. the sandwiches are amazing here. pricey, yes.. but definitely worth the $7 i didn't know what to order, so i asked the register guy was his favorite was... and he was so helpful, there was a line, and he still took the time to tell me all his favorites.. he recommended something that wasn't on the menu.. chicken sandwich, with real honey and BBQ sauce.. weird combo, but so delicious! my honey got some meaty sandwich with a whole bunch of meat in it.. definitely good.. the only problem, there isn't much seating.. only 4 tables outside.. and a couple chairs.. they seem really busy and should definitely invest in some more tables =)
Ok, who am I kidding? After having been back to Ike's a few times, I realized I never updated my review. Between this and Deli Board, far and away my favorite places to go for sandwiches in the Bay Area. Grab some Ike's, walk to Dolores Park, and enjoy life. Do it.
A wide selection of super tasty sandwiches. The line out the door on any given day corroborates this.
Ike's is as good as everyone says!They have so many delicious choices it's hard to make a decision. The lines can be long but not too bad if you go early on a weekday.The dirty sauce is so tasty and everything is wondefully fresh.  I only wish it were closer to my house.Great service too, the employees seem to enjoy working there.
There's a reason this place has more yelp reviews than any other place in the country other than 1. It's really f'n good!I, like most people, am always enamored with a good sandwich. Yet they're hard to find. You can grab a sandwich anywhere but something truly good and unique is hard to find. While we were in the city we made it a point to go check this place out. We split a manage a trois and a super mario for our drive back home to Sacramento. I was worried they'd be a little messy to eat while driving but they were ok. Just lay the butcher paper across your lap to catch the shrapnel. I started with my half of the super mario. This was heaven. I think my favorite sandwich is a good meatball sub. It's definitely in the top 5. This may be the best I've ever had. The meatballs were tender and flavorful with a real meaty flavor. They didn't taste frozen or processed at all. The sauce wasn't too heavy to smother the other flavors but was more of an accent. The piece de resistance was the mozzarella sticks and the garlic spread. So good and so perfect all wrapped together between 2 soft pieces of bread. The manage a trois was really something special too. The chicken was juicy. The honey, honey mustard, and bbq sauces were a great combo together with the chicken. And the cheeses took the overly sweetness that could've been with all the honey and gave some savoriness to it. Both sandwiches I would happily order again or I would choose from 1 of the other 40 choices they had!
Ike has become an addiction... My husband loves to stop there once a week.. And I love the fact they use halal meat.
Ike's Place is in my Top 3 "Most Mind-Blowing, Life Changing, Holy-Shit-I-Could-Die-Right-Now" Sandwich Spots! The Menage-a-Trois with bacon makes my heart melt! Just writing this review makes me want to jump on the next flight out...
Really interesting sandwich combos and sauces! Very friendly service. Be prepared for long lines -- but does move quickly.
What is a must-do in SFO? Turns out it's a sandwich from Ike's Place eaten in Dolores Park, or so says my pal from Cincy. So, on his word, I left my hostel at 711 Post and headed in search of Ike's Place. My trusty Yelp app (lovingly dubbed The Yapp by Calgarian Yelper Tara M) told me it was but a mere 2.4 kms. That would put me there within about 30 mins or so, a little less if I didn't encounter too many hills. As I'm navigating through the streets of SF, my eye takes note of a little something in my trusty Yapp. Mysteriously, the distance has changed from 2.4 kms to 2.4 mi. Or rather, my eyes have stopped seeing what they want to see and I realize I'm walking 2.4 mi for a sandwich. WHAT??? Already half way there, I'm not about to turn around. Once I set my mind on something, I'm not stopping until I get there. It's part of my charm ;). Cincy had better be right about this sandwich.When I arrived, it was around 1115, and already crawling with people. Yowzah! I order a Paul Reubens (Pastrami, Home Made Poppy Seed Coleslaw, French Dressing, Swiss) on SF sourdough with lettuce, tomato and red onion. It's maybe a 10 minute wait before my sandwich is ready to accompany me out the door. With a ginger beer and a bag'o'crisps under arm, me and Paul Reubens head to the park for a saucy encounter of the sandwich kind.I will admit, Paul Reubens was a little large for me to handle. His extra sauce squeezed out the sides of his wrapper as I bit into layers of drool-worthy meat. I had trouble with my last few nibbles, and he kept me stuffed pretty much the rest of the day. But man oh man, that's one sandwich I won't ever forget.
The best place in the city to get a sandwich. They have so many varieties and it's perfect for vegans and vegetarians as well! Just make sure you call in advance so you don't have to wait in line for too long to eat!
Great sandwiches. Fun atmosphere. Thrilled that they're in Walnut Creek!!
Boy oh boy I wanted to trash this place. People in CA dont know squat about 2 things: pizza and subs (and please please please don't reference your shitmunch local SF pizza joint and waste my time, just accept the fact unless you've lived in the east coast). Nope this place was really good...no east coast sub, but this was a damn good sandwich. We each got vege subs (the meatball and the womanizer)...they were soooo good I was shocked. No hippy BS, they were flavorful and tasty. Will def go back if I want a bite, and with tons of options this place can't get old. Learned my lesson to order ahead for pickup. The only downside: why open to 7pm on weekdays? That's an odd time to close.
Prepare to use a lot of napkins.After taking a look at Marti L. photos on Facebook, I said I'm getting me some sandwiches today. The only dumb thing was that I asked my employees if they wanted anything. I told them to order me a sandwich and for them to order whatever they want. They called me back and said the sandwiches should be ready by 130. Perfect.Parked right outside and I said hot damn!!!! I am lucky today!!!! Went inside and said I'm here to pick up and she said perfect because my order is complete. HOT DAMN AGAIN!!! Brought out 50 dollars and expected change. She goes.............your total is 105.50 sir. ahhahahaha. Good one!!! Those guys got me at work.So..............we ordered.Spiffy TiffyChangeKryptoniteDoomsdaySupermanJim Rome'sIt was tough, but I had a quarter of every single sandwich and all didn't disappoint. Every single sandwich was delicious. I would probably get the Change and Superman. The Doomsday just had a pile of meat. I don't think I had any bread to go with the meat. hahaha.Excellent!!!
Ikes is fantastic. You already know this. I wish the sweeter sandwiches weren't so cloyingly sweet.
Heard A LOT of things about this place, so I decided to finally try it. Place was packed, as expected, and there are soooo many choices. I was recommended the Menage a trios, although the Damon Bruce looked good, I got the menage a trios, w/ Dutch Crunch. I think if you get a drink, you also get a free bag of chips. The sandwich was pretty good. All the sauces put together, made everything taste nice. I would definitely go back here again.
I came on a Monday around 1pm and the wait was not as bad as everyone said it was. I was expecting to wait 40+minutes but I only waited no more than 15 minutes to order. *score*I got the Spiffy Tiffy which has the halal chicken, mushrooms, avocado, pesto, provolone and pepper jack. I added lettuce and red onions on dutch crutch of course. It was good, but my friends over hyped this place so it didn't meet my super high expectations. Don't get me wrong, the sandwich was great, but I think I'll have to come back and try their other sandwiches.The sandwich also comes with a bag of chips which is a plus.As for the facility, the place was clean and the workers were efficient. The only thing I didn't like was that the full menu was not up. On their website, they have a bazillion types of sandwiches. I just wished they had a paper copy of it when I was there inside the shop. Also, there is no tables for you to enjoy your sandwich, only a few chairs. When it's a nice day out, I don't mind walking to Dolores park to eat there, but on a ugly foggy day, I would want a place to sit down. But it's not their fault they don't have enough space to accommodate us sandwich lovers...
Sandwich is awesome and knowing the owners brother is a plus. I want to try all the sandwiches!
My vegetarian "Jim Rome" might have been the best sandwich I've ever had! Granted, I was hungry, but I had always thought there was a sandwich ceiling - meaning that there was only a certain level of goodness a sandwich can reach before it plateaus. Ike's broke that ceiling by piling a good amount of vegan turkey, avocado, cheddar, and red pesto into a fresh warm dutch crunch roll generously slathered with dirty sauce. The sandwiches have just the perfect amount of filling it in (i.e. it's not overstuffed with mediocre fillings that squirt out everywhere) so that you can taste each ingredient separately. Oh my goodness!I suggest looking at the website beforehand to get an idea of what you want. The posted menu in the store only has a fraction of the combos available online.
Can't believe it took me so long to come but SO happy I did.Called in my order because I heard the wait can be long sometimes, and my order was ready 15 minutes later when I got there. It was a Saturday night though and the line was still only 3-4 people.I honestly came on a whim and picked the Change - thinly sliced rib eye, bbq, onion rings, cheddar.Let me tell you, I hate bbq sauce. Whatever I don't care what you think, I hate it. It just covers up the flavor of whatever meat you're eating and it just tastes like a bottle of mesquite smoke and it's usually overwhelmingly sweet.But this sandwich was so good, and I actually LIKED the bbq sauce. There wasn't too much sauce, perfect amount to keep the sandwich moist and the meat was really juicy. YUM.Definitely coming back as soon as I'm back in Castro - currently eyeing the Joker or Lux Lexor. Don't judge me.
Ikes. What a great idea while on holiday in San Fran! What we wanted were healthy, ingredient packed sandwiches. We read the yelps, oh man they even have alfalfa and TONS OF VEGGIE options. We got them sandwiches... after 3 hours of trouble. Multiple trips to local coffee shops to feed our meter. After complaining about the terrible service, a staff member told us we only waited 90 minutes (from the time the order was put in to the current time). After the most inefficient ordering system (phone in versus long line outside that gets cut by phone ins) I guess it took us an hour and a half to even get the order in the computer.Never again Ikes! We got the sandwiches, big, full of ingredients, after a wasted afternoon in Frisco, they were cold and we were mad.
My girlfriend and I were speding our three day weekend in San Francisco, and she insisted that we must go to Ike's. It was about one in the afternoon when we got in line for Ike's. There was a long line coming out of the store and into the streets. At first, the wait wasn't too bad because we were too distracted trying to decide on a sandwich from the hundreds on the menu. But then the wait became more and more ridiculous. When we finally submitted our order and paid the cashier, I was so relieved and excited until he said that it will be about another half-hour wait for the food. -_-. It was about 2:30 when we got our sandwiches.There are many things worth waiting 90 minutes for. An Ike's sandwich is not one of them. Don't get me wrong, the sandwich was great, but not worth the wait and a rather hefty price for a sandwich.It's a shame there isn't a Which Wich in the SF area.P.S.: Ordering ahead by phone will save you a ton of time.
I have to get a sandwich here everytime I visit SF!
Awesome sandwiches! They all sound amazing.
I have to say... besides the extra dirty sauce (which was everything I was told about), I expected a lot more from Ike's based on their general reputation, fame and recommendations from friends. That's not to say it was bad, or even just ok, by any means... My Matt Cain was delicious and I like how you are left on your own to choose whatever bag of chips you want while you wait (including Funky Fusion, which I'm told is not available in stores). Also, big ups on the service. The friendly people at the register and pickup are eager to help first-timers with their selections. Not rough on the eyes either, but that's just a superficial note I'm throwing in. All in all, a great sandwich place with a lot of personality!
I feel like an idiot for giving this place three stars, but I definitely wasnt as wow-ed as i thought i'd be after all the hype.After flipping through their list of 100 sandwiches in their book (not menu, BOOK), I settled on the Papa Sam (wild salmon burger with wild sauce and cheese), which is also featured on their wall menu. The wait took a while, but that didnt come as a surprise considering how busy the small restaurant was.I was insanely hungry, so the first bite into any type of food felt good, but flavor and taste doesnt really register for me. The overwhelming satisfaction of putting substance into my stomach over looks any quality of the food. After half way into my first half of the sandwich, i realized there wasnt anything in particular about it that struck me. I liked that the bread was nice and crispy, there was a good amount of salmon in the sandwich, and the whole thing was just covered in grease. Other than that, nothing... not even the sauce.The thing that went wrong for me was choosing a salmon sandwich. The lightness and quality of the salmon just didnt seem to accompany the heavy dirty sauce. If you're going to go to a heavy sandwich place, you might as well go all out and go for a heavy meat sandwich. Leave the salmon with a side of broccoli for dinner, and indulge in a chicken sandwich, or even the superman here. I definitely have to come back for one of those, or even the meatball sandwich that my friend raved about.
3000+ reviews? Yeah, it's that good!My friends and I decided to head over to Ike's before some brunch activities at Lime (crazy, I know). I had the Jim Rome (turkey, red pesto, avocado, and cheddar) on Dutch crunch. Man oh man... so good! That bread is delicious!!! After just half of that sandwich I was stuffed!Dirty chips with purchase?? Sign me up. And that caramel apple pop brought back the good ol days...I love Ike's!
This is LONG OVERDUE, but better now than never, right?Looking for a casual place in the city to eat for lunch with ze bee-eff, I stumbled on Ikes after a 1000+ reviews. With the ridiculous amount of feedback about a humble sandwich shop, I figured I had nothing to lose, right? After one bite out of my Paul Ruben sandwich with Dutch Crunch, I was in shock. Normally when I hear sandwich, I don't see it as something spectacular other than to satisfy hunger pangs, but HOLY CRAP it was so good! I could try to elaborate more on why it was so delicious and all, but I can't...it was just AWESOME. This makes me for sad that Sactown doesn't have anything close to that. *Cry*.A couple of months later, I was visiting a city to see a dear friend who recently moved there, and along with my boyfriend, we headed down to Ikes againand decided to expand his knowledge of the city a lit better.Once again I ordered a Paul Reuben, as well as the Matt Cain for the boyfriend (which is also really awesome as well), and we both decided to switch half to try it out. When it came time to get my order, it was none other than Ike himself that delivered it to me. I may have gotten a little excited and had a ridiculous grin on my face-plus I was starving as well, so I'll blame it on that.Ike: You ordered the Paul Reuben and Matt Cain?Me: Yes I did!Ike: Those are my favorite sandwiches on the menu. You chose really well! Saving one for later?Me: *laughs* The Cain is for the boyfriend-Ike: Nahhh, just keep it for yourself. You really don't need to, do you?Awesome sandwiches with a down to earth and awesome owner. That is a WINNING combo right there.
Best sandwich in town. I hate lines and I will go to another place if there's a long line ... but not for Ike's because it so worth every second of waiting. You get a sandwich, a bag of Dirty's chips, and a Caramel Apple lollipop all for the price of one. LOVE my Dirty's Jalapeno Heat Chips!I usually order the Matt Cain while the bf orders a different one each time. I can never finish the whole sandwich in one sitting so it doubles as lunch and snack/pre-dinner - SCORE!Ike's also gives out BOGO coupons throughout the year (including a birthday gift). Gotta love a place that appreciate their customers and know how to keep them coming back.TIP: Remember to check their website for more sandwich choices. They only list the most popular ones on the blackboard in -store.
Got lucky and the line wasn't too bad. MENAGE A TROIS   $11halal chicken, honey, bbq sauce, honey mustard, swiss, cheddar & pepper jack. #125 (I think that's the #) $10turkey, bacon, avocado. The Menage a Trois was the better of the two. Make sure you get your sandwiches on their famous Dutch Crunch bread. Crunchy and chewy all in one. The sandwiches are a good size and filling! If you can sucker a friend to go with you so you can split 2 sandwiches!!
I went to Ike's place earlier this week, and it was amazing. Great sandwich (and the side chips were amazing- definitely get the Voodoo flavor). The service was good, and my girlfriend and I went to Dolores to eat our sandwiches.
Great customer service .very good sandwiches I had the breaded chicken with ranch and yellow bbq sauce it was tasty cant wait to go back and try another .so many sandwices its awsome .
I'm not that into sandwiches, but these were good. The dill flavored chips were excellent though. It's cool that you can add mozzarella sticks and stuffed jalapeos.
As far as all the bad reviews on here goes, I figure they're all about the wait and go back as far as the hype started, and lines were ridiculous. All in all I feel reviews should stay on the topic of FOOD and SERVICE. Both of which, was amazing for my first time visit to Ike's yesterday. I've only heard of Ike's on Man vs Food and never thought to check the Yelp, since my friend suggested we go there on the day I and some friends was visiting her. I had a Backstabber (chicken with caesar dressing) with avocados added, and my boyfriend had a We're just friends (interesting combination for us two right? haha). The line was surprisingly quick for a saturday late lunch, maybe 10 minutes. The young lady at the cashier was super energetic, and extremely friendly to talk to :). I was overwhelmed so I asked her for suggestions on bread for the backstabber, and she suggested sourdough without hesitation, so it sounded like a winner ! I would have otherwise tried the dutch crunch but they were out :(. The wait was a little long, maybe 20-30 minutes, but it was pretty pleasant and we managed to grab a bench. I was happy to see signs asking the customers not to sit on neighborhood stoops, very considerate seeing their past relationships with the neighborhood. Went to dolores park to eat, and I had the first bite of my backstabber...HOLY COW, it was so good! It was phenomenal, I can't explain! Just the overall melding of flavors made me have to take a big breath. So yummy ! Paired with the jalapeno dirty chips, all of the sandwiches my friends and I had were so good, and we established that we'll be getting Ike's every time we're in SF. My friend even said if she won the 1000 free sandwich contest Ike's having, she would drive to SF for a sandwich.. heck I would too ! My suggestion, put avocado on the backstabber! It added a creaminess that was super yummy. part of my sandwich that didnt have avocado, emphasized on the chicken but felt incomplete ! Can't wait to go back !
Finally got to see what all the hype was about. Saw Ike's on Food Network and have been trying to try Ike's everytime I'm on that side of town. Soooo, me and the Fiance at the time (he was not Husband yet), had just left Salon Baobao, and saw that Ike's had moved to Lime.We decided to get some Ike's. Hubster got a Nacho Boy and I got Barry B.'s. The sandwiches were okay but not mind blowing. The bacon on mine was crispy which was nice, but overall, both sandwiches were too salty, too much filling, too much waiting therefore too much sogginess, so overall too much hype. I say go to Lou's in the Richmond.
My friend and I purposely came here for the Scoutmob deal. We got the Elvis - halal chicken with wasabi mayo. I love sandwiches that are crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside, so their sandwiches were top notch. The chicken was also delicious and tender. It definitely complimented well with a hint of wasabi. I wish there was more stuffing in the sandwich. Maybe I'll have to go back for a full size sammie now.
Unique and tasty sandwiches... delicious!
I'm a very picky eater and never order off a menu (yes even the 200 plus options that Ike's has) besides being an annoying eater I'm also vegetarian. Ike's never disappoints, the one time they got my order wrong (and I make it hard) they apologized sincerely and made me a new one in a flash that was correct (perfectly weird) and just want I wanted, they even added a sweet little sorry message!Honestly I've never waited too long in the lines or for my sandwich, any wait is worth it to me! If you have a problem with paying for quality, good things coming to those who wait and have an affinity to calling anything popular "hipster" you can go to Subway!
Nacho boyyyy! So bomb. It was my first time a few days ago and when I bumbled through my order the cashier was really helpful with what was recommended (she winked at me ten times after saying "Dutch Crunch bread" HAHA)This place is so cheap for what you get. Sandwiches range from $10-13, but they're big enough to share, and they come with Dirty chips (not like... they're actually dirty. That's just a name!).Although I ordered at the cashier, a lot of others phone ahead and pick up their sandwiches. There aren't places to sit inside, so it's best to just take your sandwich and walk a few blocks away to a nearby park.Bi-Rite ice cream is also nearby if you feel the need for dessert after ;)
WOW I love this place. I don't know what is in that dirty sauce, but it might as well be crack or something because it's that freakin good. This is the only place in SF where I'll crave their food.The wait can get a little long sometimes (weekend not too bad, but 1-2 hours sometimes on the weekends) so definitely phone ahead. I can eat a lot off food, but I think the challenge is physically impossible. I have had the Lex Luthor and Kyrponite. Each one has put me in a massive food coma. I've also seen the man himself, Ike, make a few appearances. =D.
It's true... once you have an Ike's sandwich, you will never look at another sandwich the same. You'll wonder why your sandwich bread doesn't have the same crunch; why there isn't that godly delicious dirty sauce slathered on the bread and deli meats; why your sandwich isn't stuffed with ridiculous goodness; and why the variety of choices are so limited. Ike's puts other sandwiches to shame.I ordered the Menage A Trois (for here) and a Nacho Boy (for the road) on the recommendation of the register guy. Total for the two is pretty pricey for sandwiches ($24) but WORTH EVERY PENNY. Menage A Trois - I wanted to die. It was SO GOOD, that it made me want to die. That dirty sauce.... the halal chicken... the dutch crunch.... I'm salivating as I'm writing and recalling this. Nacho Boy - Pretty good, but it wasn't the Menage A Trois. I also got to sample many of my friends' sandwiches:Jim Rome - ridiculously delicious.MILF - ridiculously delicious. and jalapeno poppers in a sandwich?? genius! Change - ridiculously delicious.Matt Cain - ridiculously delicious.Eli Manning - ridiculously delicious.The crazy thing about these sandwiches was that they were still ridiculously delicious and better than any other sandwich out there when eaten two days later. Yes, they are that good! So even if you are only going to be in SF for a few hours... hell, a few minutes! You MUST GO TO IKE'S.
Ya this place is cool but I'm not gonna wait in a line down to the end of the block for a sandwich. Not to mention how long it takes to get your sandwich after you order.Make sure you get your free bag of chips. Every sandwich comes with one but they don't tell you that.Been there twice and had the "Damon Bruce" and the "Spiffy Tiffy". Both were pretty good, cant really complain about them. I think this place got it's name by a bunch of hipsters claiming that this place is a staple in the city, a real "locals favorite".
Sandwiches galore with unique names is what you first encounter when walking into Ikes. I came in on a Friday afternoon and decided to try Matt Cain...the sandwich. It had all the right ingredients to make it one of my favorites there. Roast beef,Turkey, Salami, lettuce, tomato, and of course the dirty secret sauce all on top on Dutch crunch. I recommend using Dutch crunch as the bread, especially if you are planning to eat your sandwich later since it takes the longest to become soggy and still retains a good crunch.Food Highlight: Go for the Matt Cain: World Championship Edition!
Creative names and Sandwiches. Good for quick bite.
I try not to buy into the hype but face it Ike's is the bomb. The sandwiches are truly innovative and unique, they taste great, they are fresh and the bread is soooo good. Not only is the food good, the people there are really nice and really helpful....they love their work. It aint cheap but they have a great deal on certain days at certain times where you get a sandwich, a drink , and chips for the price of a sandwich. Plus you gotta love one of the dudes named nacho boy....super nice and Ike's mom hanging out there....that was pretty cool. Keep up the good work guys!
Epic. Some of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Love the Matt Cain.
best once-or-twice-a-year indulgence! the sandwiches are huge -- it's always a dilemma if i should save half for later or forge ahead and scarf the whole thing (usually end up eating it all and having regrets). lots of vegetarian and vegan options. the special sauce makes all of the sandwiches taste amazing now matter what is inside.
I love them. I have had good sandwiches, but I would have these everyday!
I'm excited to venture back to Ike's after a several year hiatus. Being from the East Coast, I was an early adapter to Ike's sandwiches, visiting this first store before there were long lines. After a few years from his opening, the lines and wait got crazy. I once tried to phone in an order to be told it was a 3 hour wait. I refused to wait and instead came to Yelp to voice my opinion. Ike wrote me, apologized, offered me a free sandwich and his cell phone number to get it from. To me, no matter if the prices have gone up (it sounds like they have gone up about $2-3 a sandwich since my last business), Ike is a great business person, sandwich maker and is committed to the Bay Area. I wish I could have extended my stay at SFSU to enjoy his sandwiches there..Thanks for being real, Ike--I'll be calling you soon!
Good sandwiches, but the wait time is ridiculous. Two people in front of me, and I had to wait 15 minutes for my sandwich. I just won't wait that long to eat a sandwich...Very pricey and too long of a wait. Won't be back.
Probably the best $50 sandwich I've ever had. That's $10 for the sandwich and $40 for the time spent standing in line listening to the hipsters go on about how they can't wait for that dirty sauce to ooze off the crunchy bread and into their mouths. While the sandwich was good, the sauce was a little too much at the end. $10 for a sandwich, while arguable high, can be justified in that you only the most portly of us would need something more for dinner.
My dream is to move to San Francisco and live down the street (or on top of) Ike's Place so that I can buy a sandwich everyday. And WHO CARES about obesity when you have Dirty Sauce and Mozzarella Sticks as add ons???Being Arab, I don't like sandwiches per se and I don't necessarily crave sandwiches but Ike's sandwiches are something else maybe because he's also Arab so he understands that if he's going to make an interesting sandwich, he'd better PACK it with deliciousness. Their sandwiches are to die for!!! I used to go to UC Berkeley and my sorority sisters and I would drive 45 minutes in the middle of bay area rush hour just to get our favorite sandwiches to boost our performance during finals week. I have introduced no less than 15 people to this place and they all LOVE it just as much as I do. My favorite is the MILF but I've also tried Tom Brady, Spiffy Tiffy, The Name of the Girl You're Dating, Hollywood's SF Cheesesteak, We're JUST Friends and a few other stolen bites from friend's sandwiches! The ONLY problem is the long lines because they are so popular!!!This is a MUST for all local and visiting SFers!! SO GOOO GET IKES!
Expect to wait in line, and expect to wait again to get your sandwich once you've ordered. It's always like that, so I don't think the wait can really be counted against the place, plus they move pretty quickly considering how many people they feed. The Menage a Trois sandwich is my personal favorite--haven't had much else from the menu since I usually only go when I'm craving it. Wish they had more locations.
Best sandwiches on earth. Seriously.I had the meatless meatball on dutch crunch...I have no words to express how meaty and heavenly it was. Perfect bread to "meat" to sauce ratio. Free apple caramel lollipops, service with a smile, every special instruction followed? Can I give this place 6 stars?What is sad is that I don't live in SF and I will literally be disappointed every time I eat a sandwich FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.
5 stars for the kryptonite. SO worth the wait! I don't remember what exactly was in the ginormous sandwich, but I can tell you it was a cornucopia of GOODNESS. I recall a variety of fried foods such as onion rings and jalapeno poppers, but honestly all of the flavors melded together and created a titillating sensation in my mouth. Although - I haven't figured out why with five employees behind the counter making sandwiches, it takes a twenty minute wait for ONE sandwich at 8:00PM (weeknight). Whatever though, it was amazing. AND AND AND they give out caramel apple lollipops with orders. I will DEFINITELY be back for more!
I love coming here for when there's no line......because it's usually 99% packed!Setting: Rainy dayTime: 11ishCommute: Hitching a ride or MUNITip: Ask for Dirty Sauce....tons of it if you can!Top 3 sandwiches so far:Hollywood's SF Cheesesteak w/ Extra Dirty SauceMatt Cain w/ Extra Dirty SauceCount of Monte Chase-O w/ Extra Dirty SauceYeah, you get the picture...EXTRA DIRTY SAUCE.Next on my list:Nacho Boy and Al Bundy!Love coming to this place...when there's no line. *I know they take phone orders and stuff....but I'm so spontaneous I never plan ahead*
i dont know what the hype about this place is, the wait is long and the sandwiches aren't that special. i guess perhaps, the names of the sandwiches are creative, but anyone can serve toasted roast beef and mayonnaise on dry bread and make you wait an hour..the last time i was here, we had to wait a good hour before we could even ORDER. that's lame. so my friends and decided to call ikes while we were there and ordered on the phone instead, which turned out to be a lot faster. i got the hot date, which was roast beef stuffed with jalapenos...it was not worth the wait. fyi, the parking in sf is really sucky, be aware of your meter, or you might end up with three tickets like my friend.
Sandwiches are good but i dont think it was worth the wait. Prices are high too.
I've never met a sandwiches equal.
When you want a hearty sandwich, Ike's is the place to go. I can't seem to go a weekend without stopping in to order my vegan ugly owl sandwich. And, yes, even vegans can get a good size sandwich.Ugly owl is by far my favorite. I add pickles because well I love them. I get it on sourdough but I ask for some of the bread to be scooped out so not too bready. I wouldn't have thought of asking for this except one of the first times I went, I asked how bready the sub rolls were and the friendly cashier made this suggestion. I would feel high maintenance asking for this, but they give me the impression that it's a frequent and easy request to fulfill. One issue I have had is about 20 percent of the time they are out of something. Off the top of my memory, it's been tomatoes, gluten-free bread, and vegan chicken. For the vegan chicken, I substitute with the vegan turkey, which is ok but I prefer the chicken version though I do appreciate having a runnerup as a vegan!Credit cards are accepted (yay!). They also give you free potato chips and a lollipop. Oh, beware of long lines, on weekends at least. I highly recommend calling ahead unless standing in line for at least 20 minutes is something you enjoy doing.
Rolled up to this joint the morning of New Year's Day. My friend Gunner (a sandwich afficionado if I ever knew one) had been raving about this place and was excited to check out their new location. Ike's had been booted from their old digs, and are now set up in Lime -- the brunch spot cum dance club that all the kids are talking about. I won't bother going into detail about the gyrating bodies and untz-untz-untz of Lime; we're here to talk sandos.There was a line snaking out the door as we arrived. Ike himself (a pint-sized and friendly fellow wearing a Ninja Turtles toque) handed out menus to peruse as we waited. Good thing too: this menu is fucking huge. Divided into meat, veggie and vegan, there are a tonne of creative entries on various kinds of bread (including Gluten free!). Some samples:M.I.L.F.: Halal Chicken, Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers(!), Franks Red Hot, Ranch.Lex Luthor: 1/3 Pound Burger, Chicken Fried Steak, Rib Eye Steak,Mozzarella SticksJeries' BIG Meat Sandwich: Turkey, Roast Beef, Pastrami, Ham, Salami (WTF)The sammiches run about $8-12 and come with a bag of chips. After a loooong wait for our sangwichos (36 min) we were rewarded. To be honest, I wasn't thinking straight and got a vegan meatball sub. But God damn, was it amazing. (Yes. It was.)Obligatory Title Pun: I wanna be like IKE.Menu Readability: Lithos? C'mon dudes. That typeface is a joke.Need to mention: Everything here comes with their 'dirty sauce.' Do I want to know?What this place teaches me about myself: My new year's resolution to try veganism only lasted seven hours.
Just had to update my review and say what a great place this is. As we were leaving, I witnessed a inspiring conversation outside in the freezing cold between a homeless man and an Ike's employee. The homeless man was just standing there -- not panhandling and not begging for food. The Ike's employee graciously asked if he was trying to get some food. The homeless man responded in the affirmative. Ike's employee told the homeless man, "I'll take care of you." He disappears for a few minutes and returns with a warm, delicious Ike's sandwich gratis. If you could only see the look on the homeless man's face and how thankful he was, you would be as inspired as you were full.Good for you Ike's. Kudos.
they have gluten free bread!!
A small hole in the wall, but the home to some of the bays most delicious sandwiches! Each meal comes with a free bag of chips and a lollipop, but its the sub that youre looking for. Id recommend you sit at the local Dolores Park because there is limited seating at the location itself
I first heard of Ike's Sandwich on the Food Network years ago. Since then, it has appeared on local Bay Area's new stations as their massive lines disrupted neighbors. Everything seems to be dandy now, but I honestly cannot say the same for their sandwich. The thing about overhyped sandwiches is that you build a somewhat unrealistic expectation and I compared it to some of the best sandwiches I ever had. Truthfully, I shouldn't had done that, but Ike's is suppose to be amazing!Eh, I went super early (10AM) so I avoided the huge crowds and ordered the Menage Trois. It was okay. Perhaps I ordered the wrong sandwich, but I was not blown away. $12 for a sandwich, a bag of chips, and lollipop is just disheartening for an average sandwich.
Oh man Oh man! my taste buds are jumping up and down at the thought of this place. 1st venture: Ike's moved to club Lime: OH M GEE was this an experience. I went a 1030 am to avoid any lines but there were already people lining up. Ordered the "menage a trois ", which I don't believe is on the extensive board menu, but I recommend everyone to try it at least once with dutch crunch bread. Took 15 minutes for my order, but it was well worth the wait. Simply heavenly, a symphony of flavors swirling to the tempo of orgasmic deliciousness!!! I don't even know what the ingredients are because they were so melded together ( a slight exaggeration..) . but nonetheless... it was AMAZING. oh and the funky chips were a definite cherry on top!2nd venture: FAIL...I set off on a quest to find this heavenly sandwich once again and went back to Ike's at Lime. Except...it was a club this time? There was strange house music with people drinking at 11am on a weekday? Strange sight.... The sandwich shop must have moved back to the original location...sorely disappointed and sad, I returned home with an empty stomach.
Ike's was one of the places on my to-do list when I went home for vacation. I just can't get over how damn delicious the MILF is. It's so good that D and I waited 2 hours to get our sandwiches and didn't even care.What puts Ike's over the top is that they also have great service. Despite being the busiest sandwich place in the city, they always manage to be friendly and seem to look out for their customers' best interests: as we were waiting in line outside and it started to rain, they took names down and allowed us to wait inside before ordering.The seating at Lime makes Ike's even more desirable. Before, I felt like such a jerk standing in front of a bunch of apartments that hated me solely for being an Ike's patron. Now, there's the added benefit of seating AND there aren't any angry neighbors. I can't wait to see what the new location will be like on my next trip home!
Best super sandwiches! They aren't normal sandwiches with normal prices or normal ingredients but they are ridiculously good.
Finally tried it and boy did I like it...I like it a lot! Being the ardent San Francisco Giants fan that I am, I had to order the Lincecum, and just like how Lincecum dominated the competition last year to run away with the Cy Young award by an unsuspecting and overwhelmingly large margin, Ike's Place seems to have done the same in it's own respect. I have to admit, it was definitely one of the better sandwiches I've had in my day so I know I will be back plenty more times to enjoy more of the signature sandwich concoctions especially since it is open late throughout the week so I can have America's favorite lunchtime food for dinner if I choose. Ike and his staff are also polite and friendly which makes it that much easier to go back. If you haven't checked out Ike's yet do yourself a favor, to avoid any crazy waits just call ahead for your sandwich and let them know when you'd like to pick it up.__________The Menage-a-Trois on dutch crunch is a seriously delicious sandwich!
If you can't find a sandwich you like here, you just don't like sandwiches....so don't bother.So here is how my first Ike's experience went......I asked my cousins to bring me to a popular eatary in SF, so they came up with Ike's. My reaction from the moment I was told about Ike's to my first bite of the sandwich was "IKE's? Why would anyone eat anything at a place called Ike? Is there a reason for me to fly 2500 miles to have a sandwich??"Let me tell ya.....waiting 45 minutes to just put in the order then 45 minutes to actually get the food didn't help. The sandwich was excellent. I had the "change" with wheat bread. I wanted to try all the breads. They all looked so good. I loved it so much that I wish there is an Ike's by my office. Ike, how about it? franchise?Anyway, is it worth the wait? NO! I can't say that nothing is worth that long of a wait, but a sandwich, no matter how good, isn't.I also ordered it without onion....but the idiots skipped the onions AND the onion rings (probably a major part of the "change").If you are concerned about someone having onion allergy, at least ask me what I want to skip. I was told about the lettus, tomatos and onion. I wanted to skip the raw onion. That was it.....unfortunately I missed out of beer battered onion rings.On my last day in the bay area, we stopped by Ike's in Redwood city on the way to SFO. It took us awhile to find it. There was no sign for it. We had to call up to confirm that it is indeed inside an office building.Once we walked in there, we were so happy that there was no line. A nice lady walked out and asked us if we are picking up an order. We said, no, but we'd like to order. She prompted inform us that the next order is at 2pm. This was 11am, and my flight was 1:20pm. She explained that it's a phone/internet order only location and there were 41 orders at the time (yes at 11am).3 words came through my mind......you can guess which 3.At least I got to smell it again........THAT was worth the trip.
The sandwiches are great. They are Halal meat and very tasty and incredibly large. I have recently became a vegan though to help fight animal cruelty. So I am not sure if there is anything on their menu that I can eat but if you don't mind meat the food tastes fantastic. There is no place to sit in this place. You have to eat in the park or in your car.
Ike's Place has charged to the front of my sandwich passion!Holy damn this was the best sandwich of my life, I have reason to move to San Fran. Ok, the obsurd wait is crazy, but I understand it having finally eaten here. Its good enough to warrant the number of people want ing to eat one of Ike's creations. My suggestion would be to call in your order and enjoy one of the other local spots in the meantime.My lucious indulgence was the Damon Bruce with sliced rib eye, A1 and onion rings on Dutch Crunch for an insane experince. Ya this thing is awesome, this is one of the first places where would never consider changing up the ingredients on a sando, Ike's has these puppies nailed! I could not help but vulture some of my friends Menage A Trois which was also a damn fine sandwich. My next stop will be the Lex Luther.If I could only figure out how to slow myself down while eating Ike's sando's and enjoy them more I would be thrilled.
Walk in the shoes (and taste buds) of a local and go to Ike's Place! When I visit SF, a sandwich isn't exactly the first thing I crave, but tried it out anyway due to the ridiculous amounts of positive Yelp reviews. Verdict: Ike's Place sandwiches live up to the hype; they are GOOD! The sandwiches have so much flavor you forget what a salad tastes like. I got to try the Menage a Trois and Matt Cain and I literally had to clean my palate with water to be able to appreciate the unique flavors of each. I ended up liking the Matt Cain better because it was not as heavy as the Menage a Trois. The location I went to did not provide a place to eat, so FYI it's more of a to-go spot. They give you a free bag of their Dirty brand potato chips of your choice as well as a caramel apple lollipop. My fatty sandwich cost me about $13ish. There's so much on the menu though.Ike's Place sandwiches are now up there with some of "the best I've ever had", Drake status.
Simply the best sandwich place - EVER. I'm from LA and every time I'm up in the Bay area, I make sure to visit ike's. The service is great, the sandwiches can feed you for two meals and I think it's pretty awesome that they include a bag of chips for free on the side. The dirty sauce, the amount of meat they give you and the options - my goodness the options!!! So many sandwiches to choose from and they are all so different. Full menu isn't on the chalkboard in-store, but it is online. For SURE figure out what you want before you get there or you'll be spending a lot of time reading the descriptions.
By far the best sandwich I had ever eaten ever! I got the Lincecumb and added fried zucchini. The bread was amazing and the sauces were just right. The staff there is so friendly and nice! Totally worth the wait! love the fact that they offer different types of chips you don't normally find anywhere else!
Before going to Ike's for the first time, I couldn't understand what all the hype was about. I mean, don't get me wrong, I like sandwiches as much as the next guy. Sandwiches are good. Some are really good. But how good can a sandwich actually be? They're just a combination of bread, vegetables, protein--maybe cheese, maybe meat, maybe both--perhaps a sauce.... So a sandwich is a sandwich, right?Wrong. The sandwiches at Ike's are beyond the beyond. I don't understand why they are so good. I mean if you look at the list of ingredients, the sandwiches certainly sound really good, some very unique, some very interesting, but they don't sound "wow, amazing!". Yet somehow, they are; they are even better than they sound. Somehow, they are so much better than the sum of their parts. I can't explain it. You've got to go taste for yourself.
One of the best sandwiches I have ever had!
Best freaking sandwich I've ever had! They have so many sandwiches to choose from, they even have a Sandwich Bible. They bake the bread themselves and it is so yum! I had the King Koopa, which has meatball marinara, jalapeno poppers, and mozzarella sticks. I actually didn't care too much for the mozzarella sticks because the jalapeno poppers overshadow them. So next time, I'll just stick to the Super Luigi (no mozzarella sticks).There was no wait when I went, which was after 9pm, but I've heard it gets busy so it would be best to go during a time when a lot of people may not be hungry.
Ah.. the vegetarian sandwich. It's something that is usually nothing to get excited about. My taste buds have been bored to death thanks to the abundance of tasteless vegetarian sandwiches I've had so I expected Ike's vegetarian and vegan sandwiches to only be a tad better. But my oh my!First of all, WOW the menu is so big it's a vegetarians dream!!!! You can close your eyes and pick a sandwich with your finger and you can guarantee it'll be AWESOME! The sandwiches are the furthest thing from boring you can get! All of the different ingredients blend perfectly and create a chunk of the most beautiful taste of goodness you'll ever have in your mouth. I especially LOVE having jalapenos in my sandwiches =). I've never been so happy to eat vegetarian food in my life. Ike's has changed my life forever!Yeeee!!! I LOVE YOU IKE!!!
Delicious sandwiches. Call ahead or use their app to skip the line. Eat in the park!
I had two friends suggest Ike's to us when we went up to visit SF. Ike's is a really small place to grab a sandwich to-go. It was a little confusing at first with all of the people standing around, waiting for their orders. The workers were all super nice. Whenever they called out our names, they would walk up our orders and hand them to us with a smile. There were SO many sandwiches to choose from, but with the help of yelp, we ordered the menage-a-trois and another sandwich with pastrami, both with dutch crunch bread. I also tried the one with pesto chicken, avocado, and mushrooms. One bite of the menage-a-trois, and I think I fell in love! An amazing balance of my favorite flavors, honey mustard, chicken, and mushrooms. A little too pricey for a sandwich, to be honest. But once in a while, it's okay to splurge on such an amazing beauty.UGH, I really wish we had an Ike's in SoCal! Want some right now.
Shockingly good.You need Ike's.Nothing less than a reformulation of the entire sandwich idea. Ike's Place is to sandwiches what Square is to transactions -- an evolutionary step that uses the same basic components afforded any shop/company in that space, and then gets busy making what came before look old and tired.Ike's sandwiches are so bursting with flavor(s) that you will be delighted from your very first bite all the way through to your free included caramel apple lollipop. Get some.Recommended? = Hell yes.
FLAGGING AS "NEIGHBORHOOD"THANKS, JASON G! . . . Angel S, John G, Cedric F, my uber reliable wei sik Yelper bros!  -These guys don't readily toss 5***** at NE ole eatery.$105.50? ::  How many guys in your office, Jace? albeit, hungry men hunters, notwithstanding!. . . Do they deliver? LOL/ C U THERE!
I'm a more traditional Italian sandwich kinda guy (Lucca's, Molinari's, etc.) but everyone in our group loved their creative sandwich. Unique flavors, generous portions, delicious combination of ingredients. Upbeat atmosphere. Friendly staff. I'll be back.
So much hype around this place, I was excited to finally try it. But it took me a good 15 minutes and walking in circles a few times to find this place since they relocated! But onto the sandwiches...My boyfriend and I went for a quick lunch and decided to share a sandwich since they were a pretty good size. We got the Change, which basically rib eye, beer battered onion rings, cheese, bbq sauce, the traditional dirty sauce lettuce and tomato, and whatever the hell else is on there and we got it on the Dutch Crunch.OH. MY. GAWD. So much delicious goodness, we both scarfed it down. It also comes with a bag of Dirty Chips, I recommend the Funky Fusion. Mmm. And they also throw in some lollipops, we got Caramel Apple!The sandwich itself was around $12, pretty pricey, but it's a big sized and each half filled both of us up. Definitely worth it.We actually went back the next day and this time got our own sandwiches. I got the Menage a Trois (chicken, honey, honey mustard, bbq sauce, lettuce, tomato, dirty sauce) and my boyfriend got the Hollywood SF Cheesesteak (rib eye, mushrooms, cheese, dirty sauce, etc). They ran out of the Dutch Crunch but the French and Sourdough are both good. My boyfriend actually got the Change sandwich to take home on his flight back to LA.Eat here.
Holy crap! My mouth was in heaven when I bit into my sandwich from Ike's Place! I can still taste it! Ok, let's start from beginning. I arrived at about 11:20 AM and was expecting a long line and no parking! I was pleasantly surprised with a parking spot right in front and no line at all! Woo hoo! Must have been luck! :) The guy helping me was awesome! He was patient with me and gave me great suggestions! Couldn't have been happier with the two sandwiches I devoured with boyfriend! I ordered the Menage a trois and the Damon Bruce. OMG, I can't wait to go back!! I really do want to try every single one. :D The sandwiches are kinda pricy but most definitely worth it! Filet mignon of sandwiches right here!
Don't let the board-runneth-over menu + the 'special' sandwiches signage surrounding it overwhelm you. You are bound to discover something you probably didn't even know you liked, like pineapple and chicken marinara. All I did was ask the busy cashier what she highly recommended and she enthusiastically suggested a few things I was already debating. The 2008 winner The Backstabber grabbed me, and I traded my other half for my friend's Paradise Found. You can actually save the other half for your next meal, if you can find the discipline in you. And Ike's goes beyond the fries for your side option. onion rings, mozzarella sticks, or jalapeno poppers are your side choices too. or a bag of chips. For your sweet finisher, they throw in a lovely candied-apple lollipop.It's an easy walk from Dolores Park or Castro shopping. As long as it's not raining your good to go. it's outside seating only. Or you can take your goodness to go, to devour in the comfort of your own what-have-you.
The sandwiches are downright phenomenal. Probably the best I have ever had, easily. My only qualm is the price. 10-12 bucks for a sandwich is a bit much for me. Get the Menage a Trois. It has soooo much flavor. I can't even describe how good it is. The free chips are tasty too.Parking kind of sucks, but that is SF for you.
How could I not give Ike's Place anything short of 5 stars? I admit my business is brought to you by Man vs. Food but hot damn! They make some honest to God delish sandwiches. The place is clean, very laid back, the customer service is great. The wait takes a bit, but I mean do you want your sammy good or fast? Love Ike's place and recommend it to anyone!PS you get a complimentary bag of gourmet chips and a sucker...sucka! It really doesn't get much better.
I liked the sandwich for what it was but I don't understand what all the hype is about. It's a good sandwich but definitely not in my top 5 in SF.
Um, how is it that I haven't reviewed Ike's yet??? If you're looking to satisfy your sandwich craving, come here!! They've got an intimidating list of sandwiches, offering a lot of vegetarian and vegan options too.I recommend going to their website, pick out what you want from their endless options, call in the order, and then pick it up in an hour. Yes, that's how long the usual wait is. EVERY time I come here, there is a massive line or crowd. But in my opinion, it's usually worth it. These are not sandwiches you can get elsewhere.I usually order the meatless mike. A lot of my friends do too even though they are hugh carnivores. I swear, you don't even realize it's not meat, it's that good. The dutch crunch bread has the best texture, the sauce tasty, the filling just right.I've ordered other sandies too but I just can't remember the name. They were yummy also but my fav is still the meatless mike.Def recommend checking their sandwiches out!
Yeah.. I don't see the appeal.The sandwich was fine, nothing mind-blowing but certainly a good, warm, sandwich. But was it worth standing in line for 90 minutes while watching drunk people dance on a Saturday afternoon? Sorry, but no.Even the people who called ahead were stuck waiting on the sidewalk for at least 20 minutes, though that seems like a much more reasonable wait time for an overpriced sandwich. The line was disorganized, there was only one cashier, and they couldn't even bother to laminate their menu. Oh and ps, there's no place to sit and eat your overpriced, overrated sandwich that you just waited an hour for.I guess if you're trying to work your way through the entire 7x7 list then you'll have to brave these ridiculous lines eventually, but I hope you aren't as underwhelmed as I was.
get it on dutch crunch bread, and prepare for food coma! try to come at off hours if you dont want to wait in line. great sandwich place!
Loved the wasabi chicken sandwich. Chips are a nice touch too. Perfect spot to get some picnic items before heading to Dolores Park.
Dear Ike,   Thank you so much for the EX BOYFRIEND! The only EX BF that I only think about and will be coming back for more. If not the ex boyfriend, that FAT BASTARD is just as good but nothing tops off LINCECUM. It must be there DIRTY SAUCE that keeps me coming back for more! Can't wait to come back to your place. I'll be coming back for that BACKSTABBER too!                                                                                 Yours Truly, JulieP.S WE'RE JUST FRIENDS sounds good.On the other note. If you don't know what I'm talking about, You must be an Ike's virgin. You better get to Ike's place ASAP because you are missing out! Friendly atmosphere/service. I'm craving for some Ike's as I write this review! So with that said, there sandwiches are AMAZING!
I deffff like Ike's Place.Sandwiches? Meh most of the time... but here at Ike's they take sandwiches to a whole new level! They have like thousands of different kinds, okay not thousands, but enough to make your head spin and get confused from all the different choices.I can't even remember the names of the sandwiches I got but they were freaking delicious! Please give sandwiches another chance, Ike's will change them for you!
Dear [NAME OF THE GIRL I'M DATING],I want you to know IT'S NOT YOU, IT'S ME, but I think it's time for a CHANGE. Everything was SPIFFY TIFFY until the day I was GOING HOME FOR THANKSGIVING, I met someone and as I tasted LIZZY'S LIPS at the TWIN DOLPHIN CAFE I have to say she is one HOT MOMMA HUDDA. She's up there with MARILYN MONROE, I'm talking about a REAL SEXY GIRL. She would make one fine M.I.L.F. someday and she really gets me like a pass from MONTANA TO RICE. Now I know, I've been no SUPERMAN, sitting on the couch all day like AL BUNDY, acting like KING KOOPA playing you for a game of SUPER MARIO. So call me a BACKSTABBER all you want, a WOMANIZER, a "HELLA" FAT BASTARD if you will, you might even say I have a NAPOLEON COMPLEX, I don't care, because from now on "WE'RE JUST FRIENDS." So here's THE CATCH, it's not like it's DOOMSDAY, think of it more like PARADISE FOUND, a chance for us to experience THE LAST KISS, and I can make it worth your while if you were down for a MANAGE-A-TROIS in this BIZZARE-LOVE-TRIANGLE we got going on. Think about it, this can be bigger than the SF GIANTS. So if you want to holler at me and "SAY HEY," then meet me at Ike's Place and bring that extra Dirty Sauce, but only if you're game. Sorry to be such a JOKER,Your EX-BOYFRIEND,LEX LUTHORp.s. Please don't go all TONY SOPRANO and whack me.
Been here with my wife a few times. And on nights we find ourselves contemplating a drive to the city, just for this spot! Yea yea, I know they have other locations.. But this one in the Castro is Top Notch and by far our Favorite.. She gets the Matt Cain, I get everything! Feeling brave? Try the Kryptonite.. It'll set you back a Drew Jackson, but Igotta say.. It's well worth every cent! Hurry up and come to SJSU..
As a Muslim I appreciate the Halal meats
This was my second visit to Ike's Place... and from memory.. my first visit... this place was amazing. We had made a trip to the city.. had a late breakfast.. ate brunch... had lunch.. and then came by Ike's... already full.. but ordered a sandwich anyway... ate it.. and thought it was sooo good.. we considered going back for another.... Too bad I don't remember which sandwich we got!This trip.. well.. we had the ScoutMob free sandwich.. which was a bit too creamy for my taste.. but still pretty good.... But I also ordered two other sandwiches... The Doomsday & The Change... Keep in mind that this was ordered and taken down to SJ before I had a chance to eat it....The Doomsday.. was.. WOW.. soooo much meat and stuff.. it wasn't bad.. but definitely an overload on meats and stuff... I was definitely full after eating 1/4 of this... (I also sampled some of the other two we had)The Change was pretty good too... I tried this after I ate the doomsday.. but it had nice flavor! I think the sandwiches are pretty pricey... not something I would get on a weekly or even a monthly basis.. but now that I know they have a location in Stanford (found out from their website).... I most likely will go and get a sandwich sometime.
I always order the Matt Cain. I'm addicted. So many sandwiches to choose from, always free chips and a lollipop.
I'm not sure how i feel about the new ike's location at lime. We went the day after new years and had fellow yelper Audrey T. phoned in our order prior to arriving. Once we got there, they were missing one of our order so we had to wait another 15 minutes for them to make a new sandwich. On the other hand, the cashier did give us a discount so i guess we can't be TOO mad. The sandwiches are just as good as the original Ike's location although I have to say, whoever pieced together the sandwich felt the need to put all the meat on one side of the sandwich :( And on top of that once we got home, Audrey found out they messed up her order as well and gave us two of the same sandwich. Props tho to the cashier for being able to work in the noisy and crowded environment when he was clearly hung over.
Amazing verity love love love this place!
I took advantage of the free scoutmob sandwich deal and ordered us two elvis keith sandwiches. It comes half the size of a regular sandwich but hey it's enough to get me full and I'm not complaining about a free sandwich. Despite the wasabi mayo, the sandwich was really good. The halal chicken is really something. The sour dough bread is really good bread. I can't wait to be back to try some other sandwiches. P.S. Order over the phone for pick up so you don't have to wait in the long line for your free sandwich!
I enjoyed my sandwich from Ike's. I did not like the ordering and waiting system here. Must be a better way. I wold recommend Ike's to friends.
For the simple low-down, the sandwiches are good...really good. I split the menage-a-tois and the heath ledger with a buddy. We devoured them without speaking. The chicken was a little dry, but overall delicious.So why the 3 stars?If the sandwiches were decently priced (say...8 bucks with tax), I would be here once a week.  But I payed 13 bucks for the heath ledger. Seriously? It just seems rude to charge that much for a sandwich, and for that reason I won't be back. Not that they need my business anyways due to their insane popularity.Oh I called my order in and it only took 30min at lunchtime. Yelp should change the $ to $$
I don't know what it is about a local favorite becoming "the place to go because I saw it on the Food Network" that makes me cringe a little. But this is what I feel this has become. Granted... I did only come here based on a recommendation from someone in New Jersey telling me they saw this place but that's neither here nor there =).The sandwiches were definitely legit. And maybe if I didn't have my amazing go to sandwich place in the city that I've been going to since I was in high school, I would say that this place was it. BUT I am unfortunately biased to my favorite sandwich place. With that being said, Ike's place definitely is a close second. The sandwich was filled to the brim with sandwich goodness. I had the Matt Cain and whatever the Godfather sauce was in it was awesome. My husband had the "friends with benefits" and he said it was pretty juicy. He was definitely a fan of the sauce, but he was annoyed that the sandwich didn't hold very well (everything kind of slid out from the other side). The one thing that caused this review to drop one star was the wait. Now I love me some awesome sandwich, but we waited over 15 minutes for our sandwiches (just two of them). If it was a faster operation, I would have given this place 4 stars. Also I would love to have some size variety of sandwiches, but I don't know if/when that will happen. Overall, solid sandwich.
what can I say, this place is the best sandwich shop around. Delicious rolls, high quality meats and cheeses, a fun selection of drinks and all served by friendly and competent folks. GO NOW!
Yum yum!Finally got to try Ike's! We went on a Tuesday so there was almost no line, and we actually managed to get seats inside.. O_OI had the Nacho Boy. Nacho, as in not your, as in cheese that isn't yours. It's roast beef, avocado, mushrooms, and swiss cheese. YUM!I have a feeling that every sandwich here is a 5 star sandwich. So, I plan on coming back and trying out ten or fifteen additional sandwiches.
Great food!! Hubby and I went to San Francisco just to eat here!! We saw it on Man vs Food..of course we were the only people there in Dodger gear surrounded by Giants fans..but Ike made us feel very welcome!! Food was AMAZING!! great people and great food!! What more could you ask for! Thanks Ike!!!
I never realized Ike's place was a mere 1.1 miles from my house, so I ordered ahead. I decided for my first sandwich I would get something sounding good but not too wild, so I ended up with an "Eli Manning" which is Chicken Breast, Zesty Garlic and Herb Sauce, Mushrooms, Avocado, Cheddar. (Note when they say Chicken breast they mean chicken salad style, not a whole grilled chicken breast).Positives:- Girl behind the counter was super cute- 1.1 miles from my house- No wait when I went- Sandwich was simply delicious. The bread was so fresh and light in a "didn't fill me up on bread" way. The chicken was fresh and tasty, and the ingredients tasted top notch. It's a pretty big sandwich but I managed to put it all away for dinner, I could easily eat half with a side of some sort and have a 2nd delicious half later :)Cons:- None
My sister, mom and I stopped by this place for a late lunch after going to service at Reality SF (literally like a block away) because we were hungry and didn't want to drive far for some good food. I Yelped this place and after seeing the good reviews we decided to head on over.Let me start off with the negatives...The line was looong! It took us about 15-20 minutes to get our orders in and another 10-15 minutes to receive our sandwiches... SANDWICHES! I would understand if we were at a sit-in restaurant but these were sandwiches. We were also a bit disappointed at the prices. It came out to about $36 (including a bottled water for me and a soda for my sister) for the three of us for lunch. A bit pricey compared to what we expected when we saw the single $ on Yelp. That being said, the sandwiches were absolutely delicious! I got the Elvis Kieth which has their halal chicken (yummy!) smothered in teriyaki, wasabi mayo (could hardly taste), and swiss cheese. I also added banana peppers, pickles, and red onions which finished it off well! The only downside about their sandwiches (other than the price) are that you have to eat them right away or else they'll get soggy. I ate mine about 20 minutes after getting them and it was starting to leak through the paper wrapping. But otherwise, the sandwiches were great!
I went to visit SF in May 2012. I looked up on Yelp where to eat for lunch. I saw that this place got crazy good reviews so I decided to give it a try. There was a line that extended outside of the restaurant and the wait was WORTH IT. I got I think #11 or #12, with chicken in it. I took the sandwich to go and ate it at nearby Twin Peaks (it was a gorgeous day!). OH MY GOODNESS-- the food was AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The sauce is so unique and out of this world. The bread was perfect. The chicken was moist. I am so upset that there's no Ike's Place here in Atlanta where I live. I am so willing to go all the way back to SF just for Ike's Place. This place is a gem and you must go there- that is an order! =) They have halal sandwiches, too! By the way, the place is very small with no room for tables because of line! There are some chairs lining the restaurant or you can eat outside on the sidewalk =) OR YOU CAN EAT AT TWIN PEAKS right nearby like I did so you can enjoy great food and great view of SF in one! =)
I've been meaning to try this place and even though it's about an hour away from me, it's worth the drive/wait now that I've had their sandwiches. SO good (well duh, 3,560 people can't be wrong)!The people at the register as super accommodating/will help you with their daunting menu the first time you're there (thank goodness). Apparently that's the simplified version of their menu, each sandwich branches off into more suggestions of other sandwiches with different things! You also get a bag of Dirty Chips and a caramel apple lollipop with your sandwich :).I got the Ex-Girlfriend (I was gonna get The-Name-Of-The-Girl-I'm-Dating but the guy asked if I liked bacon--which led to me going with the Ex-Gf!), and my friend got the MILF (which branched off of something else, can't remember). Both were friggin' delicious.Whatever you get, get it on the Dutch Crunch! That bread is the buuueeesst.
An over-rated sandwich. Menu has an appearance of all these choices, but really it's a rearrangement of the same ingredients. They don't offer enough veggie fixings in their sandwiches. Always too saucy and messy. Way over-priced. Go to Rhea's Deli(19th&Valencia) or even Mr. Pickles(20th&S.Van Ness) instead.
3 n half really good sandwiches ,but i hate the close to 30 min wait on it
Best sandwich I have ever had!!! It cant get any better than this!!! The staff is funny and enetrtaining as well as the names of the sandwiches !!! Absolutley love IKE'S!!!
Obligatory 5 star rating for Ike's. /end review.
Dearest Ike --Joan here.I must say my limo driver drove past this sandwich hovel in hopes of me curing my hunger pains and I saw a line of angry, ancy dirty people all waiting to get a sandwich. I sat in the limo for awhile watching the pathetic wait in the endless line for what seemed an eternity.I stepped from my cab and headed to the head of the line, head titled back, scarf draped ever so lovely and I trotted over to the front of the line in my come f@$k me heels and expected to be greeted like the star that I am. No such luck for this once top-billing star.I was pushed away and told I would have to wait 3 hours for a sandwich. 3 hours! My word! I peaked in and saw the sloppy sandwiches piled on top of the plates oozing grease and grime. It reminded me of my Academy Award winning role as Mildred Pierce when I smelled of grease and grime and I was nothing more than a common frump.I hightailed it back to my limo and headed straight for what really is a guilty pleasure - A whopper with cheese all for $1.99 and I didn't even have to leave the comfort of my limo to get it.Wake up my dears - no place is worth waiting several hours for a sandwich. Not even Joan would do that!Bless You!Joan Crawford
It's no fine dining, and the tendency of people who don't know the neighborhood to huddle inside and eat in the waiting area is a bit obnoxious (seriously, people, there's a park a couple blocks away!), but I love the plethera of vegan options!
I normally would be giving this place a 5 star review... it was pretty amazing... ahhhmazing BUT they got our order wrong, hence the 3 star review.We called in at about 2:30pm for an order to pick up at 5:30pm on Sunday evening. We decided to go all out since I was an Ike's virgin, so we ordered the Kryptonite... When we got home to eat it we opened it up to find it didn't have ANY mozzarella sticks, stuffed jalapeno poppers, OR beer battered onion rings... WTF!?!? All in all the sandwich was still really good. Just a bit annoying since it wasn't exactly what we ordered and we were too far to go back and get our proper order. I will definitely be trying Ike's again... hopefully next time they'll get our order right and I can change my review to 5 stars.
I am still full from my sandwich and I ate it four hours ago. My thoughts were already fond of this place when we showed up and the staff were all singing along to Foreigner, then I got to take a look at the menu. The vegetarian/vegan options are great, they have all kinds of vegetarian meats to choose from as well as various toppings. I had some good conversation with one of the employees about Sesame Street, and my sandwich was the best I have had in a while. Ike's Place rules.
Eff you Ike's Place.I was so excited to try this place after seeing it featured on Man V. Food and boyyyy was I disappointed!How dare you smother my sandwich in your dirty mayo-based sauce when your menu claimed otherwise?! And after I waited almost an hour - yes, an HOUR - in line. I can only hope the homeless man who picked it out of the trash enjoyed your $12 sandwich.
get the "JIM ROME" (turkey, ikes red pesto, avocado, cheddar) or with bacon it's called "BLOCKED!!" matt cain and menage a trois can't hold a candle to ikes red pesto. seriously, try it. you can thank me lateri highly recommend ordering in advance via fb or iphone app so you don't have to wait in line for 30 minutes
Garry and wasabi great food and fast service. Good looking plate
if you haven't read enough reviews about the incredible experiences at ikes, this is one more.GO. TRY EVERYTHING. SMILE AFTERWARDS.
The sandwiches here are truly yummy. Much better than the Redwood Shores and Stanford location, even. Possibly the best I have ever had. But, really? Offering on Facebook and Yelp Talk a free sandwich to the best FIVE STAR reviewers with no purchase necessary to enter? No purchase necessary? So I don't even have had to try your food to write a review of it and win? But, my review has to be five stars? Just please help you make "Hot on Yelp" so you can go back to making $$$$ a day like you did before the move instead of $$$ a day. Is that what this is about? Ike, you are making me sympathetic to the landlord that evicted you and is now being vilified by your fans (I used to be one). I've heard that there are two sides to every story....
Went here because of high yelp ratings and Man VS Food. Aside from not having a spot to sit and eat this place is amazing! I had the doomsday sub which contains every possible meat. Food was perfect! We only waited 15 minutes at 10:30AM but by the time we left with our food the line was out the door. Great experience! Will absolutely come back next time I'm in the area.
if i had a genie and she/he gave me 3 wishes one would be to open up an ike's in OC, preferably la habra, and give me a front of the line pass for LIFE!this was definitely on my to do list...probably my #1 thing to do in san francisco lol. man v. food hyped it up for me and so did all my friends and man they didn't even do justice. i got the manage a trois on dutch crunch and added jalapenos. it was sooooo amazing...omg the first bite was a tastegasm in my mouth! that's a bit awkward since the sandwich was a menage a trois lol. my friend had the super mario and loved it. i had a bite and it was amazing. all sandwiches come with a bag of dirty chips and we wanted the air fries...but they didn't have it :(come to find out they're in the process of moving and are having some issues so they're renting out lime during the day. i can't wait to come back and check out their new spot...ahhhh i'm so hungry now :( damn you ike's! why can't you be in la habra, ca :(
Great sandwiches; wish they had more veggie options.
How do you make a sandwich taste this good? SUPERMAN FTW! on dutch crunch, extra dirty, extra lettuce, extra tomatoes. GOOD LUCK eating that sucker, might need some forks and knives. I'd say the superman is enough to feed about 4 people or 2 starving people.If only there was something remotely comparable in socal :[
Ike's Place is at Lime which is an equally great food establishment. I was able to try many different sandwiches here my favorite was the Menage A Trois halal chicken, real honey, honey mustard, bbq, pepper jack, swiss, cheddar. The bread is perfectly toasted. All the sandwiches I have tried there were some of the best sandwiches I have ever had. The flavors of the sandwich are a perfect cohesion of flavors. We did stand in line for 30-45mins but it was worth it. Parking was also a mess but that's all of the Castro Area
I had a (name of girl I'm dating) and it was deeeelicious!!! I loveee their dirty sauce. It really tops it all off in taste. I was expecting a light sandwich, but that was definitely not what I got. I actually felt heavy after having my sandwich, but it was so good!! Their lettuce is very fresh and chicken was not dry. I loved my french bread; it was so soft and it soaked up all the sauce. It is interesting that they have the cash register in front of the door as you wait in line outside. I wish they had more tables/chairs outside for customers.
Was there for conference this Month , found it by chance. What a lucky break, has to one of the best .Please go, your taste buds will thank you.
I am a fan of Ikes, but not a fan of Ikes at Lime. Delicious sandwichs do not mix well with pounding music and people dancing in the front window on a saturday afternoon. LameFor awhile now you could get in and out in about 30 min with your tasty sandwich. For some reason lately, they can't even pick up the phone! Obviously the jig is up and now its back to the original surge and wait time. Lame. Elvis Keith. Bomb.
Okay, I admit. I wouldn't have tried this place if Adam from Man vs Food didn't feature it on his show and with my short trip to San Francisco it was the perfect time to check this place out. So, from Los Angeles to San Francisco I went.We arrived at the sandwich shop to see only a few people in line outside. Mind you, there are only a couple chairs to sit and eat on outside, none inside. The standing in line, ordering, and the wait for our (mine & my boyfriend's) sandwiches was roughly 30 minutes (obviously, this isn't a Subway). Ike was working and the entire staff were men and you could only go inside to get a drink. Me and my boyfriend ordered 2 sandwiches, both combos (with chips and drinks) and our total came out to almost $20. Trust me, it's well worth the money. As we were waiting outside the line seemed to grow even longer, so it was good timing for us. They called our name and we took our sandwiches to eat in my car.My sandwich was called "Hot Date For Hire" and it was probably the best sandwich ordering decision of my life. In it was the perfect amount of sliced rib-eye, stuffed jalapeno poppers, lettuce, tomatoes, and the most important ingredient of all, "Dirty Sauce" all wrapped around a wonderful french roll (you can choose your bread). The sandwich was juicy but not messy and a good size (although, I only finished half just so I'd have something to eat on the way home that wasn't from Jack in the Box). The combination of rib-eye & jalapeno poppers sounds funny, but everything about it was awesome. They don't offer cold sandwiches but then, who eats cold sandwiches anymore? The next time I take a trip to San Francisco, Ike's Place is definitely on the top of my list of places to grab a bite.Oh and they also gave us cotton-candy flavored lollipops for dessert. Cute, huh?
Love Ike's Place even though I've only been there a couple times. I love all the different combinations they've put together, if I could I would try them all! I've had the Jim Rome the first time I went there and I thought it was delicious. The best is going up to Dolores Park on a nice sunny day and having your sandwich there. The fact that I get a bag of chips and my favorite caramel apple lollipop is pretty awesome too.
Excellent sandwiches and top notch customer service! Very busy place, but staff is very quick and helpful. Hubby and I ordered a couple of different sandwiches recommended by cashier. He was very helpful and had a recommendation in practically every category. Love that!! Along with their yummy sandwiches they throw in a bag of free chips - delish. Very unique chip flavors - loved all we got.  We took the sandwiches to go and enjoyed them thoroughly. Will plan on returning here before our vacation is over. Way to go, Ike!!
Great Sandwich , long lines , will come back when have plenty of time to stay in line ...
I realized I can track how many times I actually order Ike's in a month by how many caramel apple suckers I have collected... It is a lot. I am a veggie and there aren't many places that veggies have this many options! My top 3? Love Triangle, Wario, and the Jessica Rabbit. YUM. Keep 'em coming
Ike's has always been somewhat of a Holy Grail for me, because I can't ever fucking find it. When I took some time off during the day from work, I decided that since I was already in the city for an appointment I would head over to Ike's and get a sandwich--lo and behold, however, I can't seem to navigate myself out of a brown paper bag. I had been walking up hell and back in heel and a tight skirt that provided limited range for my stride, and sweating because let's face it, my cardio rate blows. So that day, I said Ike's can go to hell, while I quietly cried myself to sleep that night. Fortunately the next time I was in the city, I called up Adam and said, "Let's go to lunch!" It's great knowing someone with no job because they have nothing better to do than hang out with you. At least that's what I like to tell myself. Also, he knew where it was and I had an iPhone to navigate. We ordered--I got the Backstabber with chicken breast, artichoke hearts and probably rainbows and leprechaun farts because it was DELICIOUS. Adam had the Sarah Palin--I swear that boy has an unhealthy obsession with that woman. I say unhealthy also in regards to the fact that this sandwich had mozzerella sticks in it...and while that is also magical, it's kind of weird. Sitting outside on an unusually warm Autumn afternoon, donning our sunglasses and basically being totally badass, we start to have a conversation about getting away with murder. We discussed killing someone we had no connection to that didn't deserve it, versus killing someone we knew but not so well that we could be a suspect. "Well why don't I just kill you?", Adam finally said. "Dude, you can't kill me. I'm supposed to be helping you dispose the body." Then the rest of the conversation was me trying to convince him that keeping me around was beneficial to him. Moral of the story: stay away from Adam when he's around sharp objects.
You definitely can't say these Food Network and Travel Channel shows aren't effective. I can't seem to go anywhere without having to wait in excess of an hour for food anymore. But then again, it's because of them that I'm able to "find" these places that I otherwise would not have. So I, along with these restaurant owners I'm sure, thank you.The wait here on Saturday was an hour long, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching people drive by and stare with their mouths unattractively wide open, clearly in disbelief at the length of the line. I'd do the same thing if I was just driving by.Anyhow, since they were out of steak (I so wanted the Shawn Michaels), I settled for the Eli Manning (even though I can't stand that guy). Now, I'm not a fan of shredded chicken, so I didn't particularly enjoy that aspect of my sandwich. But all of the other ingredients (dirty sauce, mushroom, avocado, cheddar and the mozzarella sticks I requested) went extremely well together, especially with the Dutch Crunch bread (I highly recommend getting your sandwich on this bread. It's sort of like an Italian bread that has a nice crunch on the outside). It was the right size and had the right amount of everything in it.Note: At 12:30pm, we tried to call in our order per someone's suggestion, but we were told by an employee it would probably be faster to just come in and place the order there since they give priority to the customers that are there and that if we placed a phone order, our sandwiches wouldn't be ready until 2pm. So we got there at 1pm, waited in line and finally placed our order at 2pm and got our sandwich at 2:30pm. Yeaaaah, I don't know what to tell you; seems like you're doomed to wait either way.
Okay I saw Ike's on Man v Food. When I saw all those sandwiches I wanted to try one. So for my birthday I went to SF and had this place on my to-do. After looking though their many choices of sandwiches picked out the best one I think...the M.I.L.F. sandwich.the funniest part was ordering it. I was laughing by the name of the sandwich. But when it came and I had my first bite...it was amazing! I loved it. The dirty sauce was amazing! plus the spicy chicken in the MILF sandwich was SOOOO good! Its worth the trip from LA to SF!
There are a few downsides to this place but not that many, trust me. I love that it's a cute little sandwich store, but the lines are ridiculous and there aren't that many places to sit and enjoy the fiesty little thing! THE SANDWICHES ARE AMAZING. THE INGREDIENTS, THE NAMES, EVERYTHING YOU COULD THINK OF TO MAKE A SANDWICH - THIS PLACE WILL BLOW YOU AWAY. Not blown away yet? Haha, Roast beef, corned beef, pastrami, salami, turkey, bacon, ham, mozarella sticks, stuffed jalapeno poppers, beer battered onion, avo, pesto, extra pepperjack... all in one. Hello Kryptonite! I think by far, my favorite sandwich so far that I've tried is the Tony Soprano. Very simple, but italian dressing? Who knew!
In the top five sandwiches I've ever had. Yeah. (I've had a lot of sandwiches)Seriously though this place is a little gem hidden further out from the hustle and bustle of downtown / touristy SF. We stopped by on our way out of town after the Golden Gate Bridge and I got this Owl something sandwich, vegan, of course, that blew my mind. Haha wow I sound like such a foodie now...Really though, this place is getting that elusive fifth star because it really is one of the best places I've been to to grab some grub. Their menu is amazing (even if it weren't you can always create your own) and they have the most delicious vegan/vegetarian options for sandwiches I've ever seen. If any of the others are half as good as my Owl whatever, I will definitely be coming back to try them.Part of that fifth star though is a little personal because since they had no where to sit and eat inside, we were forced to eat sitting on the back of my truck parked on the quiet side street a few shops down. Ah. There's really nothing like eating great sammies with best friends in the warm California sunlight, and taking in the moment. Plus, I just love any excuse to sit in the back of my truck. Double win.
Amazing.... I never thought finger foods would actually taste so good in a sandwich!
So many options! Where to begin? Go w/ the dutch crunch bread and add the red pesto sauce, too.Really friendly and helpful staff.Parking is not an issue on a week day.
My Ratings:Quantity: 5 - Great portionsQuality: 5 - ExcellentPrice: 4 - GoodLocation: 3 - SmallParking: 3 - Street ParkingService: 4 - GoodSpeed: 4 - GoodOverall: Good service, Tiny place, BUT Amazing Sandwiches! Highly recommended!My Opinion/Story:Coming from a non-sandwich person, I truly love Ike's sandwiches. I love that they serve their sandwiches hot/warm, they have a special sauce that's not just mayo and mustard, and they load it with meat, veggies and anything you want. We went on a Sunday afternoon and lucky enough to find a parking across the street. We ordered our sandwiches and waiting about 10-15 mins. We got our drinks and chips and almost finished it when our sandwiches came out. It was about a footlong but it was nice and toasty. I got their SF Giants which is Turkey, Bacon, Swiss, & Mushroom less the bacon on a French bread with lettuce and tomatoes. It was so good that I really fell in love at first bite. I'd wait forever for another one of their sandwiches.Place is small and only has two tables, parking can be hard to find, service is good and depending on how far back you are in line, the speed of getting your food can be a wait. Otherwise, really good sandwich.
Im not a big fan of sandwiches. But after Ike's Im in love. Got THE GATOR + grilled mushrooms. Simply amazing. Their extra dirty sauce is just delicious. Very very flavorful and it makes you keep eating and eating till youre done with the sandwich. Definitely a place to come back!
Wooohhooo, when I say I am not really into sandwiches I mean it, but this place may have changed my mind forever, too bad there isn't an Ike's in Miami. I decided to get The Tony Soprano, Turkey, Turkey Ham, Cheese and their sauce that was lets just say "fall into a coma and never come back". Oh soo good, Delish!My boyfriend got a sandwich that had Pastrami with a cabbage and I don't know what else but it was also really really good. A bag a chips comes with the sandwich. They do take a while to get your sandwich out as there is constant people coming in with the line outside the door, but it's worth the wait because this is absolutely one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. xo,kristin nicolesoapnights.com
I love my Menage a Trois. Yes, pun intended. I ordered that on my second visit, and have continued to do so every time I order from Ike's.
Awesome sammiches!Full of flavor and very creative in the ingredients.
Not that this place needs another review, but I just came back and felt I had to Yelp it. I never heard of the place until recently and then saw all the great reviews and let me tell you that they are warranted. The sandwich I had was called Paradise Found with ham, marinara, pineapple, and provolone. Along with all the other fixins! It was really excellent. And the price was right.It only gets docked one star for not having places to sit. I wish it had more than 2 tables so that we could sit and enjoy our meal. Other than that, awesome sandwich shop!
Okay, I'm hooked! I'm going back. Enough said. TASTY TASTY TASTY, thee most TASTY sandwiches EVER!!!!!
Ike's probably suffered from over-hype, as I've heard so much about it. But I've been twice now and wasn't excited by either of my sandwiches. I had the Love Triangle and the Peg Bundy. Both were very, very messy, to the point where the bread fell apart and I couldn't eat them, and both were surprisingly bland given their great-sounding ingredients. I was disappointed (my boyfriend had the Damon Bruce and the Super Mario, and feels the same way).IMO, the best veggie sandwich in SF is the Sophie's Delight at The Sandwich Place (which is only about 6 blocks from Ike's!).
The sandwiches are good, but the line is not.I could totally dig a shorter line at Ikes.On the plus side, the chips are nice!
With places such as Ike's, I almost feel bad not giving into the hype. But then again, I don't care. Please don't get me wrong, the sandwiches I had here at Ike's were quite good. Just as good as some other sandwiches I've had.I first had the Hot Momma Huda, with halal chicken, franks red hot, ranch, and provolone. The chicken was basted with a Louisiana-style hot sauce, but not too much. The chicken was a bit luke-warm to cold. Not sure if it was done on purpose to make it primarily a cold sandwich. I would have liked that temperature contrast with the other ingredients, especially the hot sauce. The dutch crunch roll was excellent, soft and forgiving as you try to fit bite after bite into your facial orifice.Next I had the Elvis Keith. Same quips, but the wasabi mayo was a nice touch. I hear they have the Matt Cain Championship Special, which is mozzarella sticks, onion rings, and an avocado. Must get.All in all, I think this place is extremely popular because it offers so much variety, and it can please pretty much any kind of appetite.
finally tried out Ike's. came here on a Monday afternoon around 1:30 and it was PACKED. long line + after you ordered your sandwich = 1 hour 15 min wait to get it. when we first got here, i thought the location was rather odd then realized it was a temporary set up. it did suck having to wait so long, but i figured there i was in SF with time, so might as well wait and try it. [as we were waiting i thought, hmmmm this Lime place is cute... kinda would like to go there for drinks one day haha]i ordered # 1/2.. which is the Spiffy Tiffy. originally i couldn't decide what i wanted, then when i read the description of this sandwich, [Halal Chicken Breast, Pesto, Mushrooms, Avocado, Pepper Jack. Provolone] i just couldn't pass it up. ALSO, since the sandwich is called Spiffy Tiffy and my name is Tiffany, i figured it was calling out my name, so easy choice.when we finally got our sandwiches, i took a huge bite into mine and thought WOW this is pretty damn good. i told myself i wouldn't eat the whole thing, but i did..... oops. anyhow, the sandwich was really good yet really heavy. i didn't know that the chicken was going to be breaded, so i think that made it just much more fatty/filling. in my opinion, good sandwich but definitely not something i could eat on a regular basis.... i practically didn't get hungry till pretty late that day. however, i would like to come back and try another sandwich, maybe something a tad more simple next time. but glad to have checked off another place i'd like to try!
I came to this place when they moved to Lime for a temporarily time. I was excited to see what the hype was and ordered the Matt Cain. Heard that was one of their best sandwiches. Turns out I had to wait 30-45 minutes for my sandwich! My entire lunch break was basically over.I got so impatient I started eating my entire bag of chips while waiting. I took a bite into the saucy sandwich, and it was nothing but a big disappointment to me. I honestly didn't get what people were saying how this place was so "bomb". It might be the fact that I was already so impatient from the wait and my sandwich got all drenched in their sauce. They definitely packed on the meats, but I'm not usually a meat person anyways. I think I would try it again, maybe on another day when it's not so long of a wait and another sandwich.
Called in at 5:30 to order a couple of sandwiches since I was in the hood. They were slated to be ready by 6:05 - they were 5 or 10 minutes beyond that, but who cares?The two guys I dealt with were beyond friendly, and I was the only person there getting sandwiches - what the hell? I guess that's the trick - not everyone knows they're open til 7 now.Going home for the holidays and the Barack Obama whatever we ordered were AMAZING. God the dirty sauce is crack. We're seriously going to find out it's like ground up baby unicorn or something.I still want wet naps in the bag though. . . .
Went here on a weekday w/ coworker and tried to call in but they told us it would take 1 and 1/2 hours! We had like 6 samis...so we decided to wing it and come in person, line was moderate about 10 people but they are SLOW.....35 minutes and 1 parking ticket later, we got our samis. Everyone said their sami was good but for me it was GOOD but not mind blowing. The saying is right "how good can a sami be" Well its good but I dont wake up in the middle of the night craving it. If i were out for a sami and looking for a place I WOULD come here, but not to come just for GOOD food cus after all its only a sami. They load all the ingrediants into the sami and use garlic bread. After I ate my 1/2 sami I felt really gross...I had ham, salami, avacado french dressing, dirty sauce, onion rings and bacon in my sami...needless to say I had to spend extra time at the gym that night. Worth a try, but NOT worth a long wait. Go during down times.
Dammit Ike's Place. I want to love your sandwiches, I really do.The first 3 or 4 trips were a learning process, but always paid off in the end with a great tasting sandwich. Almost everything I've ordered thus far has been exceptional, despite the wait.Barry Zito is my regular go-to sandwich. The one with the mozzarella sticks (Koopa?) was a tasty treat. The pastrami is da bizzness.But my recent trip there was a bit of a disappointment. This was my first time at the new location (Lime). I phoned in my order and was surprised that my usual waiting time of ~30 mins had jumped to an hour and 20 mins. Maybe it was because of the weekend? I dunno. But when I finally arrived to pick up, another 40 mins had elapsed until I got my sandwich. A grand total of 2 hours. -1Took my sandwich home (The Gramps), hoping that it was worth every minute of waiting. It tasted good, but was overall kinda wimpy. Kinda like it was made without care. Missing a few ingredients, and overall not EPIC like I remembered. -1Regardless, I have to give it up to the team at Ike's. Exceptional customer service 100% of the time.I dont' want to say that you guys are all hype, but I hope things get a little better once you move into your new spot!
Too bad I couldn't be the 4,000th person to review this place.Ike's is badass and worth the wait. The Mnage and the Matt Cain are superb...add jalapeos! I'm a root beer fiend and Ike's serves Sioux City sarsaparilla...they don't call it the Granddaddy of all root beers for nothing!Take your sammich to the Alamo park and gaze upon the Painted Ladies ...or watch the crazy tourists!
THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!I had the tri-tip and mushroom sandwich on dutch crunch with all the extra toppings on it. It was the best sandwich i've ever eaten! It was so tasty, the bread was fresh, and the sandwich was pretty big. In addition to the delicious sandwich, Ike's gives you chips and a carmel apple sucker to eat with it. I'll be back in here soon to try the other sandwiches!
Excellent sandwich I had the Cream cheese and cucumber sandwich in dutch crunch... Oh just thinking about it makes me wan to drive over 5 hours to get another one. Ike can you please open some eateries in the So Cal area
Delicious. Not very healthy, but delicious.
I've heard so many stories about Ike's and how their sandwiches are the best. I had been so excited to try it. So anyways, we call in to order 4 sandwiches, and they specified that we wouldn't be able to pick up the sandwiches until 1pm which was an hour away which is perfectly fine since we are driving from the east/south bay. We pick up the sandwiches, then go to my friends place to eat, since there is no dining area over at Ike's. Got back, and my sandwich wasn't packed. So I told my friends to eat and I'd just snack on chips and that's it. Well I was pretty pissed about this, since i was so excited and was willing to pay 12 bucks for a sandwich. Anyways, I called the store , told them what happened and the lady with the pink hair was really extremely nice. She said she'd give me my money back with my sandwich. I definitely give this store A+++++++ for customer service. However, F- for not checking to see if the full order is three b4 giving it to the customer, which averages out. The sandwich was good. I ordered the menage a tois. It was good, but really messy. All I tasted was some lettuce tomatoes, honey and chicken on dutch crunch. I think I could definitely make this at home.I really wanted to give this place either 5 or 4 stars, but because of the incident and because of the price, I don't think I would go outta my way from the south bay to drive to get an Ike's sandwich.The other sandwiches on the menu sound delicious and if I'm in the area, I may try a different sandwich, but I wouldn't go out of my way or have cravings for this place. Its just really expensive and too busy to eat here.
This is the absolute best sandwich place I've ever eaten at. And I've been to Little Luca's in South City and Katz's Deli in NY. I had the Nacho Boy and the Big Meat Sandwich. The Dutch crunch bread is awesome and don't forget to ask for extra DIRTY SAUCE. So much meat! (That's what she said!!)
Ive been back two times since my first visit and each time I went I fell in love even more! The second time I got the menage a trois, which was soo amazing. There was so much sauce which I thought was a prefect blend of sweet and tangy (honey and bbq sauce). When I went back I split a menage a trois(because it was so amazing) and going home for thanksgiving with a friend. The Thanksgiving sandwich was also amazing. I am a huge fan of the turkey and cranberry and the cheese they use=amazzing. They also used spicy sauce so it had a spicy kick to even out the sweet of the cranberry. We called in and our sandwiches were ready when we got there and we didn't even have to wait to pay (we went at like 5 on friday, a dead-ish time since it was a little random). Love Ikes
Sorry for the delay on yelping this... How is someone with 2901 ratings and a 4.5 star overall rating desperate for attention? Well, I guess these guys are. What more could they want? When I saw this on Yelp Talk earlier this month I could not believe the gall of these guys.Ok, well I did finally eat at Ike's but at best it gets 2 stars. This so called Dirty Sauce is nothing short of an oily, greasy amalgamation of nastiness that they must add fat into it. I think I almost had an angioplasty.The flavors of the sandwich were not bad, but I wouldn't write home to tell my Mom about it and the bread was ordinary at best. I don't get all the love about this place. Please wake up!!!
Oh Paul Rubens, you were made just for me weren't you. With your creepily delicious dutch crunch bread and flirty red cabbage coleslaw, you seduce me every time. Your veggies are so crisp and flavorful. And when you are extra dirty is when I like you the best. I love sandwiches. I like like sandwiches. When I found this place I thought I had died and gone to god's deli. More words will cheapen this so, if you go here you will be one step closer to true enlightenment.
Ike's is sandwiched [pun intended] between two of my childhood schools: Sanchez Elementary and Everett Middle School. Now, if this was in existence some 20 years ago [totally dating myself] I can only imagine how much more awesome my primary education could have been!(Actually, I would have probably failed third grade due to an uncontrollable urge to cut class and eat a sandwich, but whatever. I would have been an 11-year-old 3rd-grader with awesome taste in sandwiches.)
The experience. How do I explain it? ....like an orgasm in my mouth? Yep. That's it.After much planning, we reserved a day to go and try these critically acclaimed sandwiches. We took Bart to Powell and walked from there to Ike's since we had about 45 mins to kill before our sandwiches would be ready (insert tip: call order in ahead of time; the wait is very long)I got the Joker which consists of: beef meatbaaaallls, fried zucchini, red pesto sauce and ranch. It came with a bag of Dirty Potato chips and a drink... So heavenly. There is no seating area in Ike's and there is no seating area on the sidewalks. So we walked into some alley and sat down on a creepy door step. LOL. It was worth it.
It was my turn to treat my brother to lunch, so last week I chose Ike's Place. The first time I tried Ike's was a year ago. I love anything with bacon and avocado, so that first time I ordered the "16th & market" sammie. This was when Ike Shehadeh was the only person working in the kitchen. He made the most perfectly assembled (uniform and well packed, nothing spilling out, not too much sauce) and DEElicious shredded chicken (moist) sammie I've ever tasted. Since then he's added more assistants to manage the demand. I love many of the sandos, but I cannot say that I like every sammie in the menu. It has a wide variety of choices to appeal to every taste, and be warned that some sammies can be more sloppy/ messy than normal. Notable in the menu is the long list of vegan/ vegetarian options. I was a fan of any of the chicken sammies (they use shredded chicken white meat, but on a few recent visits the meat was not as moist as in the past), now I like the turkey burger better. For people with smaller appetites, one sammie is good enough for 2 people. If u prefer a less messy/greasy sammie, I would say ask for no Dirty Sauce (blasphemy, I know).It's difficult to find parking in this area, and it's too popular during lunch time. So to avoid a long wait, I would recommend to come after the lunch rush or place an order by phone. They'll give u an estimated pickup time. There's only 3 tables outside so most orders are to go.Note for newbies, they also have baked fries (note that I said "baked", I didn't say low fat). Not crunchy but still addictive, seasoned w/red pepper or paprika. They're not listed in the menu. And now available on small & large sizes.Large "bucket" of baked fries:yelp.com/biz_photos/doldDipping sauces - I like the honey mustard sauce:yelp.com/biz_photos/dold#12 "Jon-El's TB" - turkey burger:yelp.com/biz_photos/dold#16 "16th & market" - chicken, avocado & bacon:yelp.com/biz_photos/doldTootsie Roll lollipops that come with every order:yelp.com/biz_photos/dold
Like Ike's needs anyone else singing their praises, but holy wow the sandwiches are FUCKING DELICIOUS. I had "the joker", meatballs, fried zucchini, red pesto, and ranch on dutch crunch. It is a party in your mouth and everyone is invited. Their dutch crunch bread is fantastic. I don't know if it was just because it was toasted to perfection but it was the best dutch crunch bread I've ever had. Crunchy outside, warm, soft and chewy inside. Sort of pricey, and a bit of wait but totally worth it.I wasn't even that hungry (second dinner) and I went to town on that bad boy. It is that good.
This is the restaurant that all future sandwiches will be judged by.It was out of this world. In an unassuming location on 16th, just south of Market you will find Ike's Place. It is slightly industrial inside, with very little seating, and clear rules on which side of the line you need to go (place an order on one side, and phone in/pick-up on the other).I ordered the Pizzle, which was Halal chicken, bacon, ranch, and cheddar on their amazing Famous bread. It was out of this world. The chicken was moist and tasty and full of flavor. It had the appropriate ratio of bacon and ranch and every bite was pure heaven. It was also the perfect size.My husband had the Lincecum, start with turkey and havarti and you had me at hello, add bacon avocado and ham and you have a fantastic sandwich.They are priced a little high, but its San Francisco, and they all come with a bag of chips, which were great kettle cooked Dirty Chips. So people kwitcherbitchen.Their only downfall, and this is the downfall of any good restaurant was no fountain soda, which means no refills, so that means can soda, and 12 oz of refreshment is never enough. But the food was so good, they keep their 5 stars. CANNOT wait to go back and try more of their menu (one day I'll tackle the Kryptonite)
Yay good sandwiches! The menu can be overwhelming, so get there early before the lunch rush and be decisive.I had the Jerry's Big Meat Sandwich w/ dirty sauce and everything on it. Yum. I like that they make nice even layers of sandwich meat and fillings. Nothing sloppy about this joint until you're done eating a huge sandwich and have sauce all over your face :)
If a place is rated over 4 stars with almost 3000 reviews, I think I should try it. Unfortunately, so does the entire bay area population. We put our name on the list and waited 30 min just to order. Then another 40 min to get our food. Why weren't we smart yelpers and PHONE IN our order?? Thank god for the bars around the area that made the wait a little bit better.BUT I see why Ike's is so popular! We got the Nacho Boy (roast beef, mushrooms, avocado, swiss, and DIRTY SAUCE) and the Legend of Zelda (beef meatballs, battered zuccini, pepperjack cheese, and marinara) on Dutch Crunch and they were BOMB. The dirty sauce (some kind of garlic aioli) will make any sandwich. The Legend of Zelda sounds like a meatball marinara from Subway, but the beer battered zuccini stuffed inside change it up. And the bread was thick and soft and yummy. I definitely want to go back and try more sandwiches from their EXTENSIVE menu--they have pages and pages of vegetarian, vegan, and meat options. Most sandwiches are $8-12 and come with a bag of Dirty chips and a caramel apple pop. But I have learned my lesson-- CALL IN FOR PICKUP
Ike's is back on track - kudos to Ike for resolving all his location problems and kudos to Ike for making it up to the people (like myself) who were disappointed by the situation at Lime. It might just be the food coma afterglow talking, but this is the best instance I've seen of a merchant using Yelp to "fix" customer satisfaction problems. Other business owners/managers should take heed.
I'm a 16th Street OG and I am so disappointed at what used to be my favorite sandwich place ever. A SF legend. When I ordered the Kryptonite today, I received 2 regular sized sandwiches (just like the same one I received at Redwood Shores Ike's Place, and Cupertino location). I remember the golden days; when the Kryptonite actually meant at least 5 inches of heaven and this massiveness in girth covered in dirtyyy sauce. It took me 3 days to eat an entire Kryptonite. THREE DAYS. Now, the Kryptonite is more of a meal for two. I really feel like one of those couples who totally fall out of love with their husbands. Asking myself, where did the love go? Remember our first time, Ike's Place? When I was waiting in the cold for 2 hours for you? How Ike handed me the menu and offered to add onion rings to the Kryptonite for 2 bucks more? What happened? And CUT! I am really happy for Ike that he made it into such a mega franchise. There is an Ike's place everywhere. But I am sad that it won't ever be like the first time again. Sniff sniff. :(As Ryan R. said, "The sandwich i had today was not the sandwich i had 3 years ago. Not the same sandwich that made me go back the day after."
Great sandwiches! The line can be long so call ahead.
First visit and I was really really impressed. I got the We're just friends....SOOO GOOD. I will be returning to eat there again with a really big appetite!!!!
Have y'all seen the boys and girls that make your sandwiches?it looks like they haven't taken showers in weeks! And why do hipsters wait for hours for one of those sandwiches? I guess smelly, unkempt Tweens stick together! Just don't trust the oil on your sandwich...it's probably dripped from the sandwich maker's hair!
What can I say that hasn't already been said?The 7x7 list has been largely disappointing for me, but not the Ike's Menage a Trois. This IS a sandwich you should try before you die. The combination is unexpectedly, astoundingly, beautifully delicious.It's the best sandwich I've ever had. Protip: Call in your order and they'll let you know what time to pick it up. Saves you from waiting in those looong lines. Also, if you go get your sandwich at odd hours, you don't have to wait too long either.
400+ reviews on Yelp, so I decided to come here with special friend and see for myself what the hype was all about. I ordered the "Ex-Boyfriend" (salami, bacon, avos & cheddar). I was quite excited since I LOVE salami & avos. We called in for our orders and the lady said it was going to be 45 minutes. Wow, really? Anyway, we waited, picked up our order and realized there was no line at the store. So what was with the 45 minute wait? Who knows. We brought the sandwiches back home and I realized....THEY FORGOT TO ADD IN AVOCADOS. OMG. OMG. OMG. WTF. WTF. WTF!!!!!!!!!!! I know it's not that big of a deal but I was really disappointed since this was my first time at Ike's, and after all the hype that Yelp brought, I did have expectations. I'm extremely disappointed. Ike's should make every sandwich as if it's going to a first time customer. You can't expect me to pay for avos then jip me of it. That's wrong. Absolutely wrong.Despite the fact that the sandwich lacked avos, it was still really good, I'm very disappointed in paying for something I didn't receive. Maybe the stars will go up when Ike's comes clean and gives me all the ingredients on my sandwich. I'm going to revisit them sometime soon. Had they remembered my avos, I would def. give it 5 stars.(Photos uploaded)
This place is legendary. Perhaps the best sandwiches I have EVER had! To top it off their sandwiches are made with gluten-free bread. :]
So of course I had to come here after the Man vs. Food episode in SF. I would have given this place 5 stars, but timing was the reason why I deducted one star. So we thought it would be a smart idea to call ahead and order the sandwiches in advance. We both tried calling at the same time and both got put on hold. I think I was on hold for 15 min and still no answer, then lost reception in the elevator. Anywho, we tried for the third and placed our order right away. We were told 20 min. We got there just as our 20 min was up. However we witnessed people walking up and ordering and those people got their sandwiches waayyyy before we did. I think we waited for an additional 15 min. Other than that....the sandwiches are FRIKN awesome. There is something in that dirty sauce that will put you into a SERIOUS food coma.
This little sandwich shop blew away all expectations out the window, it was amazing. I tried about 5 sandwiches, taking bites here and there from the friends I went with. To start, the ordering process is quite simple. They have about 20 sandwiches to choose from, then you choose the type of bread, then adding extras into the sandwich. The regular sandwiches come with a bag of chips, while the Kryptonite does not. ( but there is a reason why )To begin, I ordered the Hot Momma: On a simple white bread with lettuce. It was amazing! It had a very nice combination of both kick and mellow. The ranch was a great balance to the buffalo sauce. The "halal" chicken is just a fancy way of saying "grown and killed humanly". Overall, a great sandwich for anyone who loves buffalo sauce in their sandwiches.The next is their most famous, the Kryptonite! Many might have heard about this sandwich on T.V., because this shop was visited by Man Vs. Food. Their challenge sandwich is a MUST for any meat lover! It is about the size of a man's forearm, but packed with meat and more meat! On top of that, other things like onion rings and 3 cheeses. If you're daring to challenge this beast, a warning must be in place. It's quite expensiveMy favorite by far was the Menage A Trios. This was an amazing combination of everything! This place really knows how to put chicken and sauce into one little bite! The chicken is the same "halal" chicken, but because of the different sauces in each burger, their texture changes. The chicken in this sandwich melts in your mouth because the chicken absorbs the sauces, causing a very easy eat! I took about 3 bites from my friend, and it made me regret getting the Hot Momma ( Which I thought was an AMAZING sandwich )Overall, the best sandwich joint in town! ( possibly in all of California )
After realizing all the hype on this place, I had to drop my rating to a 3.I ordered the spliffy tiffy (halal chicken, pesto, avocado, mushrooms, pepper jack, provolone, plus the reg fixins of dirty sauce, tom, and lettuce) on dutch crunch. Overall, the sandwich was yummy- good flavor. A little too much mayo taste, maybe this batch of dirty sauce needed more flavoring? My biggest complaint has to be with the cheese. I know they melt it-- and I ordered ahead (45 minute wait for a pickup on a weekend lunch hour)... so maybe the cheese melted off the sandwich? My point is the sandwich was supposed to have 2 different kinds of cheese and I could have sworn there were none. My friend ordered [your favorite sesame street character] - a veggie medley sandwich, and asked to add onions and add cheddar. Charged for the cheddar, the cheddar never made it.  Onions were very very scarce. For 10 bucks a sandwich and almost an hour wait, there shouldnt be mistakes like those.Suffice to say we were disappointed, but I love sandwiches and this places has a good thing going... would really like to try another round, maybe wait in the godawful line or come at some downtime hours.
First, I get a somewhat random recommendation from a friend about this place, and then checking it here, I see that another friend has given it high praise. So, my next trip to the city, I had to try it because I love me a good sammich.Parking's a little tough in this neighborhood (or city), but it's right on Market in the Castro- and be warned, it's hard to see from the street. Make sure you've found the right block before you put money in the meter!The walk-in and order process is a bit awkward, but once you're ordering the staff is very helpful and friendly. The seating situation is also slightly difficult. This place is a bar at some point during the day or evening, and that makes for less-than-intuitive sandwich shop seating. Also, for some reason, a dining area further back in the restaurant was closed off. Seemed weird considering the line of people.Once you sit and get your food, fugedaboutit! Meat, cheese, dressings and sauces between delicious bread- it's a spiritual journey. Perusing the menu, I wasn't sure if any of the combinations sounded amazing, but I found "The Ex Boyfriend" to be a good assembly of ingredients: Salami, bacon, avocado, American cheese. The result was unreal. I couldn't not finish every bite even though I was pretty full towards the end. Delicious beyond expectations.Thanks Ryan and Scott!Bottom line: Ya like sammiches? Go to Ike's.
Yummmmmmmmmy selection of memorable sandwiches.
Don't believe all the hype. Ike's is nothing special. I really cannot understand where all the 5-star reviews are coming from, because our experience was "meh" at best. I wanted to love Ike's. I really did. But what's to love?Our experience began a week earlier when we saw Ike's on the Food and/or Travel channel. We then checked out their website and planned which sandwiches we would like to try. Because we were so blown away by the menu choices, we vowed to drive up to San Francisco the following weekend.Leaving Palmdale (Southern California) at 5:00am, we managed to arrive at Ike's around 11:00am. I had hoped to arrive no later than this in order to avoid the crowds. Seriously, we just drove directly from our house to Ike's, covering 380 miles and stopping once for gas.We had the good sense to call in our order ahead of time, just as we were getting through the San Jose area. And it was a good thing too, because Ike's didn't pick up the phone the first 6 times we called. Attempt number 7, and we finally got through. We were now about 30 minutes away and closing in fast. Ike's put us on hold for another 5 or 6 minutes (seriously, that's a long time to be on hold for a restaurant). We finally managed to place our order for 3 sandwiches (1 each and 1 to split later).We arrived outside Ike's about 20 minutes after placing the order, but then it took another 10 minutes of driving around trying to find parking. We finally found a street spot where we were blocking someone's driveway, but the garage door looked old and disused, so we figured the driveway was not in use. Most apartments had a "do not block driveway" sign, but we found one without.Walking around the corner to Ike's, it was 11:00am on a Saturday and we found Lime to be completely full with loud thumping music and long lines of club-goers outside. This at 11:00am? Really? Really, San Francisco? I've never seen a club busy at 11 o'clock in the morning in any other city before, but whatever. I won't rant about the music or the club scene, because I can deal with that and I just wanted to get some delicious food. After trying to convince the bouncer to let me skip the line because I was just picking up sandwiches -- really, this place seems like 95% nightclub and 5% sandwich shop -- I managed to get inside and find a cash register. The guy behind the counter gave me an attitude for not tipping. A tip? For what? It was already $38 for just three medium-sized sandwiches. I thought tips were supposed to be given for good service, but okay...The guy had commented that our order just came up, and I could feel the bag was warm, so we decided to take our food up to Twin Peaks to enjoy the view and the warm sun that day. It was an 8-minute drive, so the food was still warm when we ate.The sandwiches were just so-so. Pretty much Subway fare, with some onion rings and other stuff added. We got 3 of the most highly recommended sandwiches from the Yelp reviews, each on Dutch Crunch, and each with extra dirty sauce. Despite following all of these recommendations, there was really nothing special about the food at all.I wanted to love Ike's. Otherwise, I would not have driven for 6 hours to try it. But I guess we had just set our expectations too high. If you want an average sandwich, go to Ike's. But be prepared for a long wait and a strange an unwelcoming type of service. If you at least want to be treated well and get decent service, go to some mom-and-pop sandwich deli. You might also find better food there too. If you want a safe bet, go to Subway.
Woohoo! As good as it gets! I have searched far and wide for the most awesome sandwich shop and this is it! As far as what to order: "Hot Momma Huda" and add mozzarella sticks or try the amazing "Elvis Keith"
Ike's is probably the best sandwich joint I've ever been to.And that's saying a LOT.On the first night of our San Fran trip, we chose to visit Ike's for sandwiches. Best. decision. ever. And totally worth going out of our way on the muni. My husband got the vegan "captain corey", which was orange-glazed veg chicken with avocado, lettuce, tomato & onion. They were out of vegan cheese, so we got it without (I'm not always a fan of vegan cheeses anyway, unless they're daiya... but I digress!). This sandwich was super good! He loved it, and I really liked the half I had.That said, the Pilgrim really stole my heart. This sandwich, with a little vegan turkey (I don't always like faux meats, but this one was so good), cranberry sauce, tomracha sauce (their take on sriracha), and a little lettuce, was absolute perfection. It was a little spicy, a little sweet, and enough savory. O M G it was good. I could seriously eat this sandwich every day.Also, be sure and get the sandwiches on Dutch Crunch! It's a SF treat, cause it doesn't seem to exist many other places. Their version at Ike's is vegan, too :) yay. Anyway, ever since our meal at Ike's, I've been left wanting more. I almost, ALMOST suggested we go back there for one last sandwich before leaving. But there are so many other good vegan options in SF that I wanted to try others. I'm still sad we didn't get another Ike's sandwich...Until next time, Ike's!
This place is as good as it gets for Sandwiches in the Bay. OMG... It was pain in the ass to find parking, but once we did my friends and I made a Trek to Ike's I ordered a Change. (thinly sliced steak, onion rings, bbq and Gouda) The man took my name and informed me that I stumbled upon their happy hour, so I got a free drink and free chips. SCORE!. The place was fairly busy but my sandwich came out 5-8 minutes and they announced my name, that's excellent customer service.  As I bit into my sandwich it almost was better than Moxie's Mafia Meatball in Sac. BBQ sauce was slathered together with juicy meat and creamy Gouda, the vegtables were fresh and crip and completed a fantastic meal to top it off I got wet naps and a sucker for dessert hahaha.Next time I got there I'm going to try something with their dirty sauce.
Sorry but giving 5 stars makes me nervous and puts a lot of weight on my shoulders.I thought my first experience was going to be horrible because they did not have ANY avocados. When I took that first bite, boy OR girl was I wrong.Small place very small. Huge menu. Everything seemed scattered and random, but it all has it's place. Love the fact they use post-its for their order tags. I LOVE POST-ITS!! Keep your eyes wide open because when you think you know what you are going to order, another hand-drawn sandwich sign looks so DELICIOUS. When I went there was a wait and it was only 1:30 pm!!! Prepare yourself to stare at the menu for at least 7 to 12 minutes because it is huge. OR you can come prepared by checking the menu online.I had the "Sorry Charlie" which I really felt like because they didn't have any avocados, and my friend had the "Superman" which kinda looked like....well check the picture out. I don't suggest these BECAUSE I need to try more sandwiches, but these were really good.I need to go back and you need to stop reading this review and GO!!!
absolutely LOOVE ike's! their sandwiches are so unique...and whatever that dirty sauce it...is AMAZING! sometimes it's kind of a hit or miss tho. either the sandwiches are super fat with everything all dirty and piled on, or they're kinda skimpy. now, don't get me wrong...the skimpy is still amazing but you get what i mean. i HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone who wants a different kind of sandwich experience. you won't regret it!
Best sandwich place!
best sandwiches. hands down. I get the Pizzle - Dutch Crunch is a must!
$30 for 2 sammiches, water and chips....mamas not happy. The location is terrible, the entry way is too small and i felt in the way the whole time.Bad chip abd drink selection, i mean really? Who doesnt havw bbq chips or juice?Also the chairs at the bar have srains on them from liquid and since theyre on the seat im grossed out thinking what they could be from.
I tried the mnage a trio's sandwich and my boyfriend had the nacho boy sandwich. The mnage a trio's sandwich was DELICIOUS! The ingredients were halal chicken, real honey, honey mustard, BBQ, pepper jack, Swiss, and cheddar. Which was SOOO GOOD!The Nacho boy tasted okay... I took a few bite off of my boyfriend's sandwich. The ingredients are roast beef, mushrooms, avocado, and Swiss. But the sandwich tasted plain.Nevertheless, I'm a bit disappointed that they don't serve fries. However, they gave away kettle chips when you purchase a sandwich.I still need to try other Ike's sandwiches before I give them more stars because I had a sandwich at Quiznos that tasted just as good as the mnage a trios.
Finally got to go to this place and all I have to say is... Delicious! Seriously you don't have to say anything more. Go visit the place and get ready for a mouth orgasm!P.S. Service is super friendly and makes you want to come back.
Ike in pink. Sandwiches in 15.Much has changed with Ike's move to a new location a few doors down. Mostly good. Just one expensive bad.The good: Legendary for good reason. One of the best sandwiches you'll ever have. My veggie meatball, oozing with marinara sauce on a wheat roll, only confirmed that.More good: Dirty sauce and suckers still come standard.Even more good: With the new space comes more room to prepare. The hour wait is now down to about 15min.Final good: In honor of Pride weekend, Ike was wearing pink.The bad: Prices have gone up. A lot. The above epicness will now cost you $10, and that cost Ike a star.Sorry man. Still love you and your sandwiches. And the pink outfit.
Do you smell what Barack is cooking?It was like a bbq feast in the form of a sandwich. Sauce on my hands, sauce on my face, napkins everywhere. Not bad, but also not so amazing that I'd go out of my way to get it. The gouda was a very nice addition to the sandwich. However, there was a little bit of an overkill on the bbq sauce. If you're in the area and want to try this place, PHONE IN YOUR ORDER. Most of the people in line don't know what they're in line for (lol). Veterans have learned that there's a long ass line for people to place an order, but if you've already phoned it in then you jump to the front to pay and pick up.
I Love Ikes! His sandwiches are great and it was awesome because i used to frequent the place pretty regulary when they were at church and market kind of and he actually learned my name after two visits, i mean, THATS PRETTY AWESOME! haha, so i was impressed. did i mention? THE SANDWICHES ARE BOMB TOO! hehe
My friend JC suggested we check out this place since he liked it so much the first time he went with his wife. We finally found it after they moved locations. The sandwiches were original and very tasty. Pricing was a bit high for sandwiches but I guess that's SF pricing for you.Dutch Crunch Bread is a MUST!!! You cannot go wrong with the the Damon Bruce sandwich.
Normally I wouldn't even bother writing a review since I agree with most of what's been said - yes, Ike's has just not the best sandwich I've ever had, but probably takes the top three spots, and more will come the more I go there, I'm sure.So, I won't elaborate on how wonderful it is - just check out the other reviews - instead, I'll mention that there have been 2 sandwiches I've had there that didn't live up to the others (I'm sure they'd be standouts anywhere else). 1) I had a bite of an Unoriginal pastrami, and it was ok, but not great. This might partially be because the pastrami isn't the best pastrami I've ever had, and also, the real beauty of Ike's sandwiches is the synergy of all of the ingredients coming together in perfect proportion. So, choose one of the sandwiches they've put together, rather than making your own, is my suggestion. 2) The Damn Straight is not as great if it sits around for a while (my own fault for picking it up late). The cheese sticks congeal and I think there's not enough marinara sauce - it all soaks into the bread.Sorry this dwells on the negative, because everything else I've had has been mindblowing. The hardest part is ordering a different sandwich each time because the last one was always perfect.
Yummy sandwiches! I have yet to try'em all..... hopefully someday I will be able to try all of it :D
Born and raised in SF, I think I'm qualified to say: Both Sub Center and Roxie's kick Ike's ass any day and errrday!
I ate here 2 years ago and still think about my sandwich (a mind-blowing concoction of chicken parmesan, mozzarella sticks, and sriracha) on a regular basis. It's become the sandwich by which other sandwiches are compared. I think we got there at 2:30 or something so we probably missed the line.Absolutely worth the hype. Hoping to one day sample some other delights from their deep offering.
This update is long overdue. Shortly after this review the owner wrote me a very friendly and cordial message saying a new location opened up in SF. I think that gives you some food for thought. The owners of these establishments really take into consideration all the reviews because it lets them know where to improve and what they're doing right and thus, what they should continue doing.I will be visiting you Ike to take you up on the offer. I really do love the Hot Mamma Hudda (sp?). Because of Ike's I found new joy in eating sandwiches.
I've had Ike's two times. The first time was 2-3 years ago when I had my wisdom teeth taken out a week before I decided to try Ike's, and the second was just last week when my sister brought a sandwich home. There was a huge hype 2-3 years ago because they were about to close down, so even IF I just had my wisdom teeth taken out, I just had to experience how delicious the sandwiches were! I had the menage a trois, which was alright--I don't remember exactly what I thought then. But the Matt Cain I had last week was yum-my! My sister even received a free drink because they said Matt Cain was pitching that day. Unlike other sandwich shops which may completely forget about the quality of their bread, Ike's clearly makes an effort to make the bread taste and texture great. I couldn't stop taking bites, it's no ordinary sandwich! Just like their sandwich paper bag says--it's finger-lickin' good.I can't comment on service because I haven't stopped by often enough. But the first time, I called in under the name Winnie. When I arrived, the worker took a loong time to locate my order because they wrote down Brittany instead... Eh, oh well. Doesn't deter me from coming back. Definitely will be back when hopefully the line isn't so long.
Updating my review for the new Lime location. At first I was like, huh? Ikes sandwiches plus the bright white and hot pink interior of Lime and some loungey music coming out of the speakers? This just does not jive.But then I was like, dude. I get to sit while I wait for my sandwich. Then I get to sit while I eat it, and not on some janky Dolores Park bench that some dude has probably urinated on.Thumbs up! Also, sign their petition to make sure their new location opens in a month!
Why do I live so far away from San Francisco??Sandwiches are my FAVORITE FOOD. Does that even count? Doesn't matter, because to me, it does. I love good sandwiches. I love the sandwiches at Ike's Place. I love the dirty sauce. After visiting this location about 5ish times (including their new location in SF, sharing a bar space), I've come to love a few sandwiches. I'm not sure if they still offer them or if I've had them more than once or what - there are just too many - but the ones I can remember having (and loving) is the menage a trois, the al bundy and the name of the girl im dating. I think. I really try to get a new one each time, but I think I've failed at that so far. Doesn't matter because you can't go wrong!Dutch Crunch bread and Funky Fusion chips FTW.
sandwich is the best food in the world, lol
amazing. the BEST meal we had when visiting SF. fiance and i found this place using yelp, but it had the bonus of also being featured in "man vs. food" - fiance's favorite show of all time. i had the menage a trois (Halal Chicken Breast, Real Honey, Honey Mustard, BBQ, PepperJack, Swiss, Smoked Gouda) because i looove salty sweet things. fiance had the superman (Roast Beef, Corned Beef, Pastrami, Salami, Turkey, Bacon, Ham, Avocado, Jack for a whopping $15.50) because he likes huge servings and MEAT. we were able to eat half of this for lunch one day, and finish the rest for another meal the next day. both sandwiches were on the dutch crunch bread - oh my WORD, i wish they had this bread available in nyc! so soft and chewy inside, covered with this amazing crust. the complimentary potato chips that come with each sandwich is also a great pairing. :) i got the jalapeno, fiance got the salt and vinegar!one random note: Ike's is the sandwich place, Lime is the bar that it serves lunch out of! had no idea till we showed up. had that "spilt alcohol" smell to the place, so it's not the nicest place to actually eat, but the sandwich is so good and the service so friendly that i don't really care. also, this place is POPULAR. took about 20 minutes before we got our sandwiches.
got the "name of the girl i'm dating" cause who can resist such a babe ;) kind of bummed because i had to pack it for a road trip and didn't get to taste it in its freshly made glory. also, since the sauces were in containers, took some mad maneuvering to get it fully on the sandwich and not so much on the rental. it was tricky, to say the least. it did however let me fully taste the famous "dirty sauce" which was some kind of garlic aioli + crack. SO GOOD. anyway, 5hrs later, the sandwich was still delicious. sadly could only finish like half of it, since it was huge.
HOOOLLLYYYY CRAP! THIS PLACE MAKES ON HELLOVA SAMMICH!Every time I bring a friend here for the first time they're response with their first bite can be summed up as "Daayuum!! ....nom nom nom!). What follows is always complete peace and harmony between mouth and belly. There's usually not much speaking after the first bite. No one is willing to stop eating to make any conversation. The enjoyment of the sandwich is way more important than anything you could say at the moment short of "do you want to get another one to go?"
Best sandwich in the city. Rivals Michael Sourdoughs for you Marin locals. No where to sit, long line but it is worth it. I would come back weekly if i could. Everything looks amazing. I like the Matt Cain but i want to try all of them.
Creative selection, wonderful sandwiches, and friendly employeesI've heard of this place so many times, seen this on man vs food, and had hipsters recommended this place to me. I am usually a fan of old fashioned sandwiches like a "no bs" roasted beef sandwich with mustard. I've been scammed by those sub-par Quiznos and Togo with their soggy sandwiches. I guess thats what been discouraging me from trying "creative sandwiches".I happened to be in Castro after meeting up with someone. I remembered this place is around so I decided to give it a try. Walked in with absolutely no expectation and no idea what to order. I told the lady it was my first time and she was super excited to walk me thru the menu. I took her advice on getting "Menage a Trois" on dutch crunch. Had the chip in the "funky" flavor and a bottle of root beer. Turned out to be around $15. Ten minutes later, another joyful staff with a huge smile on his face handed me the sandwich. Bread crunchy, sauces flavorful yet I can still taste every ingredient inside the sandwich. Chips is much much much better than the doritos you get from subway. Conclusion- it's a pretty smart business model- if you like the sandwich you tried, then come back again for more. You didn't like this sandwich? well come again and try another one. Every staff over there is wonderful. If you asked them for recommendations, they will really take some time and figure something out that suits your taste. Other sandwiches on the menu are all very creative and I am sure you will find something you like. The only complaint I have with Ike's is the size of the sandwich. It's not grossly small for an adult, but with a $10 price tag I actually expect a much bigger sandwich.
While living on the east coast for a couple of years, I often times ate at a a very popular sand which place called "Potbellies sandwhich works" and they served hot and toasty, not to mention stuffed sandwiches that were always fresh and tasty. Well after trying Ike's, I have to say theirs is the closest thing to a pot belly's or any really good sandwich place, that not only fills you but leaves you with plenty of leftovers for later. Some sandwiches come as a combo and include chips and a drink, or you can get that by paying 50 cents extra. Oh and they give you those caramel apple lolly pops with your order!
Very delicious vegetarian and vegan sandwiches: Hearty, heavy, saucy, with lots and lots of of ingredients dripping out so have many napkins nearby as it is required to be physically and mentally prepared to consume an Ike's sandwich ;)We'll definitely go back again, but not too often. I can't imagine the sandwiches here are too healthy (carbs, fats, processed imitation meat). It's so saturated with flavor and ingredients it feels like a sin almost to enjoy Ike's more than once a year ;) But if/when you are in a mood for a very delicious and filling sandwich Ike's is the place to go.
By the beard of Zeus! This place is good. I waited one hour in line and then ran to find a sit-down spot, squealing like a little girl on the first night of Hanukkah eager to spin the dreidel, because I was THAT excited to eat my sandwich...nom nom nom....BTW, Vegan meatball sub, uhhhhh yes please!!!!!!!!!!!
I hope I don't get tarred and feathered for this but I think Ike's is WAY overrated. Whenever my friends come up to the city they always wanna come here, and everytime I wonder what the hype is for. The lines are long and their sandwiches are expensive and soggy. The dirty sauce is delicious but not enough to earn a five star review. Sorry Ike's!
For my first visit, I was convinced to buy a Paul Reuben on dutch crunch bread . Since I was skeptical of a $9.99 priced sandwich, it was good to know that the bag of kettle style chips came with the price. Tack on my bottle of water for an additional buck and I was good to go. After the first bite, I agreed that it was a very good tasting sandwich. After the second bite, I could not think of another sandwich that tasted 'better'. That alone justifies my 5 star rating, forget the price. If I considered the price, and if yelp would let me, I would rate Ike's a 4.5, since I was happy enough getting a sandwich and chips from Panera at under 8 bucks (3 to 4 stars depending on location and sandwich).Don't let the rating and number of reviews hype it up for you, I would have to advise you to go and see (taste) it for yourself.
I love Ike's, specifically their menage a trois. So good!Usually I order through the Ike's app, which makes the process much easier. I highly recommend ordering ahead. When I plan to get Ike's, I usually look forward to it all day. The last thing I would want to do in that scenario is wait in a long line. Luckily I have never gone when there was a huge wait.
Worst sandwich place ever. I ordered to go and always got the bad attitude from cashiers in this sandwich place. Also, they put me on hold for 20mins then told me the sandwich won't ready in 40 mins "because they are busy". If you are busy, should have given a notice to phone calling customers in the first place. Instead, made me wait for you say something after 20mins. This is not how the business work. Of course, one star for you.
Took me awhile to try one of their sandwiches because of the ridiculous line and wait just for a sandwich. I placed a call for pick up one day and it was quick and easy. I tried the Matt Cain. It was good. Everything complemented each other well. I hope to try other sandwiches in the future if Im ever in the area. Good but not good to where you wait 3-4 hours for them to make a sandwich. I've been never successful ordering from the old location, but this new location seems efficient and ready to take on this crazy, hipster crowd.
The Meatless Mikes is the best sandwich I have ever had in the world. I'm not even slightly exagggerating.
Cola. So as much as I love Cola I've decided that I don't like the one they sell at Ike's so I'll probably never get it again. Even though they use real sugar it's a little too sweet for my taste and makes my stomach feel super full and heavy after my Ike's meal as a result. Funky Fusion Chips. Came with sandwich. Super yummy. It has an interesting flavor that's kind of like sour cream but sweet with a hint of onion at the same time. Kind of reminds me of Maui Onion chips.Menage a Trois. Sandwich with Halal Chicken, Real Honey, Honey Mustard, BBQ Sauce, Pepper Jack, Swiss, Cheddar, Lettuce and Tomato. Hands down, the best bbq chicken sandwich I've ever tasted. I never thought a sweet yet smokey tasting chicken sandwich would bring such joy to my tummy. But it did, and now I understand what the fuss about the menage a trois is. And it's so worth the hype, I'd like another menage a trois please!
Call in service is the best way to avoid lines and piss off the neighbors. I enjoyed my (favorite sesame street character) sandwich, very interesting mix of avocado and cream cheese. Now onto the service, Ike himself is running orders to and from the kitchen to waiting customers inside, with a smile and thank you to everyone. However, back in the store he is the most unprofessional individuals I've seen work. He is telling some story filled with curses in full view of several customers and myself to an employee. While ike's worker is telling him to lower his voice, he tenaciously finishes his story cursing like sailor in the process. Stay classy Ike. The other employees at Ike's are genuinely nice and accommodating. Ike's place3506 16th St
Got the Menage A Trois and I was MIND BLOWN. Seriously, orgasm in my mouth was happening.The sandwich itself had a bbq taste to it. Definitely loved that! Can't wait to try the rest of the sandwiches here!I recommend calling 20-30 minutes before you pickup your order (THE WAIT HERE IS RIDICULOUS! You're seriously saving yourself 30mins-1hr wait time if you call in advance!!!)
I'm writing an update to my earlier review. Ike was really nice and did everything he could to rectify the bad experience I had years ago, accidentally was served meat. He kept in touch and promised a free sandwich. It took me a while to go back but when I did I called him up and he delivered. I had the new, to me, Ugly Owl vegetarian sandwich. It was awesome and big enough for two meals. Thank Ike for being great with customer service!
I went roaming around the city exploring the world of SF pre-schools. Man! these school are the coolest things for kids...if you can afford pre-school, go back! even if your 39, like me!I was starving but I had no time to devour anything as I had other appointments. So I ran to Ike's to get some sandwiches to consume at a later time. I had the "Home for Thanksgiving".If I could give Ike's a 4.5, I'd do it because of the discontinuation of my seafood sandwich sandwich (the Chippers Fave). Regardless the 5 is deserved. Mike - ZZZZZ...i was in a food coma...after waking up, I gave it a 5.
CAUTION:Watch out for the dirty sauce. You can spice it up and call it aioli, but it's still mayonnaise in lipstick. And they slather it on everything turning an otherwise awesome (and possibly healthy) sandwich into a soggy, drippy mess with the fat content of a big mac super value meal - that cost you ten bucks. The employees are super nice. And you get free chips. Which is nice, cuz like I said, it cost you ten bucks.
Here is how it works. Wait in line, decide which of their 15 or so sandwiches you choose to indulge on, order from the friendly staff, pick your chips and wait for your name to be called. The sandwiches are a descent size for the cost (about $11 for the sandwich, chips and a water), packed full of good food and fresh. Def better than some of the lame corner store sandwiches you can encounter. Worth stopping by, for sure. Note: There is no place to sit so you can either take your food home or enjoy it outside at one of the near by parks.
Amazingly yummy sandwiches, free chips and lollipop, reasonable price and friendly service. What more can you ask for? Absolutely Delicious! I got the Matt Cain, but I'm sure any sandwich from their menu would be good; everything looks and smells amazing. $9-12 is not bad for a scrumptious sandwich you could stretch into 2 meals plus chips and candy. My teeny tiny itty bitty almost irrelevant complaints are that there is nowhere to sit, (being in a busy area) and the bread isn't as good as it used to be. I much prefer Roxie's Dutch Crunch as it is more fluffy and crunchy. But Ike's has more unique sandwiches whereas Roxie's is more traditional. Just depends on what you prefer.A tip for any good sandwich: leave it alone for a few hours to a day, and let the flavors blend. I swear, some sort of fairy magic makes sandwiches taste AMAZING after some time. Make sure to get an extra bag though because the juices like to escape :P
Geesh! Been trying to eat here for over a year.... and here is our adventure:Drove past this place thinking the building was bright blue like the yelp pics indicate only to realize it was located in an unidentified (what seemed to be) abandoned lounge/bar... kinda weird given this is a sandwich joint.Tall lanky good lookin' fella in the front tells us we have two choices- either get on the wait list and wait 30 min just to place an order and then wait another 40 min to actually receive our food OR call in and place an order but either way food wont get in my belly for another hour and 10 min. Since me and the bootards had no where to go we decided to be on the wait list. May i remind all of you this is at 2PM ( who the freak eats sandwiches at 2PM?) Thats right... us suckas! Anywho....played enough angry bird games to want to puke while waiting. Finally around 3PM we got our food! Here's the break down of my emotions:Ripped the parchment wrapping off sandwich like no ones business- took first bite of my menage a trois and changer sandwich- felt ultimate ecstacy in my mouth and down my esophagus- almost fell out of my chair GOOD!- wanted to fall to the ground back first and slowly devour every single bite while rolling myself all over the ground ... it was that good... Here is where my disappointment set in:sandwich was not as big as the yelp pictures i have seen. In fact it was super small ... even smaller than a regular Togo sandwich. I mean i waited in line for the longest time to get a sandwich that didnt fill me up. Also the sandwiches were pretty pricey. I dont think i would go back unless i had a few hours to spare and wanted to indulge in over prices bread with fixings. Good day!
My sister-in-law ventured our way to Ike's bc of the amazing reviews and we were not disappointed! We split the Spiffy Tiffy and it was delish. We would recommend anyone to go here for lunch but take a friend! Their sandwiches are huge! Loved it!
My husband and I made it a priority to visit Ike's Place a few years ago after seeing it on Man v. Food and I can't decide whether that was a great decision or a bad one. The problem is, I live in Orange County and Ike's is about seven hours away from us -- and every once and a while, I find myself craving a delicious, crunchy, creamy, wonderful sandwich. The sandwiches exceeded our expectations by far. The first time, I had a Castro's Pride, but it's no longer on the menu. We made it up there a couple weeks ago (to the new location) and I had the Monte Cristo-ish one (can't remember the name atm). Just as amazing as I remember it. Ike's is a treat for us so when we're in San Francisco and are able to make it, I tend to do crazy things like add jalapeno poppers to pretty much any sandwich I order. It's always been amazing. The Dutch Crunch and dirty sauce are also a must.For those of you who haven't been to the new location, you're in for a treat. Although there's no seating, there is room to wait inside the building and things are a bit less claustrophobic (but not for a lack of charm). It'd be nice to have tables on the sidewalk like some of the near by places, but not sure the city would be willing.Ike's has by far the best sandwiches I've ever eaten and the only thing that would make it better is if they'd open some in Southern California :) If you're thinking about going, DO IT! I'll live vicariously through you...
I walked into Ike's with HIGH expectations, mainly due to the almost perfect score here on Yelp.The cashier and lady promoter were very friendly. She told my gf and me about a $2 discount on our meal if we install an iphone app. My assumption was the wait was going to be an hour, so we called an hour before arriving to place our orders and hopefully avoid the wait. We got there at 12:45pm on a Wednesday and there was NO LINE. The cashier handed my a bag with the sandwiches. I was waiting to get seated, but then realized it's self seating. Once seated, we went to wash our hands, then realized we didn't get the chips, so I had to go to the front of the restaurant to pick up the chips in the boxes on the floor. First bite was good. Not heavenly, best sandwich I have ever had, but good. Got thirsty after second bite. No waiter. Got up again to ask the cashier for a water. 10 minutes later the promoter lady arrives with 2 waters. Third bite of my Napoleon Complex and I came to the realization, the sandwich should be warmer? Perhaps it was due to ordering the sandwich WAY too early on a weekday.After finishing hal of the Napoleon Complex, I tried my gf's Menage-a-Trois. This sandwich is supposed to be the flagship. Personally I thought it was too sweet. Plus, the dirty sauce was already soaked into the sourdough bread. Very average sandwich to me. For a sit-down restaurant, I expected some more service. But I guess it's just a different way of doing business. Cutting labor cost to increase revenue, the American way. Not to mention, the prices average $10-13 per sandwich. This is 2-3times more expensive than your Safeway deli sandwich. Including the $3 tip, my bill ran up to $23 for 2 sandwiches and 2 bags of chips.
There are no words to describe the feeling when you bite into an Ike's sandwich. Suddenly music starts playing in the background. Dutch crunch and dirty sauce - the MUSTs in an Ike's sandwich. Had the Lincecum and Backstabber. Expect to wait but great service.
OBSESSED.There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said, so I'm just going to use this space to brag about how I actually got to sit at a table at Ike's the last time I went!
Ok, my sandwich, a Pizzle with chicken bacon ranch and cheddar, plus grilled mushrooms was real good.A long line too but I got out there pretty quickly. Definitely lived up to the hype and I will be going back.
Hands down best sandwiches in SF. Going Home for Thanksgiving, The Change, and the Menage a Trois are a few of the rotating cast of characters that I order. In addition to calling ahead, use the new Android app to order, and you can choose your pick up time.
I have only had a chance to go there once. I will go back and try another. I had the nacho girl, roast beef with avacado and mushrooms, yummy, need I say more.
BEST SANDWICHESS EVERR!!!All the sandwiches I ate here was so delishhhiiousss! I just wanted to burst in tears of happiness when I had my first bite of the sandwiches. :') Spiffy Tiffy tasted like pesto pasta in a sandwich.. mmm Hollywood's SF Cheesesteak is super yummyyyy with the mushrooms. Menage A Trois is also good, but a bit sweet for my liking.I went here before the rush, so the wait wasn't bad at all. I like how we get complimentary bag of chips and a caramel apple lollipop! OOOO YEEEAAAAAAAA! Plus, service was super duper friendly. Yay Yay! Too bad they don't have one here where I live, but that's good or I'll become a huge chubby bunny from eating here too much!!
I would of totally gave this place a 5 star if they didn't mess up my order. half way through i noticed it wasn't the sandwich i ordered. I ordered the thanksgiving one on dutch crunch, but when i started to eat my sandwich i noticed no cranberry sauce so in reality i have no idea if the sandwich i did order was suppose to be all that great, but i did get a side of cranberry sauce + sriracha sauce like the worker adviced. but when i went back to say my sandwich was not the one i ordered they immediately apologized and offered to make it again. But i said i would be fine with the cranberry sauce on the side. Also a fair warning these sandwiches are on the heavier side. they are a mouthful of flavor! something about the sauce they use is like a sprinkle of crack in my sandwich. its addicting. I killed my sandwich. our group had very mixed opinions mainly the guys loved it more the girls. one of my friends ordered this sandwich that was suppose to have salami but for some reason everyone said it was pepperoni, i mean the pieces were smaller oily and cooked. but they advice her that it was salami. i know they were swamped with customers. but messing up two orders? is why i docked off a star. also tried the eli manning that my friend couldn't finish and that one is freaking AWESOME too. my gf made her own sandwich, a turkey + roast beef on a dutch crunch with everything on it but they forgot the cheese! i will def go back, i just hope round 2 they don't mess it up
Wowowowow .sandwiches are ridiculous. Had a hot mama huda. Omg. Added jalapeos and mozzarella sticks. Omg.
Maybe nobody wants to say this, but - let's be honest. The sandwiches here are overpriced. There. I said it.They are, however, freaking delicious and dirty and totally worth the 20 minute wait. (Hey, they also come with a free bag of chips).Their menu is weird in that they don't include all the sandwiches they actually create (for example, the MILF) - but that's what word of mouth and yelp are for.Great location within reasonable distance of Dolores Park.. perfect to grab to add to your picnic basket!Yummy.
Update: 6-10-2011: I returned to Ike's last night and I want to first talk about the food. I got the Spiffy Tiffy Gluten Free and it was just amazing! The bread was not the typical dry gluten free bread, it was moist and filled to brim the amazing fresh ingredients. The BEST sandwich I have EVER had hands down.I put this review up and to be honest I did not expect anything from Ike BUT... This is not only the best sandwich I have ever eaten but the best customer service experience I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. Thank you Ike for caring so much that you went out of your way to make one customer extremely happy! I cant wait to come get another sandwich... and another and another! I have gone to the Ike's in Redwood and I have had such an excellent experience - I could not wait to get the one in the city! I went last week and when I finally got up to order I was told they were out of Gluten Free bread. Now I do have to say that I am usually pretty easy going when it comes to places that don't advertise but when you say you have gluten free bread I would think that you would want to make sure you have enough to last the day. I was so disappointed and the girl was really sweet about it but until I try it again and they have the bread they advertise they have I am giving Ike's 1 lowly star... Sorry Ike don't worry though I will give you another shot.
I've never had a sandwich here that I didn't like. I usually get the BLT and that's because I love BLTs anywhere I go. But if I had a choice, I'd have a BLT here all the time. However, I decided to go outside of my comfort zone and get a different sandwich. I got the Jaymee's Sandwich (#98?, I think) and boy am I glad I did. Easily the BEST sandwich I've had at Ike's. This is now my new favorite sandwich at Ike's. I can't wait to come back and get another Jaymee's Sandwich (yellow BBQ sauce, fried chicken, and other stuff).
AWESOMEEAT THIS FOOD*hint, call in your order, or download the app, so your sandy is ready for you when you get there.
Honestly, waiting an hour and 20 minutes for a sandwich is pretty ridiculous. I tried the 16th and Market this time, with chicken, avocado, bacon, and jack cheese. It was really tasty, but I would never wait so long! Maybe that's why I never came back... I would've phoned in the order, but my 3 guys friends were trying the place for the 1st time and didn't know what to order. Still pretty pricey for the portions. Also, why is there a list to be put on to order? Why can't you just order when put your name on there? The way they're operating outta Lime just seems really inefficient. Little Lucca in South City still stands as my favorite sandwich joint. Bigger portions for lower prices. And their garlic sauce is to die for.
Not going to budge 5000 but I can't let go how I was asked to leave from the public sidewalk in front. I realize they probably have a problem with litter but it is a public sidewalk and none of their business where I eat my sandwich
Small little place up near Castro in SF. Great selection of sammiches (sic) and loved the friendly service. It's not too often the owner of the establishment is actually doing work inside their own establishment. I got to meet Ike as he handed me my bag of treats and also connected with him via Twitter and he thanked me for coming to his restaurant. The prices are a bit, but you get what you pay for-and make sure you eat after work because you will be worthless afterward. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a city's best kept secret eatery.
pretty much the best sandwich ive ever had. Also awesome names, I think we had a nacho boy and a nacho girl.
I thought to myself, how could a sandwich shop have over 2,800 reviews and have a consistant rating of 4.5 stars? This place must blow your mind away. Finally, the moment of truth came. The only thing that it blew was my precious money. For a sandwich that tasted like any other sandwich shop and paid twice as much, I was pretty upset. You say...did you try the dirty sauce, dutch crunch and menage a trois??? Yes, I tried them all. It's all a hype. It's not bad, but nothing special.
Had their nacho boy on sourdough this past weekend. YUM! The only downside is there is no place to sit so definitely a take out place for sure. Aside from that, I love that you can call and order way a head of time!
Good stuff as everyone says. Went here cuz I read a reviewer that said its free on your bday. I'd like to clarify that you have to be on the email list (that's kinda important to know). Would be nice to have some counter/bar seating for those who eat in, but I understand, space is a premium. The Ike's in Oakland is great too.
Arrived here at 2:08PM on a Friday two weeks ago. Pulled right up and got a miracle space, right out front. Pretty cool, especially in this neighborhood. Spoke to a lot of people in line, made new friends and at 3:11PM, an hour later, I was out of there with my sandwich, fries, and candy.Ordered a Super Mario (all beef meatballs, mozzarella sticks, marinara) and contrary to what everyone says, I ordered it without dirty sauce. Sorry, just not a fan of mayo or mayo-based sauces, especially on a sandwich that is so similar to pizza. When all was said and done, the bill came out to a little over $12 although that included a bag of chips and a piece of candy.Loved their selection and eager to try some of their other items on the menu, but yikes, I don't know when I'll ever have the time or the patience to stand outside for over an hour just to get a sandwich again. Since I have yet to try some of their other sandwiches, I'll be kind and give it a five, but at this point, my gut feeling says four and a half. They have a mind-boggling list of offerings though...pretty amazing.Regardless, Deli Board still remains my all-time favorite.
Amazing sandwiches! Just get there early to get a spot in line.
I tried the 3 way on Dutch crunch, definitely a good choice! Hubby got the hot mama which was also very good. Whenever we're in SF now, I'm going to have to visit Ike's!They're lacking a star from me because there isn't really a place to sit and eat. I like the sandwich when its nice and hot. It's not good cold or reheated. ...And it's a bit pricey for a sandwich and chips.
Delicious.Anyways, I came back here the other day and ordered "Al Bundy" (ham, salami, avocado, french dressing, cheddar) and got my bf "Change" (thinly sliced rib eye, BBQ sauce, beer battered onion rings, cheddar). I also asked for pickles in the sandwiches which is free upon request. You HAVE TO get dutch crunch for the bread! It makes the sandwich 10x more better. The total came out to be about 25$ which is pricey but definitely worth it. It was such a satisfying sandwich because there was so much ham and deliciousness packed inside.On a side note, it is extremely hard to find parking in the area. I had to park on a fire hydrant and try to be as quick as I can. Also, look through the online menu before you go because their menu that is posted in the store is just a small selection. They do not have the full menu except online, so be sure to check out which sandwich you want when you go. Unless you have a smartphone, then you can just see when you get there.
One of the best sandwiches I have had by far! I ordered the Paul Reuben on Dutch Crunch. I would go a little bit before the lunch hour craze as there will be a line out the door. The portions are big , you can share or save half of it for later.The reason why I don't give it 5 starts is not because of the quality of the food but because there is no place to sit although they do have room to put a few tables and chairs.
All of my friends pretty much rave about Ike's and I can see why!Today I got the Papa Sam (wild salmon burger, Ike's dirty sauce, and havarti) and it was delicious! The only hangup I had about the sandwich was that it was expensive ($9.99?! eesh) and I thought it was a liiiittle too greasy. The sandwiches ARE big though (I can only eat half when I go) and you get a free bag of chips!It's also nice that they offer vegetarian/vegan options and any of the meat sandwiches can be made vegetarian. I'm not a vegetarian, but I have a friend who is, and it's great that she doesn't have to be limited to some sparse rabbit food in a roll. The staff is super nice and very efficient in getting the orders out quickly! Sometimes the wait can be 30-45 minutes, but honestly, if you're in good company, just sit down somewhere and chat!Totally random, but I LOVE the music they were playing too! I wasn't sure if it was a special Ike's station or what, but it was awesome :)
Awesome sandwiches! They have a significant line, so order ahead.
Fantastic place. They know what they're doing. I don't know if it's the best sandwich in San Francisco or the best sandwich I've ever had, but it's certainly up there. Customer service is excellent. They run the place very efficiently but with great attitude. They'll ride you a little hard about staying clear of the neighbors' doorways and steps, which actually leads into a good story down below, after the rest of the "real" review. Prices are good. Like $12 for a sandwich (with chips, they're always included) and a good, bottled root beer. They have an almost staggering selection of sandwiches, and they cater to gluten free, vegetarian, vegan, and omnivores. Good variety of meats, vegetables, cheeses, sauces, etc.The quality of the meat was a little lower than I expected, but I didn't notice. The sandwiches are crafted together in such a way that you aren't looking to taste this or that part, but rather each bite of the whole thing. They do a good job of creating whole sandwiches and not just "this awesome thing between two pieces of bread." The only bad thing about this place is the utter and complete lack of seating, but whatev. It's pretty easy to forgive. So, story time. We're standing outside eating our sandwiches, and there's this adorable little white scottish terrier leashed up to a post outside the place. He was there when we got there, and we were there for 20-30 minutes outside the place eating our sandwiches. No big deal, right? The dog was happy, the weather was good, everything was fine. One of the residents of the building next door pulls up to her driveway, and starts staring at the dog. She pulls into her garage, comes out, and stares at the dog. To the point where five or six of us outside the restaurant took notice. She starts asking if we know who the dog belongs to, and we didn't. She goes inside to ask, saying, "that's no place for a dog." We figured she just didn't like seeing the dog neglected, which while maybe a bit of an overreaction, isn't really remarkable.Then she comes back out and declares that the dog is leashed up to HER post on HER side of the property, and she's going to have to take it inside her house until the owner gets back if nobody is going to claim it. She walks up to the dog and starts undoing the leash from around the post, and someone says, "Um... excuse me, that's my dog."The lady began to freak out, telling the guy that he had no right to leash his dog on HER post, and how dare he do that, etc. The guy was like, "Whoa, calm down, it's just a dog and we're standing right here," and she went on and on about it, accusing the guy of being inconsiderate and violating her rights as a homeowner, until the guy excused himself from the conversation and left, informing her that . She proceeded to walk around the restaurant, exclaiming how awful it was that Ike's was there and how her doorstep was always dirty and crowded, and asking if anyone agreed with her. Nobody did and after a while she wandered inside her house, mumbling the entire time. So if the staff rides you a little hard about crowding the doorways or resting your root beer on the neighbors' property, that's why.
If you have never tried Ike's, what are you waiting for? DO IT!Ike's is one of those places you try once and wish you had several stomachs to try every sandwich. You finally choose a sandwich and then after many blissful bites later, you wish you can just have it everyday for lunch (ok, maybe just me?). Too bad I am so far from Ike's. Open more locations please!?But at the same time, I love it that it has now become my staple whenever I am in the city and a MUST to recommend to people. Other sandwich spots have to follow after ya'll. Fresh quality sandwiches, I LOVE!Follow them on twitter or fan them on facebook for giveways too. Menage a Trois is my FAVE! It's hard to try any other!
Delicious sandwiches! I did enjoy it quite a bit and the dirty sauce is quite yummy. I got "the name of the girl you're dating" and my wife got "nacho boy." The sandwiches were yummy. I don't know if it is a place I will drive out to specifically for (I live in the east bay). It didn't quite live up to the hype, but it is quite a delicious sandwich. I'd definitely recommend it if you are in the area.
This place is awesome! The sandwiches are really good and there is a huge selection. Even though the line was kind of long and it gets a little hectic inside while you are waiting for your food, I still feel like Ike's deserves 5 stars. The energy in the line was great and kept me and my friend entertained so the time in line went quickly and once we ordered the sandwiches were done pretty quickly. Also, I lived in New Orleans so I was really excited to see they have Zapps chips!!
Unbelievable! I got a gluten free Pizzle with tomatoe....I never thought it was possible to fall in love with a sandwich it was sooooo good! The sandwich was a wonderful mix of crunch from the bacon, cream from the ranch and softness of the chicken it worked well together. Himself got a Hot Momma Huda and never said a word while eating he was so busy enjoying. It had an almost vinegar tang to it which worked well with the spice while not too spicy. Personally prefer the Pizzle but both were awesome! We had heard it gets busy with queues out the door so we arrived around 10.30am and were served almost immediately. As we left the queue was growing and when we tasted the sandwiches we could see why! Excellent food, great service and a very clean place. Would definitely return!!
This place is so good, people waited outside a tiny shop in long lines at all hours of the day and made the neighborhood hate Ike's and have to move.And move they did! I think now you can only order your sandwich ahead of time and pick up, leave immediately. They have strange hours too since they are located INSIDE another restaurant. Ike's has a million sandwiches, all delicious, but like Kinder's what makes it is the DIRTY SAUCE. It sounds naughty, and it is. It comes with pretty much everything on it (banana peppers included). Don't forget to specify if you don't want something. They serve some sandwiches on Dutch Crunch bread. It's really good, but also really CRUNCHY. It can cut up your mouth if your not careful, but its a little sweet, which I like. Sandwich names are AWESOME, my fav: the Pizzle.
I love me some sandwiches. The great variety alone is desserving of multiple stars...but the cost...omg. shoot me. The sandwiches are solid, but so, so, so expensive. Its a good sandwich shop.
WOW! Just wow! If you want to experience an orgasm in your mouth, this is the place to go! Words can not describe how great this place is!
Ridiculously delicious sandwiches. Huge. I can only eat half of one and I have a big appetite. Call in your order ahead of time and you don't have to wait in the long line.
I heard great things about this place! I was here last Thursday afternoon with Thomas F. yelp.com/user_details?us who was showing me around! We had some trouble finding the place, as he was looking for the old Ike's location and I was looking for a sign to say Ike's @ Lime. Give me a break I havent been here before!So you walk in to the cashier who hands you a menu and lets you order. Apparently when you sit down to wait for your food, you can't order alcohol from the waitresses, you have to head to the bar to order it. They have some crazy teas here, I guess they have a chocolate tea and a blueberry tea! Plus they sell DIRTY chips here!!! +1 High five!!I got the ABLT minus the cheese and mayo! Sooo good! The bread is amazing as well!
As I am typing this review, I am trying to think of what to write that others haven't mentioned yet. My friend and I came here last Friday cuz I wanted to try out this joint after reading all the reviews. Make sure you call in advance to place your order. I placed the call at 10:50am and the sandwiches weren't ready until 11:45am. But if you don't know what you want, you can always go and place an order there. They have a sign outside the door. Might just take longer...Venue - The new place has seats. The tables are short and the seats aren't that comfortable, but it's a good place to have a nice discussion. When we went, the credit card machine was down so it took awhile to pay for our order. They should have two lines, one for pick up and one for ordering cuz it got confusing.Sandwiches - We had the Eli Manning and the Matt Cain. Both were packed with deliciousness. All sandwiches are served hot and withIke's Dirty Sauce unless otherwise specified. Eli Manning (11.11):Halal Chicken Breast, Zesty Garlic and Herb Sauce, Mushrooms, Avocado, Cheddar; Matt Cain (9.99): Roast Beef, Turkey, Salami, God Father Sauce, Provolone. (yelp.com/biz_photos/dold)I liked the Matt Cain a lot better but the sandwiches were so big that I could only finish half. The Dutch Crunch bread was to die for! I suggest going for that bread. The only downside is that the sandwiches are kinda pricey... I would definitely come back though.
After years of taking in all the hype and nibbling on others' sandwiches, I finally made it to Ike's for myself to experience the best sandwich in sf. And I must say, I get it. A friend from high school was visiting for the weekend, and sharing a passion for meaty goodness between two slices of bread, I knew we had to go to Ike's when he suggested sandwiches for lunch. We split the Matt Cain and the Nacho Boy, both on dutch crunch. So the line wasn't that long when we went. The girl at the register was super nice and fun, and though it was a bit of a madhouse inside waiting for sandwiches, the staff obviously has the system down. Opting to enjoy a semi-decent day in the city we took our sandwiches to dolores park, obviously the best place nearby to savor an Ike's. Although my friend is likely a greater connoisseur of fancy sandwich shops in socal, I think i managed to choose a good spot up to his high standards. The ingredients worked well together, the bread was great, and yes, the dirty sauce was thebomb.com. yeah, i went there. So color me obsessed. I foresee using any excuse to stock up on some Ike's whenever I'm in the neighborhood. And though it's a bit of a trek, I plan on convincing my coworkers that we need to start lunching here.
Great sandwiches! Everyone is friendly all the time and the sandwiches are delicious!
its greats
Such good sandwiches! I haven't been since the recent move to Lime, but my goshhhh the Spiffy Tiffy on dutch crutch plagues is my dreams! Though the line was a little ridiculous. I really want to try other sandwiches but the prices are a slight turnoff. $10 for a sandwich?! It's probably because I'm a cheap asian but for ten dollars I can get fuller a lot quicker... But ya know, once in a while, its good to indulge oneself. And believe me, Ike's is the place to do it!
I ncredible taste to their signature "Dirty Sauce"K icks up the flavor to their already tasty sandwiches E very sandwich comes with the dirty sauceS election is wide, too, with Veggie, Vegan and Gluten-free optionsP artook in the gluten-conscious Al Bundy exprienceL iked the salami/ham combo with avocado and cheddar A wesome honey flavors in the Love Triangle veggie sandwichC hips come with the meal -- try the Funky Fusion Dirty ChipsE mpire Cola goes great with your food
Very expensive, I do not think it is worth it.
You might say that I was on a mission when I went to Ike's Place. I live in Seattle, but when I visited Yelp one day from a public computer it defaulted to San Francisco. The listing for Ike's Place was featured on the front page and caught my eye. Reading the reviews, I was intrigued -- nothing gets me like a solid sandwich. When they're good, they're good, but when they're *really* good, they're life-changing.It was then that I knew I had to try this place. I bookmarked it and moved on, thinking, "Someday, someday..."Now, hype and I have a tumultuous relationship. I tend to get over-hyped, and feel let down after an experience doesn't live up to my high expectations. So, when the opportunity arose to go down to San Francisco, I was over the moon that I'd finally be able to go to Ike's Place (albeit cautiously pessimistic that I might be in for another one of my letdowns).However, letdown it was not. Incredible, delicious, near-perfect. Forget your diet; don't bother to count calories. It's worth every bite and more to try one of these sandwiches at least once in your lifetime. If you're me, you'll try one more than once in your lifetime; it was so good that I ended up going two days in a row, which is really quite a big deal for me if I'm on vacation and trying to diversify my food portfolio. San Francisco, I will be back - and when I return, I can guarantee you that I'll be going to Ike's.
They just take wayyyyy too damn long to make a sandwich. There's no logical explanation for why the line is always so long.
I've been to Ike's a total of four times and ordered differently each visit. I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon. Don't get me wrong, the staff are all hecka nice (big points) and the sandwich combos interesting, but the sandwiches themselves are just not good. They all come drowning in some variety of sauce that will either rot your teeth or assault your sodium receptors. I have no idea if the ingredients are fresh or even tasty because everything gets lost in the accompanying gravy. Bummer. And at an average of $9/10 a pop they're no bargain unless you're sharing with a friend who happens to be into the same sauce as you. Sorry to say it but these are essentially way-hyped, very expensive junk food items.
If I'm craving a sammich, I always go to Ike's Place. SO GOOD. for some reason, their chicken just always tastes so good and delicious. their ingredients always taste fresh and they must sprinkle crack or something in that special sauce because it is specciiaallll.... finger lickin' good!
Damn Fine Wiches!Sauce/Service/Selection/Sodas/I ran out of S-catagories... It is all good and damn again, the best/hard to find cherry cola from NC to BOOT. The new location does it right and wow on their bread. Do get a place at the Giant's Ballpark, goldmine #4!
Dutch crunch bread is fantastic. I had the backstabber sandwich, which is marinated chicken, artichokes and provolone. Very good. Fun little place.Tip - check out their website for pictures of every sandwich, secret items and discounts.
The sandwiches are huge. The setting is cool. The prices are affordable. The folks there are super nice. What more can you want?The sandwiches themselves are pretty good, though I think it's a bit overrated. I was expecting a bit more because this place has been hyped up so much to me. It's good....but certainly not amazing. They have a community of loyal followers and I think that really drives up their Yelp rating.
When I saw this place on the TV programme Man Vs Food I promised myself I'd visit if I ever made it to San Francisco and I am so glad I did.I ordered the Kryptonite sandwich (the one featured on the show) and which happens to be the one of the most expensive on the menu at $19.99 plus tax. What a revelation. I had never in my mind ever expected a sandwich to taste this good. The melt in the mouth combination of various sliced meats, avocado, mozzarella sticks, onion rings, salad, bacon, pepperjack cheese and special sauce melded together into a complete taste sensation. And did I mention the size?! OMG it weighed a hefty 2kg my partner and I could only manage to eat one half of the sandwich between us!Thanks Ike you've completely changed my mind about how tasty a sandwich can be. Please come over to the UK and set one up here!
Well, this is silly. This review won't be seen by anyone. Writing a review for a place as EPIC as Ike's is futile. But I ate it today, and I'm just sitting at home sick, so why the heck not?The best sandwich on the (vegetarian) menu is the Love Triangle. Also known as the Menage a Trois for those of you who lurve meat. This is the only sandwich that I have to keep eating until it is finished. It's a problem and an addiction.Other honorable mentions go to Blind Date (aka name of the girl that I'm dating) and the Captain Corey. The Pee Wee (aka paul reuben) was good, but would have been better with fake corn beef and tangy-er (tangier? Isn't that the name of a place?) sauerkraut.
Came here with a friend as part of a summer adventure. The line didn't look too long, but they only have one register for non-VIPs, so it took a while to order. Nothing compared to the wait for the sandwich, though, which took almost half an hour... at least we had chips (that come with the sandwich) to munch on while we waited.I got the Going Home For Thanksgiving - turkey, cranberry sauce, and havarti in their famous dutch crunch and dirty sauce. Oh my god it was gooooood. Since Ike's doesn't have room to sit and eat, we went to nearby Dolores Park and flopped down in the grass for an impromtu picnic. Wonderful because it was a sunny day, but the lack of seats would have been a bummer if the weather wasn't so nice.The sandwich was a dream. Would be five stars if it wasn't so expensive. $10 for a sandwich is kind of a stretch, no matter how delicious.
Literally the best sandwiches on the planet. The long wait is worth it, trust me. I swear if I had to choose a last meal on earth it would be Ike's. Perfect location, take a walk down to Dolores Park with your sandwich and experience pure San Francisco bliss.
If the owner of one of the hottest businesses on Yelp permits, I'm officially on Ike's deli's bandwagon. I had a rare day-off, so I met my wife for an early lunch, before the workers from the area invades this small little deli. This is my debut to Ike's, but wife has been here many times and constantly rave on how yummy the sandwiches are. Wife loves the #75 sandwich, which is the "Barry Zito". The $7.00 sandwich, which is named after the former CY Young winner with the Oakland A's and currently with San Francisco Giants, is a Grilled chicken sandwich with melted Havarti Cheese, avocado, lettuce, onions and tomato on a grilled sliced garlic bread. According to her and witnessing the smile on wife's face, the "Barry Zito" sandwich tasted good enough to strike out any major-leaguer, considering his tenure with the Giants is a huge disappointment. I had one of the other daily specials, which is the "Back-Stabber." I also liked the name of the sandwich and fit me perfectly because I like to criticize other Yelpers behind their backs in my living room. The $7.50 sandwich has shredded Chicken breast with melted Muenster Cheese, bits of artichoke hearts, lettuce and chopped red onions on a grilled sourdough roll. Back-stabbing about the tasty sandwich is not necessary, because I face to face told Ike, the owner, that our sandwich is so damn good. But I'll backstab to my friends in a positive way, that Ike makes some of the finest sandwiches in the city. Wife used her Visa for our lunch at Ike's. I don't come to Castro St. often, but I'll make every effort and come here and try one of his hundred creative and crafty sandwiches.
Typical SF hot spot. Obviously known for it's crazy sandwiches. I thought it was totally worth the wait. My husband and I got a sandwich to share and headed to the park on a nice sunny Saturday. Overall a good experience.
Ike's Place makes my heart flutter!You cannot deny the 3,527,541,130 reviews. My seester and I took a weekend getaway to SF and yelp'd the best places to eat. The reviews brought us to Ike's and it did not disappoint. We ordered the Menage A Trois (my fav!) and the Nacho Girl and everything was so tasty! Cannot wait to come back! I'll continue having dreams of the sandwiches.
This place is everything it's cracked up to be and then some. I got the Name of Girl I'm Dating, and my friend got the steak sandwich with onion rings on it - both were absolutely fabulous. Definitely recommend taking a look at the menu online before you go - there are a million options, and all of them are insanely tempting.Long line, of course, but 100% worth it (and it moves pretty fast). There's also zero seating, so plan to walk to Dolores Park or camp out on a nearby stoop.
my go to place, never met a person that didn't like Ike's, Ike even tweets you back if you follow him!!
Never fails to put a smile on my face. I don't go to the Castro/Noe Valley area very often but every month I have to drop my rent check over there. Which gives me the perfect excuse to head over to Ike's for a sandwich. One word: AMAZING! They have the best sandwiches in the bay area by far. My favorites are Spiffy Tiffy and The Legend of Zelda (not listed on the menu).
Absolutely great sandwiches. Get the dutch crunch bread. They come with chips which is nice to snack on while waiting for your sandwich. Usually there is a small wait but still pretty quick once you order. The avocado does come in a tub though.
I went back again recently, and wanted to mention that they are no longer located in Lime. Wow, ok, third location, gets kind of confusing, hopefully third time is a charm!! They are now in a permanent (I hope) location near Tangerine, that is all their own and not shared, and you don't have to stand outside and wait any longer which is nice!I am a huge fan, but something occurred to me. The meat eater I went with was meh about the place, but us vegetarians loved it. Maybe that's part of the appeal? I'm sure there are plenty of meateaters who are fans like us though. Also, not quite sure I get the complaints about the size, I mean sure $9-10 is alot for a sandwich, but those things are huggge. I feel like a glutton for eating the whole thing at once, but its so good that I just deal with it.
I had heard about this place from Man V. food, but had to experience it for myself to see if it lived up to the hype. The short answer--YES. These sandwiches were amazing. The bread is so fresh, and their hot sandwiches are toasted perfectly. The quality of meats and cheeses Ike's uses ensures a reliably delicious sandwich every time.You may wait a bit for your sammy, but it's definitely worth it. Also, prices are a bit high, but you'll gladly pay more for a sandwich of such great quality. Plus, they give you a caramel apple pop with every sandwich. Who can't appreciate that?
always a favorite.
ARE YOU SUPERMAN?Would I have to consume all 3 sandwiches at once to become Superman? If not, then hot diggity dog! I am one sandwich away from becoming a super hero! Ike's does not need a fancy introduction; just let the sandwiches speak for itself. However, I will mention to all my sandwich lovers, who come to Ike's expecting to indulge on their juicy, ginormous, saucelicious sandwiches right away, to make an order over the phone. I ordered these babies during lunch hours and it was about a 45 minute wait. First time I went, I ordered the Kryptonite; 2 heavy duty sandwiches for $20. This guy is filled with meat, meat, and more meat. My mouth was filled with meat....yeah, I said it. Second time, I ordered the Lex Luthor; 2 for $20. Nothing special about this sandwich. Couldn't taste the mozzarella sticks. One thing I did enjoy was a drawing of some kind of mythical creature on my brown bag.Two things I learned from my experience here at Ike's. 1) You need a lot of napkins unless you like dirty sauce all over you. 2) I don't know if there's a proper way of holding a sandwich but I fail at the art of sandwich eating. A lot of stuff fell out.Overall, Ike's has an endless list of sandwiches to choose from. To all the vegans, vegetarians, and meatatarians, there's something for everyone. I will definitely come back to complete my final stage of training to become... SuperWOMAN.
Best sandwich in the city. Great meat and the BEST veggie options probably in the ENTiRE world. Amaze-balls
What's not to like? Huge, sloppy sandwiches, a convenient walk from Dolores Park.
Contemporary/traditional-ish sandwiches that hit the spot and the pocket just right.
Add mozzarella sticks! Let's face it. Sometimes it's hard to justify a $15 sandwich... but these are worth every penny.
We ordered in so there was no line! If you want to try the food, I would definitely suggest you use the phone before hand! The sandwich I ordered was really good. However, before I came, my friend was like going crazy describing the different sandwiches and how this place is the BEST place ever. As a result, I had such high expectations that I don't think any place can meet. In terms of price - I think it's a bit expensive for a sandwich at first glance but when you think about it, you pay about eight dollars already at Quiznos and with Ikes you get tons of meat! It's well worth your money.
Have you ever felt like you were at a club at a sandwich shop? Well i did here. There was a guy standing outside the door taking names down and trying to make sure a line didn't form out the door! I called my order in so, they just let me in the door. First time i felt like VIP buying a sandwich.I also also recommend while they are using this location to call ahead of time 6 sandwiches took about an hour and a half.Anyways on to the food. So many to choose from. I had no idea where to start. I ended up choosing the backstabber, and when i called in to place my order, the guy suggest i get the ex-roomate (he seemed very knowledgeable about all the sandwiches). The two sandwiches were almost identical except for the added BACON!!!! Nice i know... it was an awesome touch to the sandwich. I tried 5 other sandwiches and were all delicious in there own ways. I definitely think if your in the neighborhood try it out. Ike even told me to expect to see him in LA in the next couple months. That will be something to look forward to.
Awesome sandwiches. Ask for whatever you want and they probably have already thought of it. Kudos for stumping them.
Friend staff. Food quality great and delicious. Price worth the food. Good amount of meat. Would recommend if you want a delicious tasteful sandwich. I order Menage A Trois BBQ, Cheddar, Halal Chicken, Honey Mustard, Pepper Jack, Real Honey, Swiss. Every thing went well with Dutch Bread.
I really cant say I loved this place. Before checking Ike's out I went on yelp to see the reviews. Majority said 5 stars, that the sandwiches were to die for. I immediately hopped in my car and drove across the city for one of these so called "delicious" sandwiches. I ordered the Matt Cain, came with a lollipop and bag of chips. I got an izze as well; something to wash it down with. Total came to about 16$ or so. There was no room inside as it was packed with customers, even a line out the door! I got in my car and decided to eat it there. The sandwich was a smidgen better than average but definitely nothing to rave about. I mean 14$ for just a sandwich and this is all im getting???! WASNT IMPRESSED.the chips and lollipop had better been thrown in.This place comes off as very appealing especially with all the creative names and sauces they come up with but its really not worth the money.
They've moved at last, thank God almighty they've moved at last!Other than two sandwhiches being expensive, they're still one of the best sandwhich shops in SF and their veggie meatballs are so good they literally have to be meat.
2 words: BOMB DIGGITY!!!! I admit...this shop hit the spot than all the sammy's in SF. nuff said!
The best sandwiches!!! No need for explanation is to why...My choice either Nacho boy + red pesto sauce, or The Change + more dirty dauce!TIP: Yes there are lines, but just call or make the order through the iphone app! So much easier, as you can come and pick it up and eat there or just take it to-go. Don't waste your time in line, that is for tourists... just plan your meal! :)
don't get much better than ikes sandwiches. perfect at 10am to cure a hangover,doesnt matter what you order.
Ike's place, everyone has heard of this place, so does it live up to the hype? YESI've been Ike's in all different locations (Ike's old location across the street on 16th, Ike's Lime, Ike's Redwood city, Ike's stanford, and the newest location being here), and no need to really comment on how long the wait will be. only big advice is...DON'T WALK IN AND ORDER A SANDWICH. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, it will save you a 30min-hour wait. Seriously, this place gets packed. ORDER THROUGH THE PHONE! THEY HAVE THE WHOLE MENU ON THEIR SITE. i speak from experience. So location shouldn't matter it's all the same sandwich quality, DELISH. Just go to whatever is closest to you at the time.This location is a big bigger, and may beable to sit in and eat if it's not overflowing with people. Where I really like to eat is at a local park which is 3 or 4 blocks away (Mission Dolores Park) Ill just rate the sandwiches that i can remember eating. honestly, all sammies are good!
Huge selection of subs, and though you may be deceived by a simplistic sandwich, these will make your day!
To say that Ike's is the best sandwich I've ever had is a gross understatement of how incredibly delicious the sandwich was. To say that Ike's is the best sandwich I will ever have in my entire life is probably a bit more accurate, though I still feel like I'm not doing it enough justice. Just to put things in perspective: after picking up our sandwiches, which came with a bag of chips, we sat down in the car, I took a picture of mine, then took my first bite. Details after that moment become hazy and fragmented, because, to the best of my knowledge, I was lost in what I can only describe as sandwich euphoria. I absolutely wolfed down my sandwich, stopping only to utter the occasional guttural sounds of complete and undeniable satisfaction. When I had finished my sandwich, I realized that A) My God, that was the best effing sandwich I have ever had in my life. B) My God, that was the BEST effing sandwich I will EVER have in my life. C) I completely forgot about the chips, and where I was, and who I was with, and what my name was, etc. D) I want another one. NOW. (Allow me to clarify: by no means was I hungry at all, the sandwich itself was rather filling, but it was so DAMN delicious/amazing/divine that I wanted to immediately get in the hour long line and order another one, which I would undoubtedly wolf down as well.) Now that that's done with, let's get down to the particulars. I highly suggest calling your order in, skipping the line altogether. We called in at 1 on a Monday, and the next available pick up time was 2:40, just as a frame of reference as to how busy they are. Ask for extra dirty sauce, and get the dutch crunch bread. (Trust me on both of these). If you live within 30 miles of this place, and haven't been, you need to go. Not now; more like 7 weeks ago. I ordered the Fat Bastard and my friend ordered the Ex-Boyfriend. Both were beyond-belief in terms of taste and quality, but mine was better. I'm thoroughly convinced that every single one of their 300+ sandwiches would be exceptionally delicious. It's times like these Yelp needs to institute 10 stars, so I can give Ike's 13 out of 10. Needless to say, next time I visit Northern California, I WILL be back to Ike's- that is, if it's still around. Evicting Ike's is the pinnacle of injustice in my opinion. FREE IKE'S!!
I really enjoy places that put the extra effort into making something simple into something that is better, and Ike's does that. So far my favorite sandwich is the "Change". They have a variety of options that will make even the pickiest gluten-free organic, sustainable, vegan people happy. Like lots of others said, their dirty sauce and Dutch bread are excellent. In the two times I've been there hasn't been a line, but then again it was around 2pm both times. They don't have the whole menu on the board, or have any menu's at all besides the website, which is my only minor complaint about Ike's. It's not the cheapest place either, but I think its worth the extra cash. Service was very friendly and informative as well.
Visited Ike's place last Friday...and YES the best damn sandwiches I've ever had!! I had a Matt Cain on Dutch Crunch bread...and it was delicious! My boyfriend had The Damon Bruce on French and couldn't quit talking about it. No place really to eat your sandwich there but even better we took them to Bakers Beach and ate there! It was an awesome day! I highly recommend visiting Ike 's Place if visiting San Fran...you won't be disappointed!
Ikes Place makes a good sandwich, I was most impressed with the vegan and veggie options. There is no seating and the person taking our order made sure we knew we could not sit outside on the curb or in front of the neighboring businesses, she was very friendly, it was not a big deal for us. The prices are a bit high but, its not like its a place we would seek out on a regular basis..but, when we are in the city and in the mood for it sure, we will def. be back! Ike is very very friendly and his creativity in his sandwich combinations is superb, props to him and I wish him continued success!!
I love love Ike's BUT today I was very diappointmented...:(I usually order the mnage a trios, because I like the sweet and savory taste and BBQ and cheddar mix, it's a wonderful sensation of flavor inside your mouthToday 12/27/2012 I ordered the usual and received the back stabber sandwich instead, which wasn't bad but it was not something I wanted and I over paid $2 for it too. I was really saddened, how hard is it to double check the order to make sure a customer received what they ordered? I'm not a fan of artichokes, and I had my order custom made without peppers, pickles, onions and this had it all, everything that I DID NOT want, I know there was always an exception but I've also read reviews where people have had their orders not followed properly due to allergies.All I have to say if I don't get my next order right, this review is going down to a two star and I won't be coming back. Tip: double check that your order is rightTip to Ike's place : do your job!!!!!!
OMG Love this place!! But glad I don't have to stand in line for an hour like back in the day to get my fix!
Every sandwich ever created should strive to be like those birthed in Ike's Place. You may underestimate just how incredible tasting food could be between two slices of bread.. but that's why Ike's is here to change your life.Okay, I'm sounding a bit insane or something over a freakin' sandwich, but there's a reason this hole-in-the-wall shop has incredible ratings. First of all, the selection of sandwiches is completely daunting. I absolutely recommend looking up the menu before going because they've got so many kinds that the board ran out of space and they started listing the newest additions on pieces of paper tacked to the wall.For those who have never been here, this place is TINY. I mean, you step in through the door, and the ordering counter is right there. Perhaps about 4 or 5 customers max could fit in this place standing up. There is no seating area aside from about 3 small tables on the sidewalk that seat 2 people each. Don't forget you can choose from different types of bread and all sorts of other customizations. Oh yeah, and the sandwiches have awesome names like "Back Stabber" "Al Bundy" and "Super Mario". Personally I went for the "Not Tonight, I Have a Headache" .. Halal chicken breast, bacon, BBQ, and smoked gouda. If my taste buds had died and gone to heaven, I'm pretty sure heaven would taste something like this.Remember, well crafted food takes time to create, and waiting was about 15+ minutes. Absolutely worth it. I was stuffed after eating only half that I was tempted to finish the other half just because it tasted so darn good. Oh yeah, you get a lollipop with your order. Can't get any better.Eat here.
Best sandwich place I have ever stepped foot in. Their dirty sauce is just dirty good. Mnage  trois is my sandwich. However, one must be warned that this is a rather messy eating experience but really worth it.
I had to throw my review on here before people say "Why is she reviewing Ike's? They have been closed for months..." Hopefully that won't be the case though. I am hoping Ike's has a new, secret SF location all set up and ready to go and will have a grand surprise opening any day now!!!Obviously, I love Ike's sandwiches. On a star scale of sandwich joints, Ike's get 5 stars. It is the only sandwich place I have ever encountered that turns sandwiches into a guilty pleasure which is a category most people usually put cheeseburgers and pizza in. And I mean that as a total compliment!My favorite sandwich has to be the Pizzle, which consists of Chicken, Bacon, Ranch, Cheddar and that oh so yummy dirty sauce! Mmmm, so melty and wet... biting into that thing made me make sounds that would arouse most men. I enjoyed this sandwich two days before Ike's closed. I'm hoping it won't be too long until I can get my mouth on one of these in SF again. It's too bad those sourpuss neighbors of his had to ruin it for everyone else. See you soon Ike! I know you won't let your SF buddies down! We love you!
Took me awhile to find the new place since I was used to the HUGE Ike's place sign... but it moved a street down and to the opposite side...The new place looks a lot roomier than before. But the workers are still slow for in-person orders since they're super busy with phone orders (need to remind myself to do a phone order next time instead of standing there....)My favorite sandwich: Menage-a-Trois on Dutch Crunch with everything.. it just has a perfect concoction of flavors with the chicken and Dirty sauce!!Each sandwich gets a bag of chips, and I usually get the jalapeno flavored bag (SPICY!! So eat at your own risk and don't say I didn't warn you).
This place has amazing sandwiches! They also have a great selection for vegetarians and vegans. I've had the Captain Kirk, Meatless Mike, Blind Date and Tom Brady. They were all really good but my favorite sandwich was the Tom Brady.
I love Ikes! The lines are long and food is about $10 per sandwich. When friends and family visit I take them there.
AMAZING SANDWICHES, great flavors, have got to try the dutch crunch!
I don't get all the hype. The sandwiches are OK, not bad at all but just not great. And they're expensive. I've walked out paying $14 for a sandwich, chips and a drink. Really???Ike's great and very personable. He is the only reason I can see as to why the place is so popular. I'd rather go to Dinasours and spend $4.50 for what I think is a better sandwich. Sorry Ike ...
Expensive for sandwiches (even with chips and a lollipop included).I've been to Ike's twice now - first time 1hr+ wait, second time no wait - and I want to like them. The waitstaff is super friendly and willing to help you find the sandwich you are looking for. But, it's just not a good place for a weird person like me who doesn't like condiments/sauces. My bf isn't a fan either because each sandwich he's had has too much of Ike's Dirty Sauce.Pro - They have yummy fake meats!Cons - Super saucy sandwiches; even the bread has a spread of something baked in; too much $ The Gramps (veg version) - yummy without the dirty sauce or spread on bread. This is what got me to go back - the vegan steak was so good!Brutus (Veg) - no casesar, no dirty sauce, add avacado and there was supposed to be nothing added to the bread, but there was a mistake. It would have been good if it was plain as requested.
Great sandwiches just hate the line and pricing. That and the lack of seating.
Really great sandwiches, incredible bread and delicious ingredients. Basically standing room only dining or take it out on the sidewalk and enjoy the city. Definitely worth the visit.
...She slowly peels away the wrapper, her hands wrapped tightly around his package...Slowly, she opens her mouth to take in the tasty delight but cannot for his package was too big for her mouth...So, she did what a sensible girl would do, break it down and eat it piece by piece...Eating each part one bite at a time...A little meat, a little bread, some veg and maybe some fried goodness here and there...1) It sounds better when it's a she.2) If you are thinking about something else other than a sammich after the last sentence, then you've got issues...Not sure how I ever got away with never writing a review for this place but better late than never, right?Had the urge to splurge...On a sandwich, that is. Knowing full well, that they cost more than a regular sandwich at other spots but where else in the world can you get a sandwich that can feed you for two or more meals? And this is coming from me, a man that is large and loves the food. I can eat and this sandwich kicked my food loving arse!I ordered the Kryptonite, a large mother loving sandwich that is almost 2 feet long. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. DUDE! THAT'S HUGE!!! No, shit, Sherlock. But here's the kicker. It's FREAKING AWESOME!!! Usually, the larger an edible item is, the flavor is not there and it taste horrible. With Ike's, that is totally not true. From the awesomely finger licking good Dirty Sauce, which I always order extra of, to the fresh bread to the meats. I cannot stop thinking about this place. And the Kryptonite...I think it IS my Kryptonite. Even as I type this, the other half is waiting for me to eat it tomorrow for lunch and I am not sure if it will meet it timely death in a timely manner. It might be sacrificed to my stomach as a midnight snack...One can hope...As for next time, I am going for a different Superman menu item, either the Doomsday or Lex Luther. Extra dirty, just like my martinis.I hope they don't get evicted and eventually make it work out with the City. If not, I hope they find a bigger location in the City so we can at least eat in. Leaving the City would be horrible...Tragic, even...
I really like their Menage a Trois. The honey on the Dutch Crunch makes the sandwiches makes all the difference. Didn't like the other sandwiches as much. Good selection of bottled sodas. Expect at least 30 min wait for lunch.
Our company ordered from Ike's this past week, and good god I am glad we did. I don't say this lightly, but that was by far the best sandwich I've ever had. Even something as basic as a turkey, bacon, and swiss sandwich (aka the Barry B.) was phenomenal, and the "dirty sauce" was the icing on the cake.For those who are more adventurous, this has to be one of the most diverse sandwich menus I've ever seen, something for everyone.I look forward to the next time I get to partake from this mecca of sandwich awesomeness.
I'll take Eli Manning!No, i wasn't drafting my fantasy team, i was ordering up one of the best damn sandwiches i've ever had!!! Despite what people think- that i eat sugar all day long, the second fave thing for me to eat is Sandwiches!!! and i'm not talking pretty cucumber sandwiches, but the messy ones ! And Ike's knows how to make them dirrrty. For my SF trip, Patty P and Craig R both pretty much told me i HAVE TO GO TO IKES! I walked from Tartine to here (not as close as i had thot). Worked up a mean appetite from the walk, waited about 20 minutes, and finally sunk my teeth into pure deliciousness! I got the Eli Manning on the Dutch Crunch Bread, bread which is what every sandwich bread should be- they pull the impossible just like Langers manages to do- which is a crunchy exterior but ultra soft interior! The Eli consisted of halal chicken (don't know exactly what halal is but it was delicious), mushrooms, garlic sauce, cheddar and a ridiculous amount of avocado. And then there's the Dirrrty sauce, which is some magical sauce that makes me drop my bags of cupcakes and say F*ckin Aye! (that's for you Gooch).*Sandwiches come with ur choice of chips and we got lollies too! I'm coming back for the Hella Fat Bastard and Elvis Kieth!
This is probably the best sandwich shop in the city! One of my favorite places to go with some of my girlfriends after a long day. Be hungry because the sandwiches are massive!
Ok, so this place has good sandwiches. I can't lie about that. However, their phones weren't working and the over two hour wait kind of ruined it for me.It's definitely a fun place to go (LIME's music is bumping while you wait in line), but my mom was in from out of town and spending 2+ hours in line was kind of a downer for a couple sandwiches. However, the Menage Trois was delicious and the Al Bundy was incredible. Am willing to try again, but only if calling ahead works :)
BEST SANDWICH EVERRRRRRR!!!!every time I come to Ike's, I am never ever disappointed. I used to go to the old hole in the wall Ike's and now I frequent the new one right across the street. I don't care at all that I spend 10-15 on a sandwich its so frieking worth it, especially when it tastes so good. The dirty sauce is delightful. get extra. Get your sandwich on the dutch crunch. Just do it. I have had a variety of their sandwiches. Anything with Halal chicken is yummy. I love the Name of my Girlfriend and the Menage a Trois. Mainly because they both have honey mustard on them. The Menage has honey on it too. Super Mario is excellent. Meatballs, cheese, and cheesesticks? oh yaaaaaaaa!!!I can go on and on about all of them. This is definitely something you wanna try in SF, at least once!
WTH! NO WAY, WHAT A SHAME IT WOULD BE IF IKE'S PLACE CLOSES. This is insane! Now I'm just pissed. We want Ike's to stay. I want my Superman. I want my Eli Manning. Leave the Manage-a-Trois alone! Jealous cause you're not the M.I.L.F.?! Screw with the Nacho Boy and I'll give you one "HELLA" Fat Bastard!FREE IKE, FREE IKE, WE'RE ON STRIKE!
Came here for lunch while visiting the city. It was highly recommended by a friend (and also by yelp). I read the reviews and decided to call in a pick up order to avoid waiting in line/finding parking/standing around looking lost. I'm really glad that we decided to do so; even at 1:30 PM on a Monday there was a line of people out the door. We ordered the Change and the M.I.L.F. I was a little thrown off by the total price, $25 for two sandwiches? Really? I was a little placated by the fact that the sandwiches were quite big and they also came with two bags of "Dirty" chips as well. I really liked my sandwiches. I think I ordered wrong by asking for French bread instead of the Dutch Crunch (?) which I believe has the dirty sauce baked in? However, the sandwiches were very flavorful; I only was able to eat about 2/3 of my sandwich, and K polished off his and the rest of mine.With their huge selection of sandwiches, I'd be interested in coming back again to try something else. However, I don't think I'd make the special trip out towards this part of town (from Union Square) unless I'm also going to stop by Bi-Rite Creamery.
I had to do a double take on their wall when I first came in and noticed there was no menu up there. Apparently, there's a ridiculous amount of sandwiches to choose from. So ridiculous, that it took a 5 page essay format. I digressed a little. Point is, that it's actually fantastic that they have such a wide array of sandies to select from. They cater to herbivores, carnivores and omnivores alike!I like protein slabbed in between my bread rolls, so I bypassed the vegetarian selections and flipped directly to the meat sandwiches. It was so hard to make up my mind on any item and I decided to choose something with an ingredient that popped out at me. WHAM BAM THANK YOU MAM! STRAWBERRY JAM!! The Count of Monte-Chase-O's strawberry jam/preserve stuck out to me and my sweet tooth could not resist. Whenever I finish a salty meal, I get a fixing of sweets afterwards to balance the experience. This sandwich had the perfect two in one combo of salty and sweet. I loved how it was jammed with jam and dripping of jam with every bite. The ham, turkey and swiss complemented the strawberry taste so well. MAMA MIA!! This review is getting my hankering on for another jam filled sandwich!One star knocked off due to lack of seating.
This place has been on my list forever and we finally went when I was over in that neighborhood. I was always deterred by the apparently long wait, so I had my husband call in the order and then I picked it up. There was a long line of people waiting, but calling in advance was the way to go. I walked right up to a separate line where there was only one person finishing up in front of me, then i gave them the name and my credit card, picked the chips and was out of there within 2 mins. I parked illegally, but it was totally doable for the fast pick-up.Onto the sandwiches, highly recommended! My husband sort of messed up my order so I didn't have everything on it I would've gotten otherwise, but it was still good and he loved his. We'll definitely be back.
WOWZAWhat are these juicy, delicious, baller ass sandwiches doing in such a small store attached to some random building ... NOT on Noe or Castro??? HOW DID I NOT GET BEER BATTERED ONION RINGS? I know.... cause the sandwiches were soooo filling. Hollywood's SF CheeseSteak ... YES ... dirty sauce ... HELL YESI don't know what else to say... REALLY FREAKING GOOD SANDWICHES. Kudos to the tootsie pops :) I gobbled you, too.
wide range of choices. crazy combinations. each with their own different flavors.get there early to beat the rush!
Best sandwiches in the city! Call ahead so you don't have to wait in line, use their facebook app to help decide which of the many many sandwiches they offer. SOOOOOO GOOOOOD!
Ike's?Lime? Ike's INSIDE Lime?Sandwiches and champagne?Movin and groovin?Count me in. (BTW, the pastrami and gouda on dutch crunch w/ pesto was kick ass today.)
My friend wouldn't stop raving about this place.  I had to check it out.  For starters, the place is pretty small and the seating is outdoors -- that didn't stop us.  We ordered several sandwiches and I was able to try a pizza-like sandwich (off menu), backstabber and a bbq sandwich.  For ~$8, I thought the sandwiches were pretty good (I've had better but not for $8).  If this place was nearby to work or where I lived, i'd definitely make it on my short list. BTW, the owner came out to chat with us. Very cool and very classy on the lollipops.Famous for: Tasty sandwiches with unique names
i love this place, enough said!
Frankly, I am a bit over Ike and his manipulation of the media and the public with his restaurant.We all know the drama he went through at his very popular former spot just across the street. It was a unique spot where you stood on the sidewalk forever to order a tasty sandwich.I went a few times and liked it a lot. But then Ike went into "going out of business" mode and fooled the public into ordering thousands of last-minute sandwiches like this was the end of some Golden Era. Once he pocketed our money he just opened on Market at Lime. I skipped that venture, just annoyed at this tactic.But he did open a new place on 16th with an admirable attempt to appease his NIMBY neighbors.So when Blackboard Eats offered 30% off I went. Things had changed and mostly not for the better.If you are going to open a small restaurant you might have a better plan for seating or decoration. It was lacking. The menu has been downsized to Xeroxed, dog-eared, faded copies with Sharpies crossing out prices and raising them. There are two lines, one for take-out orders and one for eating in which was unclear. There was almost no communication between the staff and customers which was confusing. And exactly who are the staff members? It seemed liked random people from Dolores Park just walked in and hopped on the cash register.Our sandwiches were ok, not bad but I didn't impress my girlfriend who had never been there. I am not sure if we really got the discount as we got no receipt and the kid behind the counter was utterly baffled as to how to authorize our code. You were warned....
Fantastic sandwiches, served with chips and great sodas. Pick your favorite SF Giant or otherwise creatively named sandwich and go to town. Sandwiches can serve two, but the reality is they are so tasty, you should just go to town and down the whole thing.
Ugly Owl extra jalepeos please. It might take forever if you don't call 30 minutes ahead, but either way its always worth it.
I LOVE Ike's Sandwiches! Menage a trois + Name of the Girl I'm Dating are scrumptious! The dutch crunch is the best bread, the wheat roll is good too.HOWEVER, the customer service is sucky. There seems to be poor communication between the cashier and the kitchen area. When I recently went there, it took over 30 minutes for me to get my sandwich!! And they only brought it out to me because I asked about it. This is not a result of busy-ness because it was slow when I was there. And my sandwich was barely warm when I got it. I'm pretty sure they forgot to bring it out to me, because I looked at other customers and they received theirs within 10 minutes! I was going to tell the cashier about this before I left, but he looked busy + the line was out the door. The sandwiches here are truly delicious, but they need to improve their efficiency. Whenever I have cravings for this place, I end up dreading the long wait and it deters me to go elsewhere....
Ok, so after reading all the reviews I had to go check out this place to see if it lived up to the hype..... First, the place was a little hard to find considering I was looking for a sandwich shop and should have been looking for a restaurant/ lounge Im guessing Lime is?? =/ Anyway, walked in sort of unsure if this is the place no sign outside. Three men are behind a small desk talking, I smile wait a few seconds they continue talking so I get a little irritated and ask Hi, is this Ike's? The guy say yes, I ask for a menu and proceed to sit down to look it over. I decide on the Jim Rome Turkey, cheddar cheese, red pesto sauce, avocado & lettuce on dutch. The red pesto sauce kind of disappointed me, no real favor, everything else were things I get on my sandwich anywhere so their wasn't much to be impressed with. .....  So it wasn't bad, but it wasn't 5* worthy in my honest opinion, I mean come on this place has close to 3,000 reviews!!! You'd expect firecracker taste, love at first taste type sandwich. But with me I didnt get that, I got a pretty expensive that was OK sandwich, I guess once again, Ive allowed yelpers reviews to make my expectations too damn high. In closing, would I try it once if I were you reading this? Yes. But don't make your expectations so got damn high.. after all its just a freaking sandwich....
Great gluten free turkey/cran sandwich
Ike's you are a Yelp phenomenon that's why I had to try you...First of all it's just an f'n sandwich so get over it people. Paint dries quicker than the time it takes them to make a sandwich. I mean if the staff were to actually move it than the line wouldn't be so bad. I can't believe I had the audacity to wait 20 minutes for a sandwich when it was myself and one other person in the place. I have heard that that is a mediocre wait time...I mean people please.Okay onto price...I thought Burley's on the Embarcadero was expensive but I guess I was wrong. How can I pay $12 for a sandwich? With the jack they are raking in I don't think the legal fees will be a problem if they fight this case.If you want a quality, mouth-watering sandwich go to the Deli Board...they will deliver it to you on a bike it will cost you an arm but not an arm and a leg. Plus it's top-notch ingredients. Their review will be coming soon.
Yummy sandwiches, but much heavier than the typical deli sandwich if you're a health freak because of the secret sauce - delicious, but probably mayo-based.
Literally the best sandwich I've eaten in my whole life! Recommend The Change and Jaymee Sirwich!!
Yesssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so excited to see the big announcement about Ike's opening @ Lime today. Phone orders only, but what's wrong with that? I was pretty bummed I missed the closing of the SF location. Almost depressed actually. So what did I end up doing for lunch today? That's right......called, order placed for my much missed Paul Ruebens & a Lex Luthor for the hubz ( 1/3 Pound Niman Ranch Beef Burger, Chicken Fried Steak, Rib Eye Steak, Mozzarella Sticks, American) MAN thats a dog gone huge delish sandwich. Best believe all the fixins & dirty sauce are joining in on the party too. Thank you Ike's for finding a way for SF to once again enjoy your heavenly sandwiches. Also a big thanks to Lime! My heart, my palate & most of all my stomach thank you.
always satisfies
Went out of my way to try Ike's sandwich. Another check mark off the 7x7 list. I enjoyed it...but I think I got hyped too much. Try it yourself. So many options.
This is how a sandwich should be. Just like Alton Brown on the Good Eats episode about sandwiches, you need to have the right ratio of bread and stuff. Ike has that golden ratio. I asked for no mayo, but I bet honey mustard sauce in The Girl I am Dating had some. No matter. It was just plain good.Ike was friendly.The bite I had of Vegan Meatless Mike was insanely good. Tasted just like the unhealthy version of the Subway Meatball Sub.Although sandwiches cost 30% more than Subway, this place offers value through great taste.Rumor this place is notorious for having lines. No lines @ 6pm on a Saturday.
Ike's Place hits the spot, no matter what. 5 stars for the food and customer serviceI love sandwiches, and Ike's Place has become one of my favorite sandwich places after eating it twice. I went to Ike's on a Saturday around noon to 1pm? The line was out of the door, and almost around the corner, but my friends and I didn't mind waiting in line. In line, there was an employee who was asking us to answer movie trivia questions, and if we got it right, we would get a caramel apple lollipop! I really enjoyed that, because it made waiting in line seem a lot faster, and also, it's just a nice little gimmick for them to do. :) I ordered the Matt Cain, which has roast beef, salami, turkey, provolone, godfather sauce, lettuce and tomatoes in it, on sourdough bread. We get a bag of chips and a caramel apple lollipop for free! Altogether, the sandwich was about $10-$11, with tax. Expensive for a sandwich, but I definitely believe that it's worth the price. No one can recreate such an amazing sandwich, even if they tried really, really hard. It really is like heaven in your mouth. I ate half of it for lunch and the other half for dinner. My only complaint is that they don't have tables or anything in the place, so you have to find somewhere to eat it. We walked to our car to eat the sandwich. It wasn't as fresh as eating it RIGHT when we got it, but it was still good. Really good. The wait for the sandwich was about 30 to 40 minutes, but it was pretty crowded, so that was understandable. But still five stars!
The first time I went to Ike's Place was this past April. My friends and I had decided to take a trip up to SF and someone had suggested this place. Thank goodness!! Good: This is sandwich HEAVEN. The food is AMAZING. I was able to try the "Get Over It" and "Eli Manning". Both were delicious in their own ways. The ingredients were fresh and warm while the bread was toasted just to perfection. You MUST try this place. Any sandwich that I've had after this does not compare. It's also located next to this beautiful park where you can enjoy your sandwich on the green grass and under the blue sky. Everyone picnics there so it's pretty festive during the day.Bad: The wait is pretty long but if you pre-order on the phone, you can pick it up in an hour or so without wait. I will come back every time I go back to SF. I left my sandwich heart at Ike's Place!!!
After seeing this place featured on Man v. Food, I had to check it out for myself. I tried the Going Home for Thanksgiving sandwich, which has turkey, cranberry sauce, sriracha, and havarti. I thought it was very good, and the dirty sauce really helped bring another dimension of flavor to that sandwich. I hope to visit again in the future!
Ike's sandwiches are fit for every occasion. Ike's sandwiches are great while drunk, in the rain, and even if you're just in the neighborhood to pick up some yarn. There are very few places that I will wait in line in the pouring rain. Ike's is one of them. The new location seems to be pretty sweet; even though it's bigger, that doesn't mean it doesn't get cramped when it's crowded. I like their selection of sodas, despite their tendency to be a bit pricey and the Funky Fusion flavor potato chips are crazy delicious. I've tried the [Name of the Girl I'm Dating] and the Menage a Trois (be warned the staff their shorten the name of it to '3 way' and they'll yell that out when they call your name. Kinky) and have no complaints. I feel like the sandwiches at the new location are a tad different than the ones I used to have at their original Castro location, but I need to eat a few more sandwiches just to make sure that the past few lackluster sandwiches I got were flukes due to it being off hours or something. But the dirty sauce takes all their sandwiches to the next level and I never get a sandwich without it.
Delicious sandwiches, smooth operations. Highly recommend calling orders in ahead -- can later pick up and check out upon arrival in a separate line.
Greasy. Slow. Long lines. Expensive ($10 sandwich...) Why do people waits so long for these greasy sandwiches? No idea.I like to yell "sandwiches!!!" at the people waiting in line like cattle when I drive by. You should too.
Intense sandwiches. One time Ike gave me tickets to a hockey game. What a nice fellow.
Overrated! My coworker was in the area and called me to ask if I wanted one of their sandwiches. Sure! I'd read good things on Yelp about this place. I went online, checked out their menu and texted my order. I was excited to finally get to try one of those raved about sandwiches. It arrived and I quickly unwrapped it. Took a few bites and was like, sad. Maybe I got the wrong thing or my coworker did something to it on the way over? I've had better.
Does it make sense to give 5-stars to a place that makes me wait an hour and a half for a sandwich?Should I be afraid to eat something called a "Paul Reubens?"How is it possible that they bake the sandwich bread individually, AFTER each order is received?How awesome is it that all my vegan friends can enjoy equally delicious sandwiches, too?Should I mind having no alternative but to sit on a hard sidewalk, in the San Francisco sunshine, watching urbanites go by as I gulp down my food?What is Dirty Sauce and why do I crave it?Who comes up with these names?Is it bad that I licked the sandwich wrapper clean?Should I be worried that my food is being made in a shop that's slightly larger than a phone booth?You guys remember phone booths, right?Have you ever taken a bite of a sandwich and fell in love with it so quickly that you, almost involuntarily, try to take another bite before you've swallowed the first bite?Do I still have marinara on my face?
Freakin delicious. It took me awhile to get to Ike's, since I'm not really in the castro area much and I don't look forward to waiting in line for my food. The first time I went, I ordered an unoriginal, which was perfect for me. Many of the sandwiches on the menu just had too much going on and I had no idea what I should try first. My unoriginal was roast beef with provolone on dutch crunch, add green pesto, tomatoes, lettuce and onion. It was SOOOOO good. Probably one of the best roast beef sandwiches I had. The beef was a pretty good quality (tastes like it just came off a homemade roast) and the dutch crunch bread was one of the best breads I've had. My brother got some sort of bbq beef sandwich and my sister had the menage a trois. They were both good, but I liked my simple sandwich the best. I just took my husband here yesterday and he loved it too. We got the unoriginal roast beef and the menage a trois with bacon. The menage a trois is a must with bacon!! The salty bacon flavor helped to balance out the honey sweet chicken. Luckily, we beat the lines both times I've been here. I found that you could call in your sandwich to this location, so if you don't want to wait around, you can call it in!
One of the best sandwiches I've ever had! Not sure if this was due to every sandwich being freshly made once you order it or if it was because we waited so long that I was starving by the time we got our sandwiches. Yes, I docked a star because of the long wait.Ike's has such hype (thanks to Man vs Food) that there was a line out the door at 1:30pm (well after the usual lunch hour rush on a weekday). Luckily they let you grab chips first so you have something to munch on while you wait for your sandwiches. The people are nice and the place is clean. I got the "Do you smell what Barrack is cooking?" sandwich (sliced rib-eye, provolone and bbq sauce) with all toppings (lettuce, tomato, pickles, dirty sauce, etc.) and it was one of the most delicious sandwiches I've ever had. I also got the Jalapeno Heat flavored Dirty Chips that were very tasty and just a bit spicy when you start eating a lot of them on an empty stomach. My friends got the Funky Fusion and Sea Salt flavored chips that were pretty good as well. The Funky Fusion chips were very flavorful. The chips are thick and crispy and well flavored.I would definitely go back to Ike's to try some other sandwiches that looked pretty darn tasty but I'll be prepared for the hour long wait the next time around.
When i was at Norcal, my friend wanted to come here because they were famous, so my expectation was pretty high because he told me it is the best sandwich in the US well it didn't reach my expectation. Anyways moving on, the sandwich isn't that great maybe I order the wrong one but I got the #111, I think it was call the Menage a Trois. Sorry but it was just too sweet for me, or too much Honey but it was still good. But I have to say my friend sandwich were much better I think they were call "Just Friends" and "Change/Chain" not too sure haha. but yes if I come back to SF, i will for sure get something different. *fingers cross for a opening in socal in the sgv area"
BEST SANDWICHES EVER.mmm i love going home for thanksgiving!! (;dutch crunch!
Okay on our last visit to SF we were walking down the street from a Sushi bar we had just had a shitty lunch at and saw a line out the door at Ike's. We told ourselves tha tnext time we are in town we have to check this place out. So the Sunday before we left we were on our way to Liguria for Foccacia bread but they were closed. Man that sucked, okay back to Ike's, Our intentions were to get Ike's to so we did and went back to Alice's place to eat em before heading home. Anyways we ordered 7 sandwiches and man I got to try a little of everything. My particular sandwich Hollywood's San Francisco Cheesesteak wasn't the best but if you ever want a good Cheese Steak head down to hermosa Beach in Southern Cali and go to Big Mike's Philly Steak and subsOkay sorry, back to Ike's, The Phil'em Up's KC BBQ was good and that was Roast beef baby!Say Hey was another good sandwichThe Jeris was another good sandwich  My Ex Boy friend was also a good sandwichThe Three Way was another good sandwich and it was chicken boobs and honey and honey mustard on a Dutch Crunch damn and two more sandwiches I don't see on the menu and forgot what the hell they were. Anyways I recommend this place. This is an order and eat elsewhere kinda place. the only time you go into this shop is to pay for your drinks and sandwiches otherwise you stand outside with the birds until it's your turn to order.
They're no longer at Lime! Cool? Yeah. Slow? Probably. Anyways, they're basically across the street from the original Ike's.This building is a lot more spacious. You can actually form two lines without getting confused (I think). There are a few seats along the window, but no tables as expected. I walked in around 2:30pm and got my sandwich within 15 minutes tops. I couldn't call in because I never got through. In a way, I think calling in was only a few minutes faster (on a Thursday) so it is okay. I originally wanted a Barry B, but I changed my mind last minute when I saw Nacho Boy on the menu. You might judge me but I have to take a star away because my sandwich was falling apart after the first two bites. I hate putting my sandwich back together because it gets so messy! *ding!My friend thinks Ike should mount a flat screen so we could watch the game as we wait/enjoy (for) our sandwiches.
After walking up and down the street trying to find this place,we happily stumbled upon a girl standing outside of Lime with an Ike's shirt saying they were temporarily conducting business out of Lime because of some hoopla with their neighbors. We ordered our sandwiches and sat down in the back of the bar that they had allocated for Ike's customers. Kind of a wierd ambiance for sandwiches considering I've been to Lime before and it's more for the nightlife experience. But whatevs. I wanted to see what the sandwich hype was all about.I ordered a Pastrami/Corn Beef Combo on Dutch Crunch with everything on it.1) First impression - Bigggg sandwich!! If you aren't starving like an anorexic cheetah, you can defintely share with a friend!2) The meat was plentiful and tasty!3) Their dirty sauce whatever's in it is what gives their sandwiches a unique flavor!!Bottom line: One of the best sandwiches I've had! They have such an extensive menu so will definitely be back to sample their other sandwiches! Little Lucca's in SSF is a close 2nd!
Lived across the street.Love it. Miss it.I will wait in that line any day!! That is one of the many places I must have when I'm there. Enjoy everyone!
When San Franciscans see a line, well they think they better go stand in it. Why, isn't it so hip to be a part of the Ike's cult following?Aside from the enjoyable sandwich, I have a few pet peeves:1. There's nowhere to sit or stand to immediately enjoy your massive, hot sandwich, thus by the time you get somewhere to eat it, it becomes a wet mess2. Ike's doesn't give you any moisty naps to clean yourself up after the saucy mess you make while scarfing it down3. I paid $16 something for a sandwich, chips, and drink - that's pretty steep (and they don't give receipts so not sure if they charged me correctly)4. The wait sucksBut oh my, no matter my qualms, I will be back for more. That [name of a girl I'm dating] sandwich was delicious because it was like honey mustard chicken salad. Mmmmm. The Change sandwich I had during my first visit was expensive and difficult to eat and probably should be photographed on "This is why you're fat." *Sigh* Yes, I will be here again and again to try all the sandwiches even though I love to pick out the imperfections. But don't you appreciate that I'm realistic?
Hands down one of the greatest sandwiches I've ever had in my life. I forget the name of the specialty sandwich I got, but it came with Halal Chicken, provolone and ranch dressing and tasted AH-MAY-ZEENG. The sandwiches also come with a bag of chips and a Caramel Apple lollipop which I thought was an awesome touch!Great, fresh, independent food with delightful service. The food is worth the trip here!
My cousin and I wanted to do something spontaneous! I picked Ike's Place because I recalled the super, freaking delicious reviews on Yelp! I mean I have to try this place out before they close, right? So we drove here and my god, there was a long line. We came here around 12:30pm and waited for the longest time in the world. I mean seriously, we never waited this long for food, well on the bright side, we get to have some bonding time! We waited about more than an hour just for someone to take our order. Then we get to stroll inside and pick a bag of chips! We waited outside for my name to be called, which took another hour.When I heard my holy name being called, I jumped right out of the car and said "HERE! I'M RIGHT HERE!" No way do I want someone to take my 2 hour long-waited sammies!My cousin and I parked somewhere and unwrapped our sammies as if we were kids opening xmas gifts. I ordered the Nacho Boy (hot roast beef, mushroom, avocado, swiss, and everything on it with dutch bread). OMGOSH! It was like heaven with their "dirty secret sauce". nom nom nom nom x1000, so freaking good. How can a sammie possibly be that good? Well it should be good since I waited another hour for it to be made!It sucks that they are going to close down :( but I will be visiting their other location! Chyeahhh! Burlingame, please be open soon :)
After Bay 2 Breakers 2011, we were trotting back to the Mission, trying to figure out what to eat while watching the Sharks. And Ike's Place revealed itself. I got the D Bruce named after my homie on the 1050 KNBR, Damon Bruce. And let me tell you what...I don't think there was anything else I would have wanted to eat after a long day of B2B. Rib eye, steak sauce, provolone and onion rings. It was perfect. Beyond perfect. The pinnacle of human food creation. A day later, I'l still overwhelmed with sandwich emotion.Every year of B2B, I will quest to get one of these sammies afterwards.
I'd give just a 4.5 if they had half stars. It's not a sit Down joint, since all they have are a few chairs to enjoy the sandwich on your lap! But besides that, the sandwiches deserve the good reviews they've been getting! Dirty sauce is wicked good. Tried the Reuben...awesome sandwich. Can't go wrong, despite me asking for all the toppings. Next time, will try the sf cheesesteak, which also looks great!
Best pastrami sandwich I've ever had!
It breaks my heart to rate this place so low. especially given that I was SO excited to try this place after reading all the rave reviews. But I had a truly sub par experience and so my review has to reflect that. I went with two friends for dinner. We waited in line. For a good 8 minutes, I was the first person in line, and the guy was just standing at the cash register counting cash when he could have been taking my order. Then he finally noticed me and my crew, and asked what I would be having.. at which point I replied that I would like to see a menu... as I had not been handed one. I picked the strawberry girl, no mayo. It was all downhill from here. NOWHERE ON THE MENU DOES IT SAY THAT THERE ARE MUSHROOMS IN THE STRAWBERRY GIRL, YET THERE WERE A PLETHORA OF MUSHROOMS IN MY SANDWICH WHEN I GOT IT (~20 minutes later mind you). ALSO, THEY WERE OUT OF DUTCH CRUNCH BREAD.. This was a huge disappointment as I had heard much about that bread. ALSO, the menu advertised 7.97 for my sandwich. I whipped out a $10 bill (left my Credit card in my car b.c I knew before hand from the website what sandwich I was going to get + the price). The guy then escorted me inside to pick up a "free" bag of chips and drink. That was really cool. I cant deny, I loved the soda selection. WHEN IT CAME TIME TO PAY, HE ASKED FOR $10.94. UM? I said, why the difference, my sandwich was only $7.97. He said they raised their prices because it now comes with free chips. NEWSFLASH, if you raise your prices to include chips, theyre not really "FREE" are they?? I didnt even want / eat the chips yet I was forced to get them ( I asked if it would be less if I didn't get the chips in an effort to be able to fully afford my food with out being $.94 short and without having to go to my car to get my credit card) I ended up borrowing the $ from a friend. Taste wise, I was really really underwhelmed. i LOVE garlic. so I was really excited by this dirty sauce. It really just tasted like the butter spread Colombo uses on their garlic bread.. Which is just really buttery, not really that garlicky. So that was kind of a disappointment as well. (as was having to pick out each of the unexpected mushrooms) The other sauce that was in the sandwich tasted identical to Togo's salad dressing on their asian chicken salad. For a restaurant that says they use unique sauces that distinguish it from what you can make at home, I beg to differ. Firstly I could easily whip this up by snagging some colombo garlic bread from Safeway, and grabbing the asian dressing from togos, slapping on some veggies. For what its worth, I would have much preferred my own concoctions of sandwiches at home, and saved myself $11. I apologize that this review is so poor, I know this place has a cult following, but I had a really crappy experience thats going to definitely affect my desire to give this place a second chance. As you may be able to tell, I left unsatisfied and unhappy.
My friend recommended this place... nice people working there. I took the recommendation of the dude working there and got the "menage a trois" on crunch bread. Great sammy with some wicked garlic flavor.The 45 minute line at 2:00 on a Thursday is always a good sign.
Ah Ike's, San Francisco's flagship sandwich shop. Showcased on many a TV show, what more is there to say about this place? They provide consistently good sandwiches, some of which sound like they were the brainchild of a high college student and the epicmealtime beard guy. It is definitely worth a visit but be prepared to fight through crowds and expect a wait. My only tip is to call ahead for your sandwiches and show up on time for maximum freshness. Many people like to get their sandwiches and head to Dolores Park for a makeshift picnic. Highly recommended. Slightly overpriced, but it is to be expected with the amount of meat they pile on those things. Well worth the price in my opinion.
I've gone to Ike's a few times & endured the wait each time to get one of their absolutely delicious sandwiches. It is definitely worth the wait. However, sometimes it does get cold or tiring since you do have to wait outside on the sidewalk. I think thats probably my only reservation about the place. The actual shop is really only for the workers to make their sandwiches & to house the chips & drinks. Even the cashier stands & waits outside among the eager customers.Each time I've visited, I've had the Manage-a-Trois. It has Halal Chicken Breast, Real Honey, Honey Mustard, BBQ, PepperJack, Swiss, Smoked Gouda. Its one of the sweeter sandwiches courtesy of the honey mustard & bbq sauce. I've tried other sandwiches thanks to bites from friend's sandwiches but i like to stick to this one. The menu has literally over 100 set choices & to be honest, I think its a bit to daunting & much to have all of them. But I guess its nice to have a myriad of choices for those who do like to change it up each time they go.
In theory, a review should be the average of all of one's visits to this place. Therefore, (4.5+4.5+2)/3=3.67, which rounds up to 4.But I'm mad. I called ahead two hours in advance, and they weren't ready when I came, making me wait in the other line for people who called in their orders (what?) If you're going to tell someone to wait two hours for a sandwich, it better be ready in two hours.I had fasted all day in anticipation of ordering the Kryptonite, an incredibly epic sandwich with everything possible imaginable. It came out to nearly $22 after tax, but I figured it was basically like eating 3 meals, and I was excited.What I got was mostly pastrami and lettuce with very little other flavoring. There were very small slivers of roast beef, bacon, avocado, pesto, cheese, and turkey throughout, and I didn't taste any mozzarella sticks or onion rings or anything. I understnad if a sandwich shop wants to hold back with the toppings for an $8 sandwich and not throw a ton of expensive toppings on, but for $22, it better be going all out.If I want to pay a ton of money for a ton of pastrami, I'd rather go to Katz' Deli in New York, where they at least make their own pastrami.And to those who question the ability of a sandwich shop to maintain its quality once they start makign enormous, obscene sandwiches, one should look no further than Manny Hattan's in Austin, which manages to pile on 3 pounds of meat, two pounds of cheese, and a whole loaf of bread in a sandwich.But come on, Ike. I know you can make good sandwiches, because you have in the past. But giving me a sandwich I could have made at home and done a much better job is just lazy.
Had the Doomsday again which still remains one of the best sandwiches that I have ever had. Tony Soprano was alright. Would go with something else next time.
FANTASTIC!!! Huge, tasty sandwiches at a great price! It doesn't get any better than this!
Good sandwiches but way too crowded and slightly over-rated.
Best sandwich in SF and awesome prices. Super friendly staff and right near mission Dolores park
Long wait, but great sandwiches! Be prepared to order you lunchtime selections around 9am!!
HUGE, HUGE sandwiches. I got lucky and came here on a day when the line wasn't long, but I had to keep letting people skip ahead because I couldn't decide what to get. The names of the sandwiches make me chuckle! You have to make a good, calculated decision when reviewing a menu that offers a Hella Fat Bastard, Al Bundy, & Do You Know What Barack Is Cooking? :)Between three of us, we got the King Koopa (tons of fried food: jalapeno poppers, mozzarella sticks, meatballs, no Bowser), something w/buffalo chicken, and a Nacho Boy. These sandwiches are HUGE and all of them come with a bag of chips and a caramel apple lollipop. Mozzarella sticks can be added to any one of them! And it is true, the dirty secret sauce brings it all together. The service here was great, everyone on the team including Ike was nice to each of us in line and walked our sandwiches out to us.San Francisco is lucky to have a local business like this and I'm proud to support it!
Stupid neighbors.I'm furious. This is by far the BEST sandwich shop in SF, and I'm pretty sure I'd kick a baby penguin for one of their sandwiches (and that means a lot considering I love penguins). The pastrami one was the best...grrr, where will I go for my pastrami sandwich cravings now?!Seriously, where the hell did ike go? I wanna follow him...
one word will describe the experiencebaddasssandosforpeoplewholiketoeat
Yummerzzz!! OK so seriously the sandwiches at Ike's are the best! My 2 fav's: Manajatwa - They use real honey :) MILF - omg, freaking yummy. jalapeno poppers in my sandwich- um yum! Best thing, it's Halal - well the chicken is :)
One of the best, if not the best sandwiches I've ever had. I make a point to go here every time I'm in San Francisco. Last time I got the Menage a Trois and it was delectable. You do pay a little more than you would at other sandwich shops but nobody comes close to the quality of these sandwiches.
The sandwich I had from Ike's was amazing. The customer service I received was not. I get the whole, "We're a hip place in San Fran so we can do whatever and continue to have customers lining up down the block" thing. Because clearly that is what's going on here. I confess, being a tourist to SF I was lured in by the hundreds of 5-star reviews on Yelp, but come on, make the effort to no talk to me like I am a bumbling idiot. That being said, I had a delicious 16th and Market sandwich, the dirty sauce IS amazing, but for over $25 for two sandwiches and drinks, I think I might try something a little less pricey next time.
Ah yeah! A sammie called the M.I.L.F. How can you not order something like....or the Menage a Trois or Your Ex-Girl Friend. Hilarious. And all of it with dirty sauce and a bag of chips! Not to mention the crazy brunch scene going on at Lime while you wait for your sandwiches to be ready. The wife and I were having so much fun watching the drunk fools grind with each other, we had to stay and snack on the sandwiches. It was like we were at a convention of drunk people brunching and we had front row seats. Awesome experience. Loved the sandwiches too!
Ike's is all the hype right now and I understand why, the sandwiches are great! I get Mayoose's CA BLT with havarti and it is definitely worth the price considering how big the sandwich is, plus it comes with a bag of chips and a lollipop, which I thought was cute. The workers were really friendly and the place is located in a quieter area, the only negative thing is that it gets really busy during lunchtime. Other than that I would definitely suggest this place if you're looking for a good sandwich shop.
Was here, Peer pressure. Curiosity. Guy on TV who eats everything as long as its huge and dripping with cheese and sauce. SF weekly or guardian with an article about this place closing due to insane popularity....yah, I said "Damn I gotta go there" and I did. Umm...I got the Cheese steak. Was getting ready for some badass hot meat and melted cheese experience, but What I got was more like a Roast Beef sandwich...not hot....correct me if that is how it is meant to be.I will surely come back and try some more items on the menu before professing my commitment to Ike. After our first date, Ike's and I are still in open relationship...*don't kill me guys*
There are a lot of great things about this place:Excellent Staff-Incredibly friendly and over the top considerateExtremely good sandwiches- best in the city, HUGE portion and comes with your choice of Dirty chipsExtensive menu-whether you're a meat eater or vegetarian/vegan, there are tons of choices for you! (It's almost difficult to choose) It was my first time and we ordered:Super Mario- Every bite was down right flavorful and savorySpiffy Tiffy- It was ok because the chicken was a tad dry for my taste but overall still good. I wish I ordered the Manage A Trois, there are tons of good reviews about that sandwich. Tips:Their busiest time ranges from 11:30 to 2pm everyday. It's a must to CALL ahead and order through the phone in order to spare yourself about 1 hr of waiting. Once you make your order, they will give you a time when it's ready to pick up and pay. Apparently they are being sued by their neighbors and their business might be in trouble. Perhaps the crowd gets rowdy or loud but loosing Ike's Place will be a total loss for the city. I truly hope they can ride out this stupid lawsuit and continue their great work. IKE'S PLACE NEEDS TO STAY
Ike's is flippin delicious! I told a friend that it was like a really rich man's version of Potbelly's. By the blank stare I received and a follow up google search to confirm, I realized that there are no Potbelly's anywhere near SF. My comment still applies, though super rich.My journey to Ike's was about some 8 months in the making. My last time in SF, I was teased with the prospects of eating here as well as by the many vegan and vegetarian mouth watering options on their menu. What was left out was the 45 minute or so wait that came with the territory, that due to our time constraints made a visit impossible. It also inspired a handful of fat kid spots that I had to eat at during this visit, so I guess it wasn't all bad. After about 10 minutes of looking over the menu, I decided on the Wario. The award winning vegan meat balls intrigued me, but really the cheesesticks really sold me. I also went for the healthier option over the Bowzer, which was the same sandwich with jalapeno poppers. Yes I just called a cheesestick sandwich healthy, I was on vacation. After the fiasco that was the last attempted Ike's visit, we got smart and called ahead with the order. The ambiance is a bit lacking, and there was a rather brisk wind that was going thru the place, but none of that mattered once I got the sandwich in its extra dirty state. I really should have ordered a couple more, as I was still a bit hungry, but I had other eateries to hit up during my visit. On a side note, if you ever do eat at Potbellys, please don't curse me out for using it in this comparison as it isn't in the Ike's class at all, but is probably my preferred stop when the other options are Subway, Jimmy John's or Quizno's.
ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE NEW LOCATION at LIMES! This new location right around the corner from the old one is definitely 1000000x better. Not only can you stand in line and not feel bad for being rowdy, but you also get to sit down to eat right when you get your sandwiches (or even before if you preordered by phone). Lime always Ike's to operate and use their entire space during the day until the evening hours. My friend and I revisited yesterday, waited about 20 minutes in line to pay for our sandwiches that we ordered by phone a couple hours before and just sat down inside to escape the wind/occasional rain while we waited for our delicious sandwiches. We both ordered the Eli Manning on dutch crunch with everything. SO GOOD. Thank you, Lime, for letting Ike's use your space! And thank you, Ikes, for the great friendly service and delicious sandwiches as always!
I don't own an iPhone, I don't wear Tom's, and I don't like Ike's -- in other words, I'm a bad San Franciscan. Actually, that's not entirely true... the food at Ike's is pretty good, just not really any better than any other sandwich shop and CERTAINLY not worth the ridiculous line.Going to Ike's is not something you do on a whim. Going to Ike's is a full day event that requires planning and coordination. The last time I tried to go, I waited in a line outside the store about 20 people deep. I was patient and braved the line, but kept an eye on my watch. I was in line for twenty minutes (and this is not an exaggeration) and the line moved up three people. Keep in mind, this was simply the line to order, and there was definitely a significant wait for picking up sandwiches too. At the rate I was going, I was going to need to order lunch and dinner simultaneously.Instead, I got out of line and walked two blocks to another sandwich shop and had a great tasting sandwich with nothing more than a few minutes of waiting. Ike's definitely makes a good sandwich, but it is only marginally better than what you can find elsewhere in the city, and the ridiculous line and the over-hyped nature of it make it completely unappealing to me.I would eat Ike's again, but not until everyone else stops going.
Great place. Was up from Los Angeles doing a job and discovered this gem. Had the Menage a Trois with fried chicken. RAD! Supposed to open up an L.A. location can't wait.
What more can I say that hasn't already been said. EXCELLENT Sandwiches!!! I tried the Lincecum which comes with ham, turkey, bacon, avocado, and havarti. It was delicious! Definitely lived up to the hype. I will definitely be back to try another sandwich!
When my friend suggested trying a sandwich shop that everyone was talking about, I immediately envisioned a reuben sandwich piled high with pastrami and covered with sauerkraut. I began to salivate much like I do when I hear the sound of a bell ringing.We arrived at Ike's at about 1:45 PM on a Friday. The line was out the door. There weren't any tables, so the open area in the front part of the store served as a waiting area for those whose orders were already placed. The cashier mentioned that the 'Menage a Trois' and the 'Paul Reubens' are two of their more popular sandwiches. Since I didn't know the lady very well, I didn't feel comfortable asking for a 'Menage a Trois'. So, I went with the 'Paul Reubens' on Dutch Crunch Bread.The sandwich was pretty darn good. And, the more I ate, the more I seemed to like it. The bread was soft inside with a light crunch on the outside. The combination of pastrami, cole slaw and sauce was quite delicious. The sandwich could have used more meat. The slice of pastrami was thick, but one or two more slices would have made it perfect. Check out the picture on their website and you will see what I mean.I will definitely be back to try some of their other sandwiches, but only during off peak times. I will wait 30 minutes for one of their sandwiches but not much longer than that.
Awesome. They dont skimp on the sauces. Soft bread.
There is little I can say that others haven't. The Food:AMAZING! I'm gluten-free and they are the ONLY place in the city that makes amazing GF sandwiches! I love the Say Hey plus salami and extra dirty sauce.The Ambiance:The new place is much better than when they were at Lime and bigger than the old place. The Price:Seems steep but for what you get, it's perfect.
This is actually my second time coming here. First round almost two years ago, I tried the Menage a Trois, which I found a bit disappointing: too sweet, too saucy, and too messy. This time around, boyfriend and I split the "Going Home for Thanksgiving" on Dutch Crunch. We walked over to Bi-Rite and ate the sandwich while standing in line. The sandwich was big enough to satisfy two, and left us with just enough room for ice cream.But about the "Going Home for Thanksgiving"... AMAZING. Dirty sauce plus cranberry sauce (with real cranberries!) plus Sriracha sauce equals mindblowing flavor fest. I was genuinely devastated to finish the last bite. It was absolute flavor explosion from first bite to last. Somehow, it had every flavor, but was not at all overwhelming. I generally have very picky taste buds (I won't even eat peppercinis or olives because I think they're too flavorful), but this sandwich left me gushing.Five stars because even though my first visit was disappointing, this last trip more than made up for it. However, Ike's is definitely a once-in-a-while treat.After the last bite, I looked up at my boyfriend and said: "If you were this sandwich..."
What can you say about Ike's that hasn't already been said? They have perfected their craft and have managed to be extremely consistent (the holy grail for any restaurant). If there is ever a problem with your order, they will gladly and without hesitation make things right for you. I've been trying to figure out what is in that dirty sauce, it is amazing. How can it be vegan? What is it???
4.0 StarsSo I'd like to welcome Ike's to their temporary new home at Lime. I remember visiting Ike's at its previous location and Lime is a definite upgrade! The first thing you'll notice is there's actually sitting room. Now you can enjoy your delicious sandwich in the comforts of a sleek, modern, and vibrant interior.Being a complete noob the first time around, I didn't want to make the same mistake of waiting a long 45 minutes for my sandwich. After following the tips of fellow Yelpers I decided to call in today to place my sandwich order. Surprisingly enough this worked like a charm and my delightful order was patiently awaiting my arrival. The sandwich I tried today wasn't exactly on the printed menu and I feel slightly special for knowing about it. It was called the "660" ($9.99) and it consisted of Pastrami, Swiss, Bacon, and Avocado. I decided to put all the veggies in my sandwich and that included lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, pickles, and banana peppers. To top it all off, Ike's slabs on their signature Dirty Sauce that tastes really similar to garlic aioli.Overall I enjoyed my sandwich, but it didn't blow me away as being the best sandwich I have ever eaten. I'll admit the sandwich may look small, but it's piled with ingredients. For those with a bigger appetite, the added bag of Dirty chips and Caramel Apple lollipop with your order are also a plus . For choices of bread you can pick from French, Wheat, Sourdough, and Dutch Crunch. Dutch Crunch was an easy pick for me because I love the textured top of the crust. Having Dutch Crunch also separates Ike's from other sandwich shops because it's not offered everywhere. Ike's sandwiches do cost a premium over other sandwich places (i.e. 2 times the price at Subway), but the high quality ingredients and the variety of the sandwiches help it stand out over the competition.== A MUST TRY! ==
more options on line than there check their website before going
So what can I tell you that the over 1000 reviews (as of this date), don't already say? Well, that the sandwiches here are laced with crack. They have to be, because they're downright addictive! While sadly there is no place to sit and enjoy your sandwich inside, the service is quick and if you haven't caught on already, the sandwiches are fantastic! The have a large and varies selection so there is a little something for everyone for vegetarians to meat lovers.
Praise the lord--Ike's has opened up a new location up the block, and the sandwiches are just as good! There is actually seating inside now, but Lime's decor doesn't really match Ike's sandwiches. Lime is better suited for downing bottomless mimosas...anyone get what I'm trying to say? It's still nice to have the option to dine in though. I recognized some employees from their former location and they're just as friendly and spunky as they were before. Ike's, I'll be your fangirl for life.
Backstabber sandwich is pretty darn fantastic. A pretty hipster joint so you'll see a substantial line form around lunch time. It feels a little pricey for a gourmet sandwich but you won't regret it. It's a must if you're a sandwich fan. Parking is street only, but it's not as busy as union square so you should be ok.
I have nothing bad to say about the sandwich I got here. It was huge, delicious, and the wait wasn't too long. My only complaint would just be that the entire thing fell apart SO quickly. And when it wasn't falling apart, it was dripping all over me. And I'm not a messy eater. I keep that shit pretty much wrapped while I eat it. It was definitely a deal breaker for me between a 4 and a 5. I might suggest toothpicks?
Okay this is my favorite place to get a sandwich (when I'm not dieting). Once I find a sandwich I really like I don't like to experiment ..and the first time you go to Ike's their menu can be a bit overwhelming..so I just asked for some recommendations from the guy who worked there and he gave me a couple to choose from.. I got the backstabber with the works..and it's the only one I order whenever I go there (I've never had any other sandwich there) Some advice: call in advance (at least an hour) and order your sandwiches and just go and pick them up otherwise the line to order and then waiting can be long depending on the time of day. Also, if you're dieting..this probably isn't a good choice even though it's "just" a sandwich-- they are big and you end up eating the entire thing which is a lot. Okay, so you could probably eat half the sandwich and then the other half later..but seriously, who has that kind of will power when faced with a sandwich from Ike's? I certainly do not.
Even though this place is unimaginably busy (envision waiting 20+ mins on any given day), it's spectacular. Their staff is fabulous and their sandwiches will knock your socks off. I stopped by there with the Scoutmob promotion and tried the Elvis Keith - wow. Twas ferociously tasty folks!If the CASTRO location weren't so overrun by mission hipsters I'd frequent this place much, much more. Great job though and I'm happy the new location is working out!
My family and I, on our visit to San Francisco heard about a good sandwich spot called "Ike's Place" but had no idea what we were about to experience. These sandwiches have to be one of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten in my entire life! I had the Lex Luthor sandwich, and while it may sound like a bit overkill with the chicken fried steak and mozzarella sticks, the sandwich is layered nicely and somehow fits perfectly together. My wife, cousin and daughter had the M.I.L.F and Pizzle and they too loved their sandwiches. We loved absolutely everything about this store, the location, the atmosphere and even the small details such as the suckers that they place into every bag as a little after dinner treat. When visiting San Francisco, you would be doing yourself an injustice if you didn't visit this place!
How many sandwiches still taste hella good 2 hours later, unrefrigerated mind you, after you bought it? I don't know, but Ike's does!On one of my spontaneously ambitious days, I decided to: 1) Caltrain up to SF, 2) run 3 miles to finally try out this Ike's Place I've been hearing all about, 3) eat my sangwich, 4) then work off those calories at the nearby 24 Hour Fitness, and 5) go home. Well, I got up to step 2 with a Nacho Boy sandwich in hand when I realized that there was no place to eat it (this was when they were still at the original location). With all the complaints about the loitering issues and possible shutdown, I didn't want them to get in trouble because I sat on the curb and started noshing on my sandwich. So I stashed the sandwich in my running bag and went straight to the 24HF to work out first instead.By the time I got that out of the way, I had to debate whether I should eat it then or start on my way home. I still didn't have a place to eat, so I just decided to head on back. Sangwich is still sitting in my bag doing its thing. When I got to the SF Shopping Center, I decided to plop my butt in the food court and finally have at it. Factor in all the running and whatnot, I was pretty famished at this point, but I was still worried whether I had made a mistake in letting this precious Ike's sandwich marinate in my running bag for a couple of hours.Dude. It was still good. STILL HELLA GOOD!!! I was only left wondering how much better could it taste had I eaten it right away. But I didn't really care at this point - that sandwich in front of me was so perfect, the dirty sauce was perfectly in sync with the roast beef, and the avocado added that nice creamy texture... I want another one right now.Come here. Try their sandwiches. If it was still ridiculously good after what I put it through, you're bound to love when it's freshly made.
My vege sandwich was GOOOD! I think a bit pricey for just a sandwich and small bag of chips but sometimes that's just how it goes.
This place further supports my belief that hole-in-the-wall places are often the BEST of the BEST. So I've been here three times already, and just discovered this place last week. I've gotten the Backstabber, which has extremely yummy sliced chicken, artichokes, and ranch dressing with fresh lettuce, and the Super Wario, with meatless meat, MOZZARELLA STICKS, and marinara. That's right. Mozzarella sticks, in a sandwich. I wolfed down both with vigor and heard my stomach sing. The sandwiches are seriously fantastic. The fake meat is surprisingly tasty and satisfying (note to non-veggies as well as veggies). The service is awesome and the guys actually remember you when you come back--plus the complimentary Tootsie pop is just a sweet gesture in and of itself. The third sandwich I got was actually free! My friends and I had gone down there yesterday after 6, which was their closing time, and we were completely crestfallen....until one of the guys offered us 2 spare sandwiches to split among the four of us!!! We never found out which ones they were, but needless to say, they were amazing and gobbled up fast.It is now my own personal goal to try every sandwich they have. (They have a catalog of all their sandwiches on the counter, take a look through! Not everything is on the menus up on the walls.) If you're a sandwich fiend, a fresh food fiend, a quick food type of guy or just a regular foodie, you've got to try this place!!!Subway who?
Does Ike's need another review? Nah, but how else am I going to tell you about this great sandwich I had called the Nacho Boy?Great bread, avocado galore, yummy meat. And sauce. Lots of sauce. Dirty sauce, you might even say. Well, that's what they call it.It was the first thing I ate when I got off the plane and if I lived in SF, I'd probably do a menu tour until I tried every last one of the sandwiches.We took our sandwiches to nearby Delores Park and had a lovely picnic. They have chips and funny artisinal sodas as well to aid in the picnic.
Five stars for the BEST sandwiches EVER. Want a sandwich that isn't skimpy on the meats/stuffing? Craving a tasty sandwich that is fresh, delicious, made-to-order and melts in your mouth? Ike's will totally hit the spot and leave you dreaming for more. On Saturday, I waited in line for a sandwich for over two hours (yes, I got to know my neighboring people really well), and I was not disappointed! I would do it again- gladly. (To pass time, bring a book, your friends, your dog, your cell phone, get to know your neighbors or the Ike's staff who manage the line, etc.) Or call in~! Tons of people called in their orders and came to pick them up. Super smart of them, huh?My boyfriend and I ordered the Doomsday, which is a huggggeee, heavenly sandwich stuffed with meats (bacon, roast beef, corned hash, pastrami, salami, turkey, ham), cheese, Nick's special sauce, jalapeno poppers and spicy habenero salsa that adds a great kick. The sandwich was so big that it lasted us for two meals!The prices are very reasonable for the quantity and quality that you receive from Ike's Place. For example, I ordered the Doomsday at $18. So $18 for a gigantic sandwich shared by two people over two meals? Sounds like a win!I also met Ike. He was sooo gracious and kind. He thanked me for braving the wait and said that he hoped I liked the sandwich because he knew it was my first time there. He's very sweet and energetic. Also, good news for Peninsula people: Ike's is opening a restaurant on the Stanford Campus! Woot woot!
Amazing! I worked in Redwood City and the entire office went nutso when we ordered lunch from Ike's (in rwc). I was like - what's the big deal, it's a sandwich shop! Why are you all acting crazy?!It's not just a sandwich shop - it's a creative, vegan, vegetarian, junk-food craving, meat-eating friendly sandwich shop. As a vegetarian, I loved all the options available to me. Only disclaimer - the sandwiches are huge - a half portion is super filling. The dirty sauce that comes on the sandwich is good - but don't let it sit on your desk for four hours and then try to eat it. Stomach, meet ache. Of course - if it's vegan dirty sauce, that might be a different story!
I finally made it to the new location today. Not much to add in the hundreds of reviews, but the Womanizer was delicious. I don't usually like much sauce in general, but the Dirty Sauce is yummy! Everyone who worked there was friendly and had a great attitude, too. I called my order in, but they advised me to just come in as it was a longer wait for phone orders.My only minor gripe is the price. It's a lot to pay for a sandwich, but Ike's is great for that once-in-a-while treat.
Damn good West Coast sandwich joint. No seating. Ten minute (minimum) wait for your sandwich. Well worth that wait. Their online menu is larger; try it out. (Get the phone app and skip the wait entirely).I am an unhappy New Yorker, addicted to this joint.
I had heard so much about Ike's so I finally walked over today to try. Survey says: Overrated. I got the Barry B. I think it was kind of gross actually. I like that they didn't put an unnecessary amount of meat and I do like lettuce, but overall the sandwich had kind of a bitter taste to it. Certainly not "the best" as everyone claims. This isn't so much of an issue for me, but they had like 6 people working and it still took forever to get the sandwich. There were only a couple of people ahead of me and they were waiting since I got there. Seems a bit silly. The staff was really nice though. They do give you a free bag of chips with the sandwich. Like many other SF sandwich places though, it was over priced. I've found places for $5.50 and the sandwiches are better.
Absolutely stellar sandwiches.The selection is daunting, and often (though not when we went, at about 3 pm on a Thursday) the line is even more so. Call ahead for joy!We went, after much deliberation and some wheel-spinning, for the 'Mnage a trois' (halal chicken breast [Note: the chicken breast comes shredded, wet and DELICIOUS], real honey, honey mustard, bbq [just enough bbq! the sandwich was not overwhelmingly bbq-flavored], pepperjack) and the "'Hella' Fat Bastard" (ham, bacon, extra dirty sauce, american - 'Hella' means that they put HOT MOZZARELLA STICKS ON IT. That's right. And it's AWESOME.)We each did half of each sandwich, and I almost died it was so much food. Not finishing was NOT an option.A note on the bread: We had one sourdough and one Dutch crunch. I don't remember which was which, but both were absolutely amazing, toasted to perfection.The dirty sauce is key. Seriously, don't bother avoiding it. You'd be sad, even if you didn't know it.
Ike's in Santa Rosa has it all. Wow, what a complete selection of great sandwich's
Dear (Name of girl I'm dating),An ode to a sandwichWhen I we first met, to be honest, my expectations were low though you stood out amongst the rest. I didn't want to leave myself high and dry so I hoped for the best and prepared for the worst. A golden brown, ingredients that complement each other perfectly, a shape that fits perfectly in my hands, sounds like a winner right?When you first touched my lips, it was an experience unlike any other. A cornucopia of sensations in my mouth, sweet, savory, soft, crunchy. It wasn't mind blowing but it was just right for what I wanted at the time. As I progressed you got better. You didn't fall apart or become mushy over time like the rest. I couldn't think of anything about you that I would change but as they say, all good things must come to an end.In the end, it was shorter than I had hoped. I didn't want a one night stand, I wanted to stick around and build a relationship. I was sad to see you go. You certainly raised the bar. (Name of girl I'm dating), you were different from the rest. You were special.Sincerely, MeP.S. I'll see you again soon.Seriously one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life. Halal chicken breast (green light for all the Muslim folks), honey mustard, avacado, peper jack cheese, dutch crunch bread perfectly complemented with 2 Bubble Ups. Amazing. Not too heavy yet fills you up without feeling stuffed. I also tried a few other sandwiches...King Koopa, 16th & Market, Pride of Castro and 1 other and they were also very good. Damn you Ike's for being a SF exclusive.WORTH THE WAIT!
Not once have I ever been unsatisfied after picking up an Ike's sandwich. Every sandwich I have tried has been delicious.Even the chips and drink options are excellent. You might as well just point your finger at any choice and go with whatever you land on. You won't be disappointed.Every sandwich has its own amazing sauce and mixture of other goodies. You got to go try it.
I. Love. Ike's Place. The sandwiches are amazing to say the least. The sandwiches are a bit messy to eat, but SO worth it. And price wise, but there is no questions that I would pay much more for one of them. The first time I went to Ike's I got the Paul Reubens and my friend got the Spiffy Tiffy. It was really nice sitting outside the library up the block from Ike's chowing down on the sandwiches, trying not to drop stuff all over ourselves. The second time I went to get Ike's was for dinner before a Giants game. I got the Matt Cain (in honor of the pitcher that night) and my friend got the SF Giants. The Godfather sauce on the Matt Cain is AMAZING. Again, messy to eat, especially in the bleacher seats, but so worth it. The selection of their menu is absolutely incredible. Everything looks delicious, and I'm sure that they are. All I have left to say is, if you live in SF, and you haven't gone to Ike's Place before, you are missing out on some amazing stuff. And now since I live in Santa Cruz because of college, I REALLY miss Ike's and I cannot wait to head back up and get myself an amazing sandwich.
I am fairly new to the world of sandwich love but I have to say of all the sandwiches that I have eaten, Ike's are the highest ranking. SO many to choose from and I love that I can get veggie or vegan or gluten free AND they still taste AWESOME! I bring anybody visiting the city to Ike's and they become instantly obsessed. I can't recommend them high enough. Eat here and you won't be able to stay away.Worth the wait!
Flat out, the best sandwiches in SF. I try to vary what I get but keep coming back to the "Name of the girl I'm dating." Really sloppy, but oh so good. My dog likes to steal the suckers. Actually, she likes to steal the sandwich as well, but she's only succeeded once there and only the last 1/3 of the sandwich.Call ahead to avoid the lines. Kind of amusing that they got in trouble for the long lines on the sidewalk across the street but all is OK the other side of the street.Hey Ike, how about a breakfast sandwich?
It doesn't look like this place needs a review, but I am giving one anyway. This place has just opened up in Santa Rosa and I am very impressed with its menu and workers. The place here in SF is outstanding and the quality of its sandwiches are fantastic. I applaud them for keeping the quality in their service and not losing any of its prime functionality with its service.
Place is off the hook! I got a coupon for a buy one get one free and got enough grub to feed my bros after a high powered game of hoops. The Kryptonite is NO JOKE! Thanks Ike's Place.
I will never eat at any other Sandwich place for the rest of my life! Best vegetarian selection, awesome bread, great service and tasted decadent! I will probably go broke trying to sample each vegetarian selection I can ASAP! OMG I'm mad at the fact that I've lived here for al,out seven months and I hadn't eaten an Ike's sandwich. So so good. I went there in the rain with my toddler the whole time thinking this better be a damn good sandwich, it was well worth it! I even have the app downloaded on my phone to order for quick pick up. Can't wait to go back!
Ike's sandwiches are the best I have ever had, and I eat a lot of sandwiches ;-) I am a faithful patron.Napolean Complex is my favorite. The wait for the sandwiches sucks, but if you deal with it you will be rewarded! My first Ike's experience involved me hunched over my table (back at home) with the sauces dripping down my arms, avocado smeared everywhere, and the biggest smile on my face. Gross picture? Maybe. Worth the wait and the mess to clean up? Definitely.Brave the wait, and see for yourself. Bet you can't go just once.
6K reviews? what are they doing here? i had to know. apparently they make a good sandwich with good sauce. Not really the life changing experience i had hoped for with 6K+ reviews. Would be nice if they had a table or two.
Simply amazing!!!!!
The Change burger was AMAZING. My friend got the Matt Cain, which was also delicious. I don't know how they do it, but I could eat here every day.
Yes, it's that good. All the sandwiches are creative and there are a ton to choose from. They've also got a pretty good vegan and vegetarian list. I want to keep going back so I can try all the different kinds. They're juicy and dripping all over, extra napkins required. They load up on the veggies and aren't afraid to pack in the meats. Ike himself is present and is as cool as ever, you can tell he's more than happy to be hand serving all his goods. The shop is as small as it gets and the waits can get long. But not to fret, the hardworking sandwich staff can get them turned around pretty quick. And maybe it's the lack of tables outside that makes the whole experience that much tastier? I will be sure to come back to Ike's when I can!
AMAZING FOOD.I had their BLTA--the bread was very tasty and had a great texture, the bacon was delicious, and the dirty secret sauce just tied it all together. One star off for having virtually no seating, an outrageous line out the door, and okay customer service. Bottom line: I would definitely go back, but would call ahead to order and go to a nearby park to eat.
If you want a sandwich to go (no seating in or around the place) this is almost as good as it gets. Great Dutch Crunch filled with lots of unique flavor. If you prefer your sandwich to be dripping with sauce and un-run of the mill fillings, grab one and head to Dolores Park. On a weekend, expect a long line (but if you have the time, worth the wait).
Naturally I ordered the Super Mario sandwich because that's the best way to get mozarella sticks at this joint. (I'm not so sopisticated and like appetizers in my entree) I don't remember ever eating a better sandwich. The ambience and the crew of this little whole in the wall is fantastic too.There is an incongruence to standing in line (potentially for hours) for something (simple as a sandwich) intended to be take and go, but you can't fault Ike's for being so tasty.
There is not much I can really say about this place that pretty much everyone else hasn't said already. The sandwiches are all amazing. They are full of flavor and you can get them just the way you want them. I haven't run into a bad sandwich yet.My favorite sandwiches have to be the Menois a Trois or the Matt Caine loaded with free jalapenos and wax peppers. I have to admit that their sandwiches have to be the best in the city! They make it look so easy.
This was the best Sandwich that I have had. Big and filling. If I lived in SF I would be eat There all the time. The price was good for what you got. Just plan on taking your sandwich with you there no place to eat in side. Wish there where more place like IKE'S!
Danger Will Robinson! Going in when the Lime is open means the worlds best sandwich paired with an amazing cocktail. Who woulda thought a straight guy would find such bliss to put in his mouth while in the Castro
We originally tried going to the one located in Redwood city, but failed to get in because its only accessible through an employee access card, blaH... Finding parking may be difficult around here. We arrived on a sunday early afternoon and was suprisingly busy. To avoid waiting I suggest calling ahead and order your sandwich. Their sandwiches are PRICEY, but its big enough to share a sandwich with a friend. I was so FULL, halfway through my sandwich. I had the MILF which consisted of shredded halal chicken marinated in franks red hot sauce, stuffed jalapenos, ranch and your usual tomato and lettuce. It was very creamy, not as spicy as I had hoped for.  There's no place to sit inside, you pretty much order at their door and wait on the sidewalk for your order. My friend had the Lex Luthor which cost about $18, its so BIG that theres two parts to it. Your given two sandwiches. They also give you this sour green apple caramel lollipop which was a nice touch. IKE'S= unique sandwich combinations with funny names and friendly service.
The Menage A Trois is the perfect combination of all the things I love in a sandwich: the dutch crunch bread, chicken breast, dirty sauce, the combination of the honey, honey mustard and bbq sauce, swiss, gouda cheeses..the list goes on. It sounds like there's too much going on but it works. I've thought about getting something else I just could not bear to deviate...The sandwiches are substantial so I save the other half for later if I don't have anyone to share it with. I've had my leftover sandwiches cold (right out of the fridge) and out of the toaster oven. Still great.My only qualm is their new location out of Lime. Unless, I'm on vacation, I don't want to be part of a drinking, loud music, club scene on a Saturday afternoon but since there is always a wait for Ike's, I have to stand around and be surrounded by it. Every now and then, I dream about Ike's sandwiches. It's always a good dream.
Will rate on individual areas:food -- 5 stars -- delish!!!service/location/wait -- 2 stars -- crowded, long lines, noisy!prices -- wow -- crazy! $48 for 3 sandwiches, chips and sodas. For this amount, I want a table and chair to eat it at, not handed to me in a brown paper bag and instructions not to eat it on the sidewalk outside...
Like the Etta James's song beautifully written, "At last, my love has come alongMy lonely days are overAnd life is like a songOh, yeah, at lastThe skies above are blueMy heart was wrapped up in clovers"I had finally made it to the Ike's place in San Francisco! After two previous failed attempt to come by to Ike's place, I was certain to not fail this time around when I was near by the area. And finally, finally.... I can say had tried the infamous Ike's place that was highly raved about. The sandwiches place with their specialize "dirty sauce," the "dutch crunch," the sandwiches shop with mind blowing sandwich names.I dragged my ever so dear twin Steph Y here and although she was not hungry has also end up ordering a sandwich as well. I got the 1/2 spiffy tiffy: Which came with Halal Chicken Breast, Pesto, Mushrooms, Avocado, Pepper Jack. Provolon and of course plus the dirty sauce. (ask yep suggest, I asked for extra dirty sauce!) I thought the halal style was a extra touch to their menu. Perfect for all those people who preferred halal meat. Price: for little bit under 11 bucks.Verdict: 1/2 spiffy tiffy did not promise too much avocado, which was bit disappointing. My friend and I both agree that it will taste better if there were bit more avocado. My friend got the Papa Sam. Which came with Wild Salmon, Dirty Sauce, Havarti, extra dirty sauce of course.Verdict: Surprisingly, my friend's sandwich was delicious. Surprise because since I am such a meat lover I would normally never thought of ordering a seafood sandwich. As much as I love Ike's here is the reason why the 4 stars. The two sandwiches were both for almost $11 bucks. Pretty expensive for a sandwich if you ask me. Plus it was very greasy.
I probably got lucky not having to wait a super long time for my Ike's sandwich. The dirty sauce is probably the best part of the sandwich. I had the Spiffy Tiffy (halal chicken, pesto, pepper jack, avocado...and I forget what else) with their Dutch Crunch bread. Pretty good. I wish their location had tables for you to sit at and eat though.
I've been here maybe a hundred times and it is always SO. DAMN. GOOD. I found out about Ike's through a friend shortly after I moved to SF and although he is quite the carnivore, assured me that they had vegetarian/vegan friendly sandwiches. Gotta love it. I think I went to Ike's every day for a month. The first sandwich I tried was the veggie Trinity and I fell in love. After some recommendations from the employees I decided to try some of the other sandwiches and to my surprise, they were all equally delicious. I'm always scared to stray from a good thing when I find it but I was not disappointed.The staff is very nice and the only downside could be the wait time (it's still worth it). I always called ahead and never had to wait too long for my food.EAT HERE!!!!!!!!!
I came here almost a year ago and figured its time for my review. I kept on seeing it on all the food channels and I love a great sandwich. I was telling my girlfriend about it so we decided to try it out during a lunch date in the city. After hearing that there was a long wait she suggested calling our order in. There we're so many different types of sandwiches to choose from I could not decide. You are sure to find something to satisfy your craving. Its not cheap, but definitely worth it. When we arrived around 11 it was packed. People were sitting all along the wall waiting patiently for their order. Although the place was crazy busy you can see that the workers enjoyed being there. The place doesn't have much seating so we picked up our order and went around the corner to Dolores Park. It was a beautiful day, great company and an awesome sandwich. I can't wait to go back!
im not sure if its because everyone put so much into ikes and talked it up but it definitely was not what i was expecting yeah there decent sandwhiches but nothing memorable long line long wait no parking ... super overpriced.
What everyone else said (as in it's good, you should definitely go), but...1) Their menu is an eyesore. Omg.2) The names of the menu items don't make any sense, which is kind of cute, but mostly don't make any sense. And makes it harder for me to figure out what I want. See #1 If I had to judge solely on the food, it'd get 4 1/2 stars. The quality of the ingredients is somewhat lacking compared to some of my favorite delis.
I have been here a couple more times. Rating remains the same - though I am seriously surprised at their lines. I get the feeling that their assembly line in the back could use some help in organizing better for increased throughput. I once waited 45mins for a sandwich (don't ask why I didn't just walk out... ). Oh well... It's a good place to come in once in a while for their distinctive taste but I have neither the time nor $ to become a regular.
So maybe the line was extremely long today because the eviction date is drawing nearer and everyone is trying to get a sandwich before they close or I am just extremely unlucky today (I spilled my drink on my fav. jeans and rushed to 2 different stores but it was closed 2 - 4 minutes before muni got me there). So let's just say it was my bad luck that had me waiting for over an hour to get my sandwich. Waiting over an hour to get a sandwich is NOT okay with me but it seem like a waste of time to just stand there forever and give up! I got the Matt Cain sandwich on a dutch crunch and honestly it was good. It was one tasty sandwich, but not tasty enough for me to come back to wait in line. I would definitely come back (before the eviction date of course) if the line moved faster otherwise I rather wait in line at The Sentinel.
Got the Tim Lincecum sandwich, very expensive but very good. Free bag of chips with every sandwich.
best sandwich ever!!!! always busy! can't atop in when your in a rush! besides you need time to enjoy your sandwich!
Despite being born and raised in SF, I've never really ventured out to the Castro area and haven't had a chance to try Ike's. But I've definitely heard about it. After all the buzz, I finally decided to head down there with a friend and see what all the fuss was about!When I got there, there wasn't a line at the register, which was good because it took me way too long to decide what to order. The cashier was super friendly and helpful with her recommendations. I definitely felt like I was a valued customer. I ended up deciding to get the [Name of Girl I'm Dating] because I had a hankering for avocado.The wait wasn't too long and my sandwiches came out. There wasn't any seating in the establishment. There was only benches along the walls, which I expected people waiting to sit at. So, we decided to take our food out and picnic at Dolores Park. (Thank god it wasn't too cold.)The sandwiches were really good, but the consistency of the chicken kind of threw me off. It was shredded and it reminded me of tuna. I wasn't sure if I liked the texture. I didn't taste as much avocado as I wanted as well, which was a disappointment.But the sandwiches are surprisingly dense and I was full after just half of the sandwich. I saved the second half and ate it hours later. Surprisingly, I liked the sandwich more after a few hours. I don't quite know why.Overall, it was a good experience and I would come back, but I wish there was some seating..
I LOVE this place. Best sandwich i've ever had. the reason Ike's get a 4-start from is the wait and the whole "Appointment Only" deli.Food wise, this place rocks. service is good, but it could be better.
I decided to come here one day, after hearing so many good things about this place.My bf and I had nothing to do anyways, so we decided to stand in the semi-long line and order some sandwiches. It was around 6:00PM by the time we lined up. During our wait, some of the staff decided to loosen up our impatience by creating a wave down the line. Hah, unsuccessful the first few tries but I appreciate their enthusiasm anyways! Blame the others who are too cool to put their arms up. I didn't get to order until 10PM! Crazzy. They still gave us complimentary chips and soda, probably cause it was their last day. Downed that bag of chips like it was nothingggg. Ended up ordering the Holy Name Panthers which consisted of vegan breaded chicken, ike's red pesto, ranch, and pepperjack for 9.99.By the time the owner called out my name, it was already 11PM! I gave him a hug and thanked him :)It wasn't a spectacular sandwich, and it really was not worth waiting for straight up five hours while having the camera crew capture some of the last few faces of the customers. I would definitely order another sandwich from ike's located elsewhere. Sad to see it shut down though
Best place I ate a sandwich at ! So I heard about this place over the news since they were supposed to close. But good thing they aren't closing yet. So me n my boyfriend came here on a Thursday night. The line gets pretty long so don't come at like 8ish cuz they close at 9. We waited 20 min to order and 15 min to get our sandwich. It was hella worth the wait tho! It's a little pricey also, we got 2 sandwiches and paid $24. They also have happy hour weekdays 5-9 I believe. You get a free drink and chips!
Not from San Francisco, & lunch time approached, my best friend mentioned we have to go to this Sandwich place.. that came out in Man vs Food. I couldn't help but think, "A sandwich place? You're kidding, right? I eat Subway in LA all the time!!" We pass by & see this huge crowd of young people [hipster-ish] eating chips & drinking soda pop outside. We start debating if we should go since the line is so long & that decision was made to a yes when we found parking. The place [Ike's place] is very small. No wonder all orders are to go, right? once you order your food, you get the chips & soda [if you decide to purchase them with your sandwich] & wait for them to call our name & hand you your sub. We waited maybe 30 minutes altogether. I had the [Name of Girl I'm Dating] &... it was the best sandwich I have ever eaten! I was in sheer heaven while eating that sandwich inside of our parked car. I hope they expand more & come to LA :)
Mmmm mm mm. I have mastered the art of not waiting in line at Ikes. Typically, it's simply finding the right hours to go. If you must go during rush hour, call in and save yourself the wait. Otherwise, best to head over there early in the morning (10 or 11), or late afternoon or early evening.Oh, you want to know about the sandwiches? Everything is good. I almost want to eat beef again just so I can try the challenge (Kryptonite, Lex Luthor, and Superman).P.S. Everything can be made veggie, vegan, etc. Honestly, they put Burger King's "Have it your way" to shame.
My boyfriend and I went at 7pm on a Monday night and had a 15 min wait, tops. Go at the right time and you won't wait. Any sandwich you get is going to be scrumptious, so you can't go wrong. But I HIGHLY recommend the 3-some...aka, Mnage  trois. Comes with REAL honey, honey BBQ and so many other delicious toppings. Get it loaded with all veggies and don't look back.Oh, and good tip - go across the street and eat at the outdoor seating at Tangerine. Though we got really nasty looks from the wait staff there, we didn't give a damn because we knew they were jealous. They weren't having Ike's and they were very upset as they were GAWKING at our flavorful pieces of art - aka Ike's Sandwiches.
I think the hype just killed it for me. While I like the sandwiches from Ike's, I'm sad to report that I don't LOVE them.  I was really expecting a really great garlic and spice kick from the dirty sauce but found that the flavors were muted....maybe there was just too much of the other ingredients for the dirty sauce to come through? I had the Spiffy Tiffy, while my dining companions had a Menage a Trois (best sandwich of the bunch!), a Paul Reubens, a Hollywood's San Francisco Cheesesteak, and a MILF. While the staff really does do their very best to get everyone's order ready and moving along, there were some hiccups. My order was supposed to be ready at 12:45 pm but it took until almost 1 pm for my order to get to me...not too cool when it took forever just to get the phone call in to make the order.Overall 3 stars for now, but I'd head back to try some of their other sandwich combinations.
I had heard about Ike's from a friend and was interested in trying this infamous "dirty sauce" of theirs. After hearing the hustle and bustle that Ike's Place on 16th Street was being evicted and relocated to an undisclosed location, I felt it absolutely necessary to wait 40 minutes in line, and another for my sandwich. Afterall, I need an extra shot of dirty sauce.When the Jessica Rabbit Vegetarian style on sourdough hit my lips, it was a whole new level of Zelda's Kingdom, Mario World 3 on NES, and a Star Trek combined in ONE. I had reached enlightenment. At that point, only obscenities and religious names said in vain could exit my vocal chords -- my mind was blown, it was that good. This sandwich has set the standard too high in ALL aspects of life. I'm pretty sure that orgasms will soon be compared to an Ike's Place Sandwich.Spending $21.00 for two sandwiches, two drinks, and two bags of chips was well worth it. The quality and size of Ike was definitely too much for my glory hole. So many flavors. So much dirty sauce. So much to smell, be, and take in, I inevitably fell into comatose by sensory overload. I have found nirvana, only to have it ripped up and relocated somewhere else, hopefully in La Mission.I would recommend this place to visitors, Priests/Rabbis, friends, and hungry folk. I'd recommend it to everyone, but I also know that everyone doesn't have $20.00 to spend on some sandwiches -- we're in a double recession!Tons of veg/vegan options, tastes great, overall good value. My only qualms are the wait time (but totally understandable, so that is why I neglect this in my 5-star rating), and it can be pricey (I will also over look this). I will stalk Ike like the creeper I am for another sandwich. My only regret was not buying two.
Please dont hate me. Don't burn me. Don't curse me. I was really looking forward to eating a delicious sandwich, but to me, it wasnt anything special. I'm sorry. I know the dirty sauce is supposed to be awesome and I was hoping for some good halal chicken but overall taste was bland. If it was the lettuce and tomato I added it probably masked the flavor I was hoping for. Please forgive me. I did not like these sandwiches. But I was very amused by the customer that wanted to order a sandwich with no bread, and picked at her sandwich with chopsticks.
If you've lived in the Bay Area for any considerable amount of time, you've probably heard of Ike's at some point. And chances are that whoever told you about Ike's probably talked about it like it was God's sandwich gift to mankind. And then you probably went, gave in to the peer pressure, and convinced yourself of the same thing. I know, I sound like a douche, but let me explain.Okay look, don't get me wrong -- Ike's is good. Really good. There is no denying that. Delicious and creative sandwiches, with really friendly workers, and it's a good time. But waiting in line for over an hour outside as the San Francisco cold bears down on you? Hell no. There's no way it's worth it. Maybe I'm just not a big enough sandwich guy, but I can't say that I fantasize about Ike's in my sleep like some of my friends do. I say you should go once because everyone says you have to. After that, sucker one of your friends to do the dirty work and get your sandwich for you.Now, all that said, you probably know by now that Ike's was kicked out of its last location, then recently found another place where they're currently only taking phone orders. So that more or less eliminates my biggest complaint about Ike's. And now this entire review is moot. The end.
To Ike's sauce hammer, every sandwich looks like a nail.I live in Ike's hood, and when I first moved here 2 years ago (before this place got yelped to death) I tried a sandwich that will be forever seared in my memory. It had fried mozzarella sticks in it. it was a grotesque experience.So, 2 years and 2200 reviews later, I built up the nerve to try this place again. 2500 yelpers and the new york times can't be wrong...right? Obviously, I took no chances and went with "Name of Girl I'm Dating."Same story. This sandwich is a total gutbomb, and dripping with sauces. It has honey mustard on it, which should have been a huge red flag. you'd have to be high and drunk off your *ss to enjoy this.Conclusion: Ike's sandwiches just aren't my style - big sloppy sandwiches are for middle america. I'm an elitist left coaster. If you are the type of person who thinks honey mustard is a legitimate salad dressing, then you will like Ike's. For the rest of us, well, there's the fra'mani salami at bi-rite or the grilled eggplant and humboldt fog sandwich at naked lunch.
Believe the hype, these sandwiches are awesome. I had the menage at trois, the chicken was quality, the cheese nice and melty, and the sauce had a delicious smokey flavor to it.If only I was in San Francisco a bit longer, so I could try they other varieties.
I thought I was in love with subway but clearly I've been blind for the past 3 yearsthank god my friends were in castro while I stayed in the dorms, napping away. comfortable, out of the cold and fog, NOT waiting in line at Ike's. they brought me home a kirk reuter sandwich on sourdough with everything on it minus the mayowhen I first opened the sandwich, it seems pretty flat -- a bit skimpy on the vegetables and this was a sandwich from the veggie menu! I was supadupa hungry so I said eh whateva and took a fat bite out of my sandwich from the legendary Ike's Sandwich spot. still feeling a little sleepy from my nap, my eyes opened up and I took the sandwich out of my mouth, stared at it and said "wtf? all that flavor came from this little thing?"it was the best sandwich I could ever expect from my crappy subway palette. that dirty secret sauce blew my mind. my sandwich came with a free bag of chips and a caramel apple lollipop (or was that just a treat from my friends?) I don't know, I don't care, all I know is that I am very sad that Ike's closed down but hey, they now do phone orders to pick around the corner from their old spot!
10 dollar thin sandwiches drowning in dressing for hipster douches.I think my new litmus for whether I read a person's reviews will be if they have given this place five stars.you might like this place:1) you think 10 dollars is a great price for a freaking sandwich. You probably also think 12 dollar burgers and 15 dollar individual pizza are great ways to save money when eating out in this recession.2) you think leggings are a perfect substitute for actual pants or a skirt.3) you pick place based on whether they have been featured many time on Food Network ( one girl in the line actually said that).4) you think drowning food in sauce makes it better.I had only heard about this place from the people who live in the neighborhood it's in who told me how rude the customers were and judging from the choice group I was in the two times I was there I agree. I felt 10 percent douchier just being there.while I was waiting for this amazing sandwich was the best thing ever there was not one but two conversations about who had waited the longest in line at Ike's. there is nothing hipsters like more than to show how much they will "suffer" to get something. 1 1/2 hours won by the way. Then there was the disbelief that some of us had never eaten there before, with the combo of "but it's been on Food Network and I've been coming here since before the pre-opening."why is so much of the review not about the sandwiches? well that's because they are pretty forgettable.I got a sandwich with salami and corned beef and smoked gouda none of which are subtle flavours but I couldn't taste them at all. In part that was because the smoked gouda was sliced the thinnest I've ever seen cheese sliced, the meat portions were tiny and finally instead of there being french dressing on top of it, it was swimming in it in addition to a cup of mayo or aoli. to top it off the only change I made was no pickles. Yup, there were pickles on it. Also it state that the sandwiches are warm. Yeah not really, more like slightly heated meat and not enough to heat anything else.Also disturbing was the black folks in front of me were given their food after me and were asked to give their menu to other people even though they weren't done with it. Like me, they were eating there for the first time and like me I doubt they will be back.the sandwich was crap. maybe the ingredients were fresh but I wouldn't know it due to overuse of sauce.
I've been coming here since 2009 ever since my friend introduced me to these AMAZING sandwiches. Every time I order I am never dissatisfied. Also it was a plus for me when I started the switch to becoming a vegetarian. I CAN STILL HAVE IKE'S?!?! AWWW YEEEEAAAAH~Their Veggie & Vegan Sandwiches are just as amazing. I also like how their staff is very informed on what is and isn't vegan. For vegans, they have a vegan option for the lollipop full sandwiches come with. mmmm blue raspberry blow-pop.Thanks Ike's for always pleasing my stomach! & those Dirty Chips are delish :)
What can I say? Ike's lives up to the Hype! This place is not your ordinary sandwich shop. With a wide range and variety of meaty goodness and vegan options, delicious sauces and spreads and some unique pairing of ingredients, there are options for everyone. What clearly sets this place apart is their Dirty Sauce. Essentially its a spicy garlicy aoli that gets baked onto the bread. It's certainly not cheap, but not too expensive. I mean they do have a sandwich over $20, buts in reality it's 4 sandwiches in 1 and is well worth it. This is of course, the Kryptonite, that was featured on Man vs. Food and comes fully loaded with every type of meet, onion rings, poppers and mozzarella sticks.Every sandwich is great and delicious, some not quite as hooked up as others, but overall this place rocks and you can't go wrong.
Best veggie sandwich I ever had! My bf even loved his vegan sandwich, and he's hella picky! Peace and love to Ike and the Ike's Place family. You rock my world:)-KetziaOakland, Ca
I agree with Anton. I think their reputation surpassed the quality sandwich they claim they're able to deliver. Don't take me wrong - I thought the customer service was decent, sandwiches tasted nice but I did not find it more flavorful than some good Vietnamese sandwiches (I know I may get stoned for this one). I think had this place not been so hyped up, I wouldn't have such high expectation, which would lead me to like this place more.
Ike's is the greatest...what else can be said?ps: I love the video game references...I had to order a 'Legend of Zelda' based solely on principle the first time I went. It was amazing of course...
With only five days left before the official eviction of Ike's on 16th Street, I had to get myself a taste of their legendary sandwiches. No, I don't want to taste the one in Redwood City. And no, I definitely don't want to wait for openings of their other locations. I don't know why (though I have theories), but often I find that the magic born from original locations are rarely replicated in its offspring. The verdict? Yummy, and very likely one of the better sandwiches in the city, but not likely worth standing for hours outside in the cold. We phoned in our order at 6:50 p.m., and were told to pick up at 8:00 p.m. When we arrived, we waited another 5-10 minutes in the pick-up line.It's important to eat Ike's sandwiches ASAP. One of their big draws, aside from the dirty sauce, is the freshly-baked-upon-ordering bread. If you don't eat that bread immediately, you will have missed out on one of the sandwiches' key features. We took ours home (15 minutes drive), and by then, 2 out of 4 of the sandwiches we ordered had soggy edges, which undoubtedly knocked the sandwiches down a notch.I'm not going to give a rundown of the sandwiches we tried and our comments on them. Feels unnecessary with 2000+ prior reviews. Actually, this entire review was unnecessary, but hey, I want to be part of the legend, too! Yep, this review was all for me.
This place never disappoints. Have tried a couple of their sandwiches and never had a bad bite. Helpful hint: Call in your order ahead of time.  At least 30-60 minutes ahead of time.
Amazingness. I'll leave it at that.
Love Ike's. They're fantastic with gluten free accommodations and delicious gluten free bread. Be sure to check out the "secret" menu online/on app for even more variety.
I bit into my MILF sandwich; halal chicken, jalapeno poppers, red hot sauce, ranch + all the veggies. I think my brain exploded from all the flavors. You taste every flavor in every bite and all you can do is shake your head from disbelief. The sandwich is fairly large and left me stuffed... yet wanting to try the rest of their options. I also ordered a Jim Rome to go which i ate a few hours later... this is definitely a sandwich that you should eat immediately because it wasn't so great later. I'm not going to knock you down for that Ike, you've revolutionized my sandwich perception.God I love MILFs.
I first heard of Ike's from an old friend who happened to go on a trip to SF when he was dating his future wife in L.A. They both agree that Ike's was the best sandwich place they had ever been. Also, it was not hard to miss the high 4-1/2 star average on yelp with over 4000 thousand total reviews. So after moving to SF recently, Ike's was towards to the top of my list of places to try. First off, I should mention that I'm a huge sandwich person. I'm a big fan of all types of sandwiches and this can probably be attributed to all the good sandwich places in Chicagoland (ie. Potbelly's, Which Wich, Snarf's, Halsted Deli). Anyways, I had huge hopes for this place, and Ike's did not disappoint. There is a good variety of unique sandwich options. I ordered the Matt Cain and my wife ordered the Hot Mama. Both toasted sandwiches on dutch crunch bread were excellent and almost as good as the best sandwiches I've had before, but I can't give them the prize of "Best All Time" in my book, but definitely for the west coast I can. My wife and I would rank Which Wich a 1/2 step above.  Although I would give their sandwiches 4 out of 5 stars, I give Ikes Place only 3, and here's why:1) Slow ordering from slow ordering process and too few employees. The wait from line to sandwich in hand at 2:30pm Saturday afternoon was about 40 minutes. I'd estimate that there were about 8 orders ahead of us. They had 3 cashiers, but only 1 or 2 of them seem to be full time for the line. The other one and a half were taking phone orders or multitasking with other things. As a result, I actually clocked about 3-5 minutes waiting time per order. However, my friend who ate with us argued that even if they took the orders faster, they food would not come out any faster as there were just as limited number of sandwich "crafters" in the back. Nevertheless, it's still a long wait for even one of the best sandwiches. If you go there and see a line out the door, it's not so much that there's a large number of people going there but more from the slow order speed. Very deceptive but I'm not claiming it's completely their fault. 2) There are no options for reasonable portions. . .only huge. For the fresh ingredients and quantity of food, the price is not bad at around $10-12 for most sandwiches. It includes your choice of chips and a caramel apple lollipop dessert. I can usually eat a large sandwich without effort, however I would have preferred the option of ordering just half a sandwich from here. Each sandwich is a bit too much for one person. Not a negative? Well, I don't think that they make very good leftovers. Sharing is highly recommended.3) It's cramped w/o any real seating. They have a waiting area with bench for up to 6 people and just as many chairs to sit and eat but no tables or eating surface which stinks if you don't live nearby. There is a park about 3 blocks away where you can picnic on a dry day, but Ike's sandwiches are toasted HOT and will only be lukewarm and a little soggy if you have to walk over to eat there. 4) If they had an option to add giardiniera, the sandwich would get 1/2 an extra star. Jalapenos are okay, but only add spice and not much flavor. I would've liked a little extra kick to my sandwich. I may be biased coming from a city where giardiniera is a given in any sandwich place including Subways.In conclusion, the sandwiches are highly recommended, but I can not be a regular customer here due to the reasons above. I may go only a couple times a year at most.
1st time at IKE'sWhen they say toasted, I want a crunch( not just some warmed bread roll) that i ate just minutes after I got my obvious to-go sandwich.I ordered the #26. A 12.00 dollar sandwich. You can read and read on how amazingly big this thing is but never have I read just how much phuckin shredded lettuce have they put in a sandwich as they did in mine. 1/2 the sandwich was lettuce. 5 bux of my money was shredded lettuce that I had to throw away because I wanted to taste what this dirty sauce was all about? as I suspected garlic spread.I can go on and on what my luke-warm, mostly filled lettuce 12 dollar sandwich is about but I will let the latter of the happy customers tell what they have encountered.I will give this shop one more chance and pick a different sandwich and make sure to advise the great customer service that I want very "light lettuce" next time.
HOLY CRAP NOW WHERE DO I GET MY LENINADE FIX?the dirty sauce ruined my menage a chicken? sandwich and my bf HATED it when we tried it on labor day, sorry ike you let us down, i came all the way from new york to line up at 3pm forever to try you. anyway the leninade makes up for it so thanks soda, thanksP.S. my best experience so far is at NAKED LUNCH by enrico's 504 Broadway. foie gras duck prosciutto sandwich is amazing.
Hands down, probably the best hot sandwich place I've ever tried in my life. I've been telling everyone around me about this place, but the only sad thing is that they're closed now? They're still looking for a place to move in SF. The wait was an hour and a half on a Sunday afternoon, but it was definitely worth it. I got the Manage-a-trois and dang, it was delicious. My mouth still salivates when I think about it. The sandwich just has so much flavor! I got a bite each of my friends' sandwiches of the Change and the Milf and they were all really amazing. i hope they open up soon because I'm definitely going back.
From reviews this place is one of the best rated sandwiches in SF... then I simply forgot all about it until my friend mentioned it months later. I took it as some sort of sign and gave it a try.The line was just as long to get into clubs on a Friday night! However, I decided to wait it out, which took about one and a half hours. To keep it short and simple... their sandwiches live up to their reputation, give them a try and you won't regret it. Judging purely on their taste and service along is enough for a 5 star review. I didn't care too much about the wait, since I was with good company, and I recommend you do the same ;D
Best sandwich I ever ate!!!!
Nomz...with a sad face =(Sadly this past weekend was my first time trying this place out. For the past two weeks my gf has been telling me that I have to come try this place out with her bc it's just THAT DAMN GOOD! Too bad they are being evicted because this is definitely one of the neighborhood gems around this area.I can possibly say this is by far the best sandwich shop in the city where as California Sourdough is the best sandwich shop in San Jose, yes they are that good too!I came here on a Saturday morning around 11am with my gf and to my surprise...there was a line already (shows you how awesome this place is)We stood in line for a good 15 min before we could order. This place is TINY SMALL. They take orders one at a time OUTSIDE of the shop because there just isn't any room inside. Once ordered, you can go inside choose the dirty chips you want and a drink if interested. On the side note, this place don't have your ordinary sodas...they have a wide selection of awesomeness in glass bottles. =) I ordered the Eli Manning with pesto sauce and my gf ordered the BackStabber with jalapenos and pesto sauce. As we were waiting outside, we saw another sandwich that we wanted to try out..the Manage tois. So knowing that we might not be able to come back to eat again, we got back in line and ordered another sandwich. After 15-20 min of waiting, we FINALLY GOT OUR DELICIOUS SANDWICH! and let me tell you....HOTTT DIGGITY DAMN!!! it's that GOOD! It was nice and toasty. The sauce they use is phenomenal! DIRTY SAUCE ALL THE WAY BABY! First bite took me back to a time when life was rough and was reminded that I can always stand back up and walk again...ANYWAYS go try it if you haven't yet! =D
Ok so the sandwiches here are good, but what's even better is their chips!! I got the salt and vinegar and bbq flavored ones that the dude at the counter suggested and it was seriously one of the best chips I've ever had!! He was telling me that people would get in line just to get there chips because it came from Louisiana and was only available there. Now I understand what he means. Got the spiffy tiffy sandwich and it was pretty good, but too big not that that's a bad thing. I couldn't finish and had to put the other half in the bag which ended up leaking because of the pesto which got a little messy. My friends and I also tried eating outside on these steps, but this lady came and told us to move because that wasn't their property or something. Next time I'll probably just take it togo and go to the park or something and eat it.
Spiffy Tiffy this time around. It was wonderful to say the least lolIkes = Best sandwhiches in San Francisco
Overrated. Period. Too expensive, and definitely not the best sandwiches I've ever had. The Funky Fusion chips are good, though. The Dutch Crunch bread is good. But this place is definitely overrated, especially with the wait. Maybe it was just because I had a chicken sandwich...Eli Manning and the 1/2 something.But I'll give it to them that everyone is very friendly.
Eli Manning, no mayo, dutch crunch, +mustard and jalapenos= DELISH. I prefer this over the popular Menage A Trois, which is still pretty darn good. The Halal chicken breast they use is SOO good: moist and tasty. Could be a less pricey though.Middle-aged bouncer dude outside of Lime/Ike's pick up line= JERK. Ruined my appetite due to his douche-baggery. Because of him, my sandwich got cold. The phone order people told me to come straight to the front, but this Neanderthal grunted at me and dogged me, and pointed to the back of the giant line, without even saying a word. If he wasn't 2 times my height, I would have b*tched him out for being so rude.
Simply the best sandwiches. Ever. Shutout to Taylor at the Castro location!! I take friends from out of town here every time they visit! My favorite sandwich? Nacho girl.
My wife and I live in Sacramento and Ike's is a MUST anytime we are in The City. I've tried 4 sandwiches off their menu and can't help but think someone has sold their soul..... or maybe a first born son to the devil in order for sandwiches to be this sinfully @!&!@ing GOOD!! Say it with me,"Food-Gasm." If you're a sandwich person don't deprive yourself. Go there TODAY. Noobies, stick with the dutch crunch until you're looking to switch up. * Don't forget to check the online menu. There are sandwiches there you won't find on the menu at Ike's Place.
I went into the city with the lady for just a day at Dolores Park... decided to get some food and I finally had an Ikes sandwich. the damon Bruce with cream cream added was so good I wanted another to take home with me. If your in the area they are so good. They also have branch off locations called Ikes Lair.
This place was beyond legit!! I couldn't wait to try this place out when I was in the Bay. It did not disappoint at all. I got here right when it opened and had one of the best sandwiches ever. I had half of a King Koopa and half of the Change, both of which were delicious. The bread was great too, I had the french bread on one and the dutch crunch on the other. I'm definitely going to come back to this place when in the area, I'd like to try one of each...
What more needs to be said about this place that hasn't already been said?All-time favorite sandwich shop hands-down. Their classic menage a trois is my personal favorite.Wait can and will definitely get long sometimes but you can call in to place an advance order for pick-up! Love how they include a bag of dirty potato chips and a caramel apple lollipop with each sandwich. Deee-lish!
I call Ike's the Kogi of SF, because both are the most overhyped overrated places I've ever eaten at, to the point of anger. I didn't even have to wait in a line because I went during off-hours, and I was still angered. I had the menage a trois sandwich, which is their famous specialty. It was essentially just a bunch of ingredients thrown together in mass quantities to form a sandwich, and it tasted like a mess. I almost never waste food, but with this I actually threw away almost half of it and then got a sandwich at the Safeway deli instead. That's how miserable this experience was for me.When I was there, a NY Times reporter was there also, and he didn't understand the hype either. It might be worth going to just to say you've been there, but it all depends on how much you value your time. But go before they get evicted.
Ordered their Menage a Trois sandwich and was blown away. The chicken wasn't dry, the bread was just right, and sauce was absolutely perfect. The sandwich costs about $11 and comes with chips. I wish we had an Ike's Place down in So Cal!!
Quick tip: Call-in your order so when you get there you can just pick up your order and go. I had the "nacho girl" that came with salmon, avocado, lettuce, cheese, and I thought mushrooms, but I didn't see or taste any. For a little less than fourteen bucks, my sandwich also came with jalapeno kettle chips, and a mojito flavored soda. A little steep for a sandwich, but it was a pretty big sandwich. The sandwich was good, but not mouth orgasmic. Initially, I only planned on giving Ike's three stars, but the past month I found myself craving sandwiches at every hour. Did they put crack in it or something?Anyway, I'm glad they're still open; at least for the time being. What should a pescee try next time?
I like Ike's for the delicious sandwiches, but just like other people I get really frustrated by their customer service.I have consistently gotten great sandwiches from there (I highly recommend the Dutch Crunch) - if you call and give them a few ingredients that you like (ham, avo, etc) they are usually able to suggest a sandwich since getting through their enormous menu is sometimes a challenge.With Ike's being at Lime for the time being, it has been a frustrating experience the two times that I have gone there.The ordering (if you haven't already done over the phone)/cash register area is right in the front of Lime and the sandwiches are now prepared somewhere that is out of sight (in the back). I always call ahead on the phone, so to start off it is frustrating to get there and have to wait in line again with people who haven't ordered yet to pay. The person at the register usually seems to alternate between phone orders and in-person orders. I was there yesterday after calling in my order which was supposed to be ready at a certain time. Totally frustrating to be told three times "your sandwiches will be right up" and to have to wait, wait, wait. Seems like there is a disconnect between the kitchen at the register/front area. I wish that they could be more accurate in telling you when food is ready and possibly allowing for payment online to avoid that whole wait.I believe that they are moving again, so I plan to try them again and am once again crossing my fingers. I used to visit them at their older location and while it was less chaotic than now it certainly wasn't stress-less.
The girl at the register was very friendly and knowledgeable... and patient w me. The sandwiches.. um, I need not say anything. done and done. go get one.
Ike's makes these amazingly large sandwiches with a twist. Let's just say I haven't found a sandwich that I didn't like yet.The line is a lot shorter these days since they moved to their new much larger location. If you're really hungry try your hands on the kryptonite.
HYPE, HYPE, AND MORE HYPE!!!! Ladies and Gentlemen....In case you didn't know, Ike's Place a bascially a sandiwch shop, a deli, or what some other yelper called it, a "glorified subway". No doubt, they makes some pretty good sandiwches, but are you effin kidding me. The attention and notoreity this place is/was (forgot it closed down) is ridonkulous!!!Ask yourself, would really want to wait over an hour for a sandwich. Yes, it's a good sandwich, filled with plenty of meat and your favorite fixings, but nothing extraordinary. When it all comes down it, it's just a piece of a bread, meat, seasonings, and some special sauce. IT'S JUST A GAH DAMN SANDWICH, CALM DOWN PEOPLE!!! I really wanted to love Ike's, i really did. When i heard about this place closing down, i knew immediately i had to make a pit stop and try out what everybody was talking about. So after I tried some sandiwches(i tried out 5 sandwiches from other peepz i came with, the mario, eli manning, some nacho sandiwch, and some other's i don't remember) they were all good. I was niether disappointed nor was amazed by these sandwiches. It was just a good sandwich, but definately not deserving of all the hype. 3 stars for Ike's! You're good, but you ain't all that and a bag a chips! Ok, maybe the chips are on the house, but you get what i'm saying.....
Ike is one badass mofo. Seriously. Not only does Ike's Place serve the best sandwiches in San Francisco, but he has the option of getting a sandwich on GLUTEN FREE bread! When you've gone most of your life eating gluten, and suddenly find out you're intolerant to it, going into a sandwich joint is like a pedophile walking past Chuck-E-Cheese. Anyway, we first stumbled upon Ike's when researching places to feature in our student documentary about being gluten-free. He agreed to let us film there, and we were presented with delicious gluten-free sandwiches (Name of the Girl I'm Dating=best sandwich EVER!), and a great interview from the man himself.Ever wonder what the secret is behind his infamous 'dirty sauce'? Check it out! vimeo.com/11476215
Food = 5 stars!Locations = 3.5 Stars...But you go there for the food, not the environment. They really need to expand, and although they may be closing down. I really do hope the get the right permits to continue running the sandwich shop. I luh luh LOVE this place! My cousin introduced me to this place, when he moved to Sacramento he would often come back to SF and stop by Ike's place. The sandwiches are to die for, the names of the sandwiches just says it all. The "dirty sauce" speaks for itself too. I definitely got to get me one of those tee shirts they have. ONE downside I might add about them is their workers, they aren't all as friendly as you think they would be. I guess its kind of expected because they deal with many customers on a daily basis. But they should MOSDEF be more polite to customers.
It was featured on Man vs. Food. So that means we had to stop and try it. We got really lucky and had no line. Really yummy sandwich, I got whatever they recommended.  Since this review is a few weeks late; the only thing I remember was that it was on the Dutch Crunch and it had fried chicken and it was REALLY GOOD. It was pricey for a sandwich but worth it.
I stumbled across Ike's Place on yelp & knew this was somewhere i wanted to try after seeing all the great reviews. When i finally had the opportunity to, I was thrilled to find that it was just across the street from where I grew up, which brought back alot of great childhood memories. Althouygh there was a bit of a wait, it was well worth it! I took everyone's advice & got the Dutch crunch. this was hand's down one of the best sammiches I ever had! my only recommendation would be to somehow reorganize the setting so ppl aren't waiting in line along the bathroom.
Delicious sandwiches!
Dear Yelp,Prices: RaisedQuality: Dipping.Wait Time: Still Long As Fuck.I understand supply and demand, but it still bugs me when places raise their prices for no reason other than because they can. If Ike were to improve some of the lesser qualities of his establishment, namely the hellacious wait, I would gladly pay the extra two bucks. As it stands though, the prices have been raised with no change in the wait, and the quality of the sandwiches has gone down due to the increased demand.Before Ike's, the SF sandwich scene was dominated by bodegas that charged 8 bucks for a sandwich you could make at home for half that price. Even with its flaws, Ike's Place is still far and away the best sandwich you can get in SF, but I think it could benefit from some healthy competition. Now that Ike's is facing eviction, I would hope that other "Ike minded" sandwich artists seize the opportunity to open up shop while the king is gone.I give Ike's Place a fantastic score of 3 out of 5 stars.Love,James
I have visited this establishment quite a few times and have tried different sandwiches, including the kryptonite, every single time as well. I will say that the combinations are definitely creative and the kryptonite is probably a job for two people, I find the flavors a bit jumbled overall. They use fresh ingredients to make the bread, but I prefer other sandwich establishments after having tried Ike's. I definitely recommend the place if you have never been, but whether or not you need to try every sandwich is probably unnecessary.
Ike's Place, you have stolen my heart. You have so many sandwiches to choose from meaty lovers to vegetarians to vegans! This place is definitely worth the wait. The sandwiches are a little under $9 except for the Superman sandwich which is $12 and that thing is HUGE! That thing can last you for 2 days. This place has the QUANTITY and the QUALITY.I ordered the "Name of the Girl I'm Dating" (chicken breast, honey mustard, avocado, pepper jack, and the works) on dutch crunch. It was so hot, toasty, and so so so good! Prepare to use loads of tissue papers , it can get a little messy. I ordered the boyfriend the Paul Reuben (sliced corned beef, homemade poppy seed coleslaw, french dressing and swiss) and he loved it!They also have their "dirty sauce" which is made with garlic and 19 different kinds of spices. Today they didn't have the beer battered onions rings but I really want to go back for that and try their other many sandwich selections. Ike's Place, I love thee!
This was my first time at Ikes after hearing rave reviews about the place. There's no room to sit but that doesn't keep the crowds away. I went on a Friday afternoon after Thanksgiving with a few friends for some yummy sandwiches to eat in Dolores Park on a beautiful sunny day. I split a Backstabber and one of the Baseball sandwiches that was listed on the wall with my friend.. both were really yummy- especially the baseball sandwich. The only thing lacking was lettuce. And now I'll tell you why I'm deducting one star:The girl who took our order said that they were out of lettuce.. fine, understood- even though that's kind of a key sandwich ingredient but I get that it happens. 5 minutes after I order and am sitting there waiting, I see a guy walk in with a cart full of lettuce. "Great" I think. "I'll just ask for it to be added to my sandwich seeing as I still have a 15 minute wait". WRONG. I went to the girl who took my order and asked if lettuce could be added to my sandwich and she quickly says "we're out" (even though the guy walked right past her). I pointed to the giant box of lettuce that was being wheeled in. She looks at it and turns back to me and says "Yeah, but it takes 20 minutes to chop it up". Um.. ok. Thanks for the great customer service biznatch. Since when did it take 20 minutes to peel off a leaf of lettuce? And even if it does, there are nicer ways to tell me you're being lazy and don't feel like walking to the back to ask for key ingredients to be added to a sandwich. Anyway, the food was a 5- service was 2.5 at best but to be fair, that girl seemed like the only bummer in house.
A friend recommended this place to me a few months ago so I finally made it in. They have an online menu apparently, which would have been nice to know ahead of time. They did not have any menus outside of "the essentials" for "the first timers" according to the gentlemen who took my order. He came off as condecending, but I understand the workings of the hospitality industry. He was not directly rude to me, but while waiting for my sandwich his conversation was overheard. But this review is for the food, not the customer service.I ordered the Mayoose''s CA-BLT on Dutch Crunch. This sandwich was fantastic. When tomatoes are in season I order BLTs frequently. It had Ike's Dirty Mayo which was a nicely seasoned mayonnaise. The bread was fantastic, the tomato, bacon, and avocado where spectacular. Hard to get excited about ice burg, but it is classic BLT and fit perfectly. One of the things I enjoy most about this place is Ike's San Francisco Pride. Pride in his town, in his state, in his team, and in his sandwich artistry. With sandwiches bearing the names of some popular Giant's Ball Players it is hard to pick which sandwich I will be getting this week. I plan on making Ike's the only place I get a sandwich from in the City. I can get off BART, order a sandwich online, and by the time I get there, the sandwich will be done, or close. Just from eating this sandwich I can tell the creator of these sandwiches has a passion for what he does.
Love their food here. Such a great selection of flavors.
Finally went there last month. It is as good as they say !
I'd heard the rumors. I'd seen the foodie TV specials. And with the over 2000+ yelp reviews on this place, my interest in trying Ike's one day was definitely peaked.However... I detest lines. In fact, I'd sooner have chandelier sex with a 72-year old Republican wearing a Mexican wrestling mask than voluntarily wait in a line for anything. But on Friday afternoon, in a state of hungover delirium, I did. I waited and waited and waited some more in the bright light of afternoon day, but holy hell was it worth it. This may be one of the best sammiches in the world. And if you know me, that is a SERIOUS statement!I went with the Jeries' BIG Meat Sandwich (of course, I mean, duh!) and it was a jam packed edible and mouthwatering creation of Roast Beef, Pastrami, Turkey, Ham, Salami and Jack, loaded with all the fixings and of course, their "Dirty Sauce." Oh to the my! It was pinch me on the ass, I'm dreaming, good! So good, that the fact that we had waited in a line was a far and distant memory once that sammich made friends with my mouth.But get this, you can call in your order and avoid the line. Had I bothered to research through some of the other reviews first, I would have realized this, but since I didn't and you might not have either, I'm tellin' ya here! And so, make a mental note, this place is worth it. Mind-blowingly awesome sammiches that have me sitting in front of my laptop now wishing I had a hot one all over my hands right now! YUMMM!
After all the rage about this place, my partner and I finally decided to try it. We liked what we had SO much that we got it again the next day! But by the second day we learned to call in the order and then run in and pick it up- much more efficient than waiting in line to order and then waiting for your sandwich. We like the Chester Cheetah with avocado and all the goodies. MMMMMMMMMM
I freaking love their sandwiches. So delicious and greasy. No one can quite make a sandwich quite like Ike's.But I freaking HATE their lines. We all hate it so much but find ourselves lined up for it. 'Nuff said.
Walked over here after chilling at Dolores Park to grab a bite. I heard bout the lines for this place but thankfully, there was none when i got there. The guy behind the register was super helpful with giving suggestions. I got the Elvis which was BOMB Diggity- GOOD! ;)
I was thrilled to try Ike's. I can't eat gluten, and it sucks. But Ike's has gluten free bread! I ordered my sandwich and took it to the park to eat. I was surprised to see it was on a long roll. Gluten free bread usually is small or in slices. This should've been my first hint that something was off. Maybe Ike's had done the impossible and made normal sized gluten free bread! I think hunger was taking over all reasoning skills. The bread was delicious! Gluten free bread, even the best of it, doesn't taste like "real" bread. This should've been my second hint, and it's my own fault for continuing to eat it. But, the bread I was given was definitely NOT gluten free. I'll spare you the details, but I paid the price for not listening to my gut. I'm not sure where the lines of communication got crossed. My dining partner confirmed that I did indeed order gluten free bread. I read so many good reviews about how concerned and careful they are with food prep for the gluten free plagued folks. I wish I had received the same consideration. I've never had this happen before when dining out (luckily!) and unfortunately it happened here.
seriously most bomb sandies ever. too good to be true. not worth visiting if you're looking for a healthy option though.
A great quality sandwich! But seriously, this place isn't all that GREAT! It's too hyped up.I ordered the "Backstabber", it was pretty good, but I thought this place was going to BLOW my mind, but it didn't... Cute and interesting names.. though
Dear Ike. Thank You for creating a sandwich which is out of this world. I have had many a sandwich in my lifetime, but yours is by far the best. Honestly, there is a sandwich for everyone here. Oh and people complaining about the wait ...I flew from Boston Ma to CA, last September, just to try one of these amazing sandwiches...on the last day they were in their original location...if I had an Ikes near my house I would line up every single day to pick up one of these heavenly treats. IKE you are awesome. thank you for taking the time out to meet us and autograph on the hats. FREE IKE.
First of all, I'm from back east - a recent transplant from New England where great sandwich places abound...and I've got to say, Ike's is a world class joint. IMO, the key to their sandwiches is not just their great bread selection and the hearty fillings, nor their killer selection for vegies, vegans and carnivores alike - it's the ratio of bread to fillings to the sauces. Not too dry or wet and the sauce is always evenly spread. Both their hot and cold sandwiches hit the spot depending on your mood. Bravo Ike!
Awesome sandwiches. Crazy variety. Insane wait times. Ike's place is awesome. They have what seems like a million sandwiches on their menu, as well as another million that aren't. If you check out their menu online or pictures here on yelp, there is bound to be something to make your mouth water, no matter what you like. They offer plenty of vegetarian and vegan options too.Ive gotten sandwiches here a few times, and have never been disappointed. My favorite so far is the King Koopa, (All Beef Meatballs, Mozzarella Sticks, Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers, Marinara). Its crazy how much gets stuffed into these things. My only issue with Ike's is the wait. Parking is nonexistant, and you have to call in phone orders HOURS ahead of time. I called in at 11:45 once while at work to have sandwiches ready for pickup after 3:30. Fortunately, it's worth the wait. I will be back. And now that I think about it, I'm overdue for a visit.
the best sandwiches ever!!! i had name of the girl i'm dating on french roll and it was BOMB
Great sandwiches. Great selection! If you are a sandwich freaker like me, this place is just fun. However, the great sandwiches here aren't worth a 45 minute wait. They just aren't. There are many places around down that serve sandwiches that are as good or better than anything I've ever had at Ike's. I hope that one day there are 4 Ike's around SF and that Ike and his staff are happy, well paid, and fulfilled in their vocation. However, until I don't have to stand around for an hour for a sandwich, I probably won't be patronizing this place.
My friends been talking about this, giving it high reviews but after tasting the actual sandwich i couldn't figure out why they liked it so much cause ike's place is simply a sandwich shop hype.The wait is ridiculously long, and the sandwiches aren't memorable. There is no such thing as inside seating because customers aren't even allowed in the store. the cash register is located outside right in front of the door. so when it's freezing cold, be prepared with a warm jacket! The sandwiches isn't bad but it's not the greatest. I prefer little luccas even though it's out of the way. When my boyfriend and i finally got our sandwiches it got soggy before we got to the car. Yea, the sandwiches are big, but i didn't pay for a soggy sandwich that looked like it's been sitting on the counter for a while.
Obviously. If you are looking for a big, tasty, messy tube of deliciousness, Ike's is the way to go. Voodoo chips are a must.
Ike's is more than destination; Ike's is a way of sustaining life! These sandwiches are creative, delicious, and a bolded bullet point in the definition of San Francisco's unique culinary culture. No offense, but I hope Ike's neighbors live the rest of their lives as grumpy, sexless outsiders.
We came here for lunch, I had the #18 or the Matt Cain which consisted of roast beef, turkey and salami with provolone and their house sauce on a dutch crunch. The sandwich was tasty and warm. I will try other options one day.
Great place. No matter how much this place goes through it will always have a special place in my heart. IKES!
A painfully long wait for a mediocre, overthetop sandwich with a dumb name? As yelp says, "methinks not!" complaints - 1. having to read the description of sandwiches to figure out what i'm ordering takes too much. what ever happened to just naming something on it...like chicken, turkey, meatloaf, etc.2. when you pile on the ingedients, you loose good flavor and gain undistinguishable mass of greasy toppings.3. ikes place proves that san franciscans will stand in line for anything you tell them is "awesome" or anything that is on a "list." if i wanted to wait 30 min for a sandwich, i can go to a restaurant where i can at least sit down with a drink.
I've been prolonging the update to my review in fear of getting stoned because of the huge following... I can't hang with the wait! What is up with 3 hour wait times for a freaking sandwich?!? While I appreciate the variety, I'd love it if they could whittle down their menu to... oh maybe 30 sandwiches instead of 200, just for efficiency's sake... While I appreciate their ability to set expectations on wait-time up front, what I hate is when I comply with their 3 hour lag just to show up to find that they still haven't made my goddam sandwich.I'm out, I can't hang. Guess I'm just not cool anymore... But at least I'm not starving! Consider your future wait shorter by one-person.
***Update 03/10/2014***I've been back to Ike's a few times since my last review, and I must say they redeemed themselves. The sandwiches are all so tasty (when they have all the ingredients, lol), and taking the sandwiches to Dolores Park makes for a really great meal. :)Updating my review to 5 stars!***Original Review from 2011***Atmosphere: 3 stars. It was so packed inside and there was no indoor dining area. There was a small area to sit along the window, but not much else. It was also the afternoon of the Bay to Breakers race, so maybe that's why it was so packed even in the afternoon past the lunch rush.Food: 4 stars. I got the Name of the Girl I'm Dating, because my sister told me the halal chicken is amazing. Unfortunately, they ran out of chicken and only had fried chicken (extra $) or turkey, etc. On top of that, they didn't have Dutch Crunch bread either. So, I got it with turkey on wheat bread. It tasted great, but I wish I could've tried the chicken--I guess it's a reason to go back and try it another time! It was pretty messy, though, so I'd get lots of napkins! My sister got the Menage  Trois with fried chicken (again, out of the halal chicken). It was also great, but very messy. I also liked that they had a ton of selections on their menus (yes, plural--meat, veggies, gluten-free, vegan)!!Service: 3.5 stars. The wait wasn't too bad, considering how many people were in the place. We also found space to sit, so we munched on our chips and got cups of water while we waited.Price: 3 stars. The sandwiches are pretty pricey, but the quality is pretty worth it.Overall: 3.5 stars. I would definitely go back and try the halal chicken on dutch crunch!
Okay, I'm kind of getting bored by the fact that my pages are flooded with 5 star reviews from my West Coast trip, but seriously. When I'm on holiday, I ain't going to eat bad, am I. It cometh from mine own pocket, this moolah. And Ike's sandwiches are the only sandwiches in the world I'd pay $15 for, BECAUSE THEY ARE WORTH IT.I was determined to drag my sandwich-loving fianc here and having walked miles to get here last year, on a drizzly miserable day in San Francisco this time around we took the bus. Yes, taking the bus to get a sandwich. Mental. But remember, WORTH IT. He was excited. I was excited. Our minds were positively blown by the range of options open to us, especially with me being able to eat everything on the menu now. I relied upon his snap decision making (one of the reasons I'm marrying him) and let him choose the two sandwiches to share, which were the Menage A Trois (lovingly labelled the 3 Way when you receive it in its paper) and the Damon Bruce. The 3 Way consisted of BBQ sauce, honey mustard, actual honey, pepper jack cheese, swiss cheese, cheddar and chicken, and just to finish ourselves off we added jalapeo poppers. When in Rome. The Damon Bruce contained beer battered onion rings, steak sauce, provolone cheese, and... thinly sliced rib eye. My GOD.The meat on both sammies was tender and juicy. I can't remember which one we got on sourdough and which on Dutch crunch, but the freshness of the breads was palpable too. We ate our spoils there and then on the seats provided - there are only a few but if it's chucking it down and you haven't a car, it's a great way to cosy up within the hectic atmosphere of this awesome sandwich shop. Everything on each sandwich was just too sexy and even though I was full, I didn't want either of my halves to end. It's a good job I don't live near here.But that didn't stop me being jealous of Kat F, whom we bumped into on the bus back. She was just about to head to Ike's and said her place wasn't far from there! I went positively green for my colleague. Imagine having all that yum on tap. Okay, I'd have to ration my visits, else I'd be broke. But still. Jeal.Incidentally, the dirty chips are ACES!
3/5 stars on the Wing Scale... - Quality of product: 2 of 3 stars - Quality of service: 1 of 1 star- General feelings of happiness: 0 of 1 star Six of us (4 guys and 2 girls) split 4 sandwiches: the Mills Vikings and the Superman Challenge (Doomsday, Lex Luthor and Kryptonite).I didn't think the sandwiches were especially delicious, nor did the dirty sauce blow my mind. If anything the crazy variety of meats and veggies created a mess and made the meal hard to enjoy. If I had to choose a favorite from the Superman trio, it'd be the Lex Luthor. I like the cheesesticks in there. Funny thing: about a quarter into the Doomsday (with habanero salsa), one of our friends turned bright pink and began to sweat for about an hour!! We've never seen a sandwich do THAT before.I'd recommend phoning your orders in ahead of time if possible... we were able to pick-up quickly with zero wait. We also happened upon Happy Hour by accident and got free drinks! As others have mentioned, the prices are a little high for some sandwiches but their giant portions make up for it. I'd go here for novelty but honestly, I'm just not that into Ike's.
An hour to receive your sammich?Shut your pie hole... it'll be satisfied. I'd sworn off brunch at Lime forever due to the douchebag/skank quotient... but Ike's sandwiches brought me back.  It's still douchebaggy & skanky... but damn, that's a fine sammich. Worth the ordeal.
I`m not complaining that I had a bad sandwich, it`s just was not THAT special .It was a good sandwich not 2 hr wait good though. Just like another reviewer said "there sandwiches are -dirty sauced to death" , other than that they are not that special, and there is so much dirty sauce you can eat before your sick of it. Fat makes anything taste good.  You can make your own dirty sauce(which is mayo based) and bake it on the bread in your broiler at home and practically have the same deli sandwich.
I've live in San Francisco all my life and I never tried Ike's til a few days ago and I'm very glad I did. After hearing about this place from a lot of my hometown friends while I was away at school in San Diego, I really wanted to come back to SF and try an Ike's sandwich. We got to Ike's a little after 2pm on a Thursday. The line was long, but tolerable. Maybe standing in line with a bunch of friends made the wait seem shorter than it was. Anyway, I ordered the Eli Manning, actually a few of us did, and it was delicious. Btw, the sandwiches come with a bag of chips and a caramel apple lollipop. The sandwiches are priced fairly for its taste and size. For some reason my sandwich was very messy or maybe I just suck at eating sandwiches. The Eli Manning was a sandwich of chicken, cheese, avocado, mushroom, and a few tasty sauces. Everything blended together nicely and I was left wanting more after each bite-- I finished the entire sandwich in one sitting. I definitely was full afterward. I love sandwiches and I would come back here again to try all the other amazing sandwiches-- wallet permitting, of course.
It's safe to say that I like Ike! Now boys and girls, I made a few crucial mistakes with my visit to Ikes that could have potentially ruined my sandwich experience. I offer you advice so you do not make the same mistakes.I walked up to Ikes at 12pm and Yikes! The line was out the door by at least 30 people. I knew I didn't have time to wait so I asked one of their cute employees if they could take a to go order for 2 and a half hours from now (when I would be finished volunteering for the afternoon). Of course, because I only had one sandwich, they were able to accommodate me. Crisis averted.Lesson 1: phone in your order ahead of time, and give them at least two hours notice.After he told me I would be able to pick up my sandwich after my volunteer work was done, he then asked what I wanted.Me: "Um..."Yeah, wrong answer. Lesson 2: study the menu online before even attempting to order.He asked if I liked chicken and recommended the Menage a Trois as one of their most popular sandwiches: chicken, 3 kinds of sauces (honey, honey mustard and bbq) and 3 kinds of cheese (swiss, pepperjack and gouda) with lettuce, tomatoes, peppers etc on dutch crunch.Two and a half hours later, I return to pick up my sandwich. I even got a free bag of chips for some reason, but I'm not complaining. "Fantastic" I thought. "Now it's off to catch the N toward the park"Yeah, that's another wrong answer. The thing I discovered about Ikes sandwiches is they don't travel well. They might make it to Dolores Park or Duboce park, but they won't do well going much farther than that.Lesson 3: Plan your lunch location accordingly, ideally within a 3 block radius of Ikes.I got to the park and had a very soggy sandwich due to all the sauces. This was not Ikes fault, not the sandwiches fault, not even my fault. It was merely happenstance and the fact that I really wanted to have lunch at Stow lake and then go for a walk to the beach. Nevertheless, the flavors were spot on, the structural integrity of the sandwich remained intact and I really did love the dirty sauce, whatever that is. It just made for a messy sandwich experience.So for a short recap, here are the lessons learned for optimizing the pleasure in your sandwich experience.1. Phone in your order ahead.2. Study the menu ahead of time.3. Plan to eat lunch close to the shop.And your most important lesson...4. Bring extra napkins (because if college taught you nothing else, it's that a Menage a Trois is always messy...)
Honestly, I keep switching back and forth between Ike's and The Sentinel for best sandwich in SF. They each have their highlights. Ike's has the dirty sauce, dutch crunch, and infinite combinations. Sentinel has buttery soft rolls and succulent meat. But if I'm going to if I'm going to have one desert island sandwich to eat over and over again until I'm rescued or assimilated into a native tribe it would have to be the Pizzle at Ike's. The way I can tell is when I haven't had one in a few weeks and I take that first bite. Everything comes back into focus and the fiery romance is reignited. It's just such a perfect combination of meats, bread, dressing, and veggies.I know it's overhyped and there can be long lines. But, to me, it's remained unpretentious and I feel very comfortable going there again and again (and again).
If you're visiting San Francisco, you MUST visit Ike's for lunch. Great sandwiches in the heart of the City. I recommend the Matt Cain. But seriously, all the sandwiches are good. There are a lot of vegan and vegetarian options for those with dietary restrictions. Some times the manager will come out to entertain us. I remember one day the manager came out handing out lollipops for answering trivia questions. There are long lines during lunch time, so not recommended if you want a quick bite.
hard to really say anything helpful when this has been reviewed so much...sandwiches are THE BOMB. I go for just bacon and chicken on sourdough (with dirty sauce of course), keeping it simple. so toasty and happy.they also have a great selections of drinks and chips!
Went here on the way out of San Francisco on a Friday afternoon. We called ahead and put our orders in, and the person taking the order couldn't have been more nice and accomodating. We parked on the street and walked up to the shop to get our sandwiches. Seeing how busy the place was, I couldn't believe they were so calm on the phone taking the order!I ordered the Menage a Trois (halal chicken, honey, honey mustard, bbq sauce, pepper jack, cheddar, and swiss), and my girlfriend ordered a custom sandwich (which the lady behind the counter dubbed "chicken unoriginal") with chicken and avocado. My sandwich was perfect with the sauces making the chicken moist. We both got wheat rolls which were very moist and flavorful. Overall, I can understand why this place gets such great reviews. Ease of service, accomodating, and great food. Great to see a place that hasn't deteriorated after gathering national fame!
The sandwiches here are pretty good but they're so expensive! I came here and ordered the M.I.L.F. for the bf and the Menage a trois for myself, both on dutch crunch. The M.I.L.F. was pretty good. The Franks Red Hot sauce it comes with was a bit overpowering though. I couldn't eat more of it after a few bites. The Menage a trois is definitely the winner between the two. You could taste all the ingredients, all of which were deee-lish. The dutch crunch is definitely a must as everyone else has said.Overall, this place is okay. I paid about $20ish for two sandwiches, which came with two bags of chips. Yikes! We ordered to-go, but from the 1-2 minutes we were inside, the servers were very friendly. Their temporary location at Lime is pretty hard to find, especially if you're not from the area. There's no jumbo sign outside like their previous location. We found that it was only two stores down from Peet's Coffee, so just park around there and you'll be fine.
Ike's has to be the place to go if you are in the San Francisco area. Not only do they have a vast selection of sandwiches from which to choose from, but they also have the option for you to make your own sandwich. On top of having that option there is a vast array of vegetarian and vegan sandwiches for the non-meat/non-aminal eating population. I love that when I go there I can pick something that I know and love, the vegetarian love triangle, or be completely adventurous and try something new.I also love the fact that you can make your sandwich as big and full as you want. Every time I walk into Ike's I have to get my sandwich extra dirty, everyone should unless you are a vegan, this means that you will get mozzarella sticks and onion rings added to your sandwich. Over all this is one of the best eateries there is in town. I make the trip at least once a month just to eat there and if I happen to be passing by the city I don't hesitate to stop and buy a great sandwich.
Seriously the best sandwich you can ever have. I'm a big deli fan and pretty critical when stuff like old bread, lackluster condiments, and blah-processed meats are in your sando and Ike's is no joke - the Everest of Sandwich making.Def get the dirty sauce, def get anything with the Halal chicken breast and def make sure you're ready for the best food coma of your life after.Bring lots of friends.
I am from Jersey, the land of the fat sandwiches, and I am accustomed to the gluttonous monstrosities that people call subs. So, after seeing this joint on Man Vs. Food, I knew that my husband and I had to venture there on our upcoming honeymoon.We arrived and waited on line for a good hour before ordering. The staff there was really nice and helpful and many of the people on the line were nice as well.Positives:1. The dirty sauce is fantastic.2. The Lex Luther is filled with meat, meat, and more meaty goodness.3. The Lex Luther can feed two.4. They serve Dirty chips. Jalapeno is my favorite.5. They freshly bake all of their own bread.Negatives:1. The Lex Luther, while fantastic, is not worth the hour plus wait.2. The MILF sandwich was nasty. The shredded chicken on it was mushy and all of the components together made me gag. So, my husband and I shared the ridiculously large Lex Luther. 3. No seats! We went to the park to eat (which is half a mile away) and by that time the dirty sauce had already seeped into the sandwich and wasn't as distinct anymore!All in all, I really think Ike's is worth a 3.5, but I'll round up because my bag had Sexy Lexy written on it and it had the right personal touch! On a strange note, why does a sandwich place close at 9? In New Jersey, places that serve fat sandwiches are open until at least 1 in the morning.
When my boyfriend and I are feeling a bit naughty, we come to Ike's. YES it is unhealthy and YES it is the best sandwich I have ever had in my life. If I am pretending to be healthier, I order a vegan sandwich. Gluten free please. The lines can get pretty insane but it is so worth it. Don't expect a classy eating experience. The best you will get is a chair and your lap to scarf your yummalicious sandwich down. They offer halal meat.... they are fantastic.
over rated
are they good sandwiches? yeahworth the wait?nowould i go back? depends...I was visting SF for the weekend and had seen Ike's on Man vs Food so decided to try it. I waited until after lunch rush because many of the yelp reviews talked about long lines... so went in around 3-330.maybe the 30+ minute wait set my expectations way too high, but by the time i got my order, found a place to eat (which ended up being on a stoop across the street) & took a bite, I was unimpressed. Yes, it was good but not worth the hassle. If you're around and there's not a big line, give it a try! Otherwise, i say skip it.
Hands down the best sammich place I've ever eaten. My favorite is the SF Giants - turkey, bacon, mushrooms, avocado, swiss on French Bread. To quote Stewie from Family Guy - it's like an orgasm in my mouth. :DIMO, I enjoy the sandwich a whole lot more when I call the order ahead rather than wait in the ridiculous line that forms outside. Yes it's a great sandwich but I would not subject myself to the long wait of the line ever again (like I did the first time I went). I don't care for the price increase because I don't get Ike's that often as I live in Cupertino.
Pretty much everyone who has given this place a positive review is right! I came here while visiting SF with my chica and waited about a half hour to order and another half hour for the food. Typically I hate waiting, but the people working here kept coming out and talking to the crowd. Even Ike was doing crowd control for a bit. That kept us from being bored. My only complaint is that they have no fries and nowhere to sit. If you are an out of towner visiting ike's for the first time, be ready to grab a bench or park your booty on the curb so you can chow down on these awesome 'wiches!
I'm giving it three stars. It would get 5 for amazing sandwiches and service but I have to downgrade for:1. Two hour long lines during the weekend. Come on kids, it's a sandwich not "Pirates of the Caribbean". 2. For harassing disabled people on fixed incomes in rent controlled housing. There are at least two empty businesses in the same area you could move to. With just under $900,000 in gross receipts you are better able to move and with such a crowd control issue it's obvious you need a bigger place.
OOOOOOMG.... SO.... SO... SOOO GOOOOD!!!! ^.^ =D =)))Long wait, but well worth it. Tried 3 things: Hollywood SF Cheesesteak, Name of the Girl I'm Dating, Legend of Zelda.OOOOMGGG.. ALL 3 WERE DELICIOUS AHHH!! Got them all on the Dutch Crunch bread. Dirty sauce .. mmm. I read through the many reviews while waiting in the long line, thanks yelpers! =) Lived up to the hype fsure.
*Don't forget to ask about the "Secret Sauce" and add-on's Otherwise, my last visit to Ike's was my first, and NOT MY LAST! They have about a dozen choices for the sandwich lover in everyone. My Sandwich, The Damon Bruce. It's a meat-lovers delight! I'm not a fan of A-1 sauce either but it worked when it came to this sandwich. It featured thinly sliced rib-eye, provolone cheese, and onion rings. It even attracted the dogs at Alamo Square in SF! Ike's is in the friendly Castro District of San Francisco, although it may be in the $$ range, you get your money's worth!
No one should EVER, and I mean EVER, have to pay $9 for a sandwich. That's obscene and for that, minus one star.Other complaints: nowhere to sit. It's a tiny sandwich shop, sure, but there's no seating inside and you have to bank on a nice day to score one of two or three tables outside. All of that out of the way: THIS SANDWICH IS BOMB, YO. As a vegan, I get to make ANY of their sandwiches vegan....and they even have fake cheese! (And hell, man, what cheese is that? It's so freakin' good.) This sandwich is quite different from Love'N'Haight. Here, it's like sliced deli meat. There, it's like baked patties of "meat." And Love'N'Haight lacks "cheese."Vegans around town KNOW about this place, and they know about it for a reason. If you were to hand a meat-eater one of these vegan gut-bombs, they wouldn't know it was fake. Truth. These suckers are doing something right. They have a good formula for tasty bits.Every vegan in the city should go. At least once. You'll feel like you just drank a carton of oil, but it's so worth it.Sadly, I can't budget $9 for a sandwich, so I don't really get to come here with any sort of frequency, even though it's relatively close to mi casa. Ike, lower the prices, yo. Love'N'Haight is taking your "el cheapo" biz.
a couple of years ago, there was a fast food burger ad that had one burger muncher asking the other cheese burger muncher if he was gonna eat his cheese paper. WTH? what is cheese paper? it is the paper that you wrap the burger/sandwich around and the cheese from the burger has melted onto the paper. but it's soooo good you have to eat the cheese off the paper too. i ordered the Menage a Trois sandwich here--Halal Chicken Breast, Real Honey, Honey Mustard, BBQ, PepperJack, Swiss, Smoked Goudathe a trois referring to the three cheeses.i found myself eating the cheese paper too dripping in bbq, honey, and dirty sauce.wow! this sandwich was huge and tasty.slathered in bbq sauce AND dirty sauce (ike's house made garlic aioli sauce) and served toasted.if you do not order ahead, plan to wait a hella long time.i phoned in my order from Oakland and 55 minutes later, i still had to wait for it.was it worth the wait?an emphatic YES.everything worked out just right.i found parking right in front. so i ate the toasted menage a trois as soon as i got it in my car.oh yeah!JYW is a fan!
After Man vs Food, I wanted to see what all the hype was about. I checked out their menu online, and with all of the options, I felt this would be a can't fail sandwich shop, but I was wrong. My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday, around 2p.m., thinking we had successfully waited for the lunch bunch to pass... WRONG. The line was SO long, but we decided to wait it out... a line this long had to be worth it, right? After waiting a whopping 1.5 hours to order, we finally got to the front where unfortunately, they had already run out of turkey. That wasn't a huge biggie, so we substituted chicken breast instead. The next bummer was that we had to wait ANOTHER 20ish minutes for our sandwiches to be made. A total of approximately 2 hours later, the sandwiches were in our hand... only to find out that we had been jipped of some of our stuffings! From my sandwich - the avocado and tomatoes were missing! From my boyfriend's sandwich - no jalapeno poppers (which we paid extra for!) GRRRRRR It was not worth it to go back and make a stink, so we ate our meh sandwiches without said condiments. Overall, I was disappointed. Next time I want a sandwich, I'm either calling my order in or making it myself. Sorry Ike's you just didn't impress me...
After I ate my sandwich, I walked the mandatory 80 miles necessary to work off the amazing amount of calories from eating my sandwich today. It was beyond worth it. We arrived at Ike's on a sunny Sunday morning at about 11:45. The line was not long but not too short. The wait was about 5 minutes, but it gave my friend and I time to look at the menu and continue to hem and haw over the choices. She decided (finally) on the Cristina and Umair go to Ike's Place and I... the Super Mario. Come on... who the heck can turn down a sandwich with Mozzarella sticks inside?!?The shop itself is small. The day was lovely, so there was a cashier outside to take your order. She was helpful, friendly and reassuring that our order wouldn't take long. It didn't. In fact, Ike (THE Ike) came out and called my name for our sandwich order. He told me that the Super Mario was his 2nd favorite sandwich. What is his favorite?..... The Paul Ruebens! The sandwiches my friend and I had were delicious. They were huge and tasty! I was busy stuffing my face and getting down in my sandwich :) As a tip, you can order your sandwiches to go and bypass the line! This is definitely what we'll do when we return! I like Ike's!!! :D
Oh Ike's, why must you be some tempting? Your meat is so tantalizing between those buns of yours. I love it when you're extra dirty, especially on a dutch crunch roll. My knees are getting weak thinking about you.You've always treated me well, I somehow catch you when you're not busy. It must be a calling. We shall meet again.Menage a Trois with Eli Manning? Or maybe I'll try Jim Rome next time. They all look so irresistible. It's like an orgasm in your mouth, with a lollipop to go along with at the end. :)
I love this place. I love it so much, in fact, that I planned a weekend around picking up a sandwich here.It's always interesting to go out with vegetarian and meat eating friends at the same time. Ike's is one of those places that easily accommodates both and where everyone is incredibly happy.I don't even remember what the name of my order was because the order names were so weird (think "ex-boyfriend," "(Name of girl I used to go out with,)" "Hot Mamma Huda," "We're JUST Friends," or "Fat Bastard") that all I can remember is that mine had chicken in it and cost between $7 and $8. And they give you a blow pop that is guaranteed to turn your tongue green or blue or whatever colour the blow pop is.The place is tiny. Only 2 tables inside and 2 outside that fill up quick. Long story short, Ike's is probably the best sandwich shop in the city and I can't wait to go back!
OH MY GOODNESS, THIS PLACE IS GREAT!!!!My husband and I stopped here after seeing it on Man VS Food. Can't say I like the location, we felt our rental would get broken into and all sorts of undesirables lurking around.Ok now for the food!I got the Going Home For Thanksgiving sandwich, which included Dutch crunch bread, (always get the dutch crunch bread) Turkey, Cranberry Sauce, havarti cheese, and sirracha, and the dirty sauce, (always get the dirty sauce)----Cannot describe how wonderful this sandwich is!!! I crave it and me living in Long Beach, that does not help :(I believe my husband got the Jim Rome- Turkey, red pesto, cheddar, and avocado that was great too.I want to try all the sammies there, but Home For Thanksgiving is so good I want it again.My husband and I came back up to San Fran a few moths later driving through on our Anniversary road trip, by the time we got there, it was closed.As we drove by with a tear in our eye, We can honestly say this is the best. :)
Ike=short, bold, cute! :-) Ike's Place= best F$%^ sandwich on earth!! Ike serves your food himself, so cool! you get a lolly pop too! I can't say anything more that what everyone else has said!! the best sandwich, so cheap. BTW give salads the try too, they are big and full of veggies. The only advise, read the menu on line, and decide what you want, because you won't have time to read all those pages standing in line. Another thing, they don't serve french fries or onion rings during weekends, so get there weekdays if you really want them. I love love love the sandwich.
Okay, let's be real, this is a good sandwich place. There are others though (I definitely pay mad respect to Roxie's) but the reason I have to give Ike's the 5 stars - their RIDICULOUSLY huge selection of veggie and vegan sandwiches. I'm a veggietenarian (I love animals so I don't eat them and I would love to have been a vet but thank goodness my BFF is one so that's taken care of)! I digress, per usual. It's one of those small, literally, hole in the wall spots I'm proud to say started in SF. I mean, with Ike's opening up in other locations, it's nice to know it all started on 16th street in the City. In any case, I should probably talk about the sandwich I had, eh? I had the Green Goblin (Fake Turkey meat, avocado, BBQ sauce) on a dutch crunch roll with dirty sauce. It was rather yummy. Truth be told, I didn't really want to like this place because there were so many people outside (like, all the time, yo!) and I was thinking to myself, "It can't be that good of a sandwich place? Or, can a sandwich be that good?" Hmmmm. Admittedly, I wouldn't stand in line (no way). Rather, I would call in and make sure you don't eat anything (because the sandwich will fill you up) and meet your pick up time. Overall, if you follow those two simple things, you're golden. I will say this though, I'm not only giving Ike's 5 stars for making good sandwiches, I'm giving them the 5 stars (more so) because Ike really thought about the veggie/vegan loving folks in the Bay Area. Thanks, Ike. You're loved by sandwich lovers (meat or no meat...there is no question)...your sandwiches really are for everyone!
I can't sing enough praise about this place. The sandwiches are delicious and the people who work here are always really nice. I could eat here every day for the remainer of the year and still have something new to eat every day.
definitely due for an sf excursion, my friends and i decided to try ike's, given that none of us have ever been there, and, well, we were hungry :P what's the first thing you notice when you're there? THE LINE. jebus, it was long. in the 1.5+ hours we were waiting, i kept thinking to myself, "this better be worth it, this better be worth it." guess what? it totally is. i had the "menage-a-trois" served on dutch crunch, but also tried a friend's "al bundy". soooo gooey, garlicky, and GOOD. even thinking about it now is making me drool. i definitely plan on hitting up ike's in the near future, especially since they're opening one in palo alto!! :DThings I wish I knew before I went:-They accept orders over the phone (zomg, no need to wait in line?? sign me up!)-They accept credit cards!!-Chips come with your meal (good ones too - miss vicky chips! try the jalapeno if you're not afraid of spiciness)-No seating to enjoy your tasty sandwich (though there is plenty of sidewalk to sit on!)it's a bit on the pricey side for a sandwich, though you get tons more flavor and higher quality ingredients than subway or quiznos.
This is such a freaking amazing place! The staff is definitely friendly (and hilarious too!) When I was ordering my sandwich I was still jittery from eating a crap ton of ice cream and the waitress thought I was stoned out of my mind! She was really funny about my order. You don't typically find such unique customer service in other restaurants. That made my day, or I'm just really weird.Get the Manage a Trois. Delicious sandwich, has roasted chicken and honey mustard and other great fillings. They offer three types of bread, but the staff recommends getting your sandwich on a Dutch Crunch. Sandwiches come with a side of chips. I got the Funky Fusion, which is sort of a mix between BBQ and Mesquite Honey...definitely delicious! And they give you a freaking caramel-apple lollipop with your order. Talk about icing on the top. Sandwiches get kind of messy to eat (but that's part of the fun!) Since the sandwiches are kind of pricy too (~$12) it's best to ask them to split your sandwiches for 2 people. Trust me, 1/2 of one of their sandwiches is enough to fill one person. Lines get get long during lunch hours, but worth the wait.
It's not like the world needs another Ike's review, but it really is THAT good. I had the Veggie Nacho Boy Supreme, basically adding bacon to an already amazing sandwich. Could not put down this incredible creation until I finished it. It was crowded even at noon on a Tuesday, and I can see why. It's hard to write this review because it makes me want to go back there NOW. :-DThis is the place you take a friend who's visiting when you want them to move to the City. ;-)
This place has a lot of personality on character. Their food is over the top but still delicious. Unfortunately my hubby's Superman had a hair in it but when I came back to complain they made another one without missing a beat. They were kind and respectful about the problem and threw in a free drink. Their customer service won me over after that. The line was ridiculous so bring a friend or music to keep you entertained. Its worth it.Basically get it while you can, the food and the service is worth it.
Being that there are over 4500 reviews on Ike's there is very little chance I will be able to add to everything that has been said. That really lifts a strange unexplainable burden. Anyways I have finally had the chance to visit the most recent location on 16th street. I have not been since the tiny shop across the way existed because I now live in Oakland and eat at Ike's Lair. I am happy when a small local business succeeds as Ike's as done. Oddly it gives their sandwiches the distinct flavor of accomplishment. While eating the "Mnage  trois", you can feel like you too can live out your dreams happily. It is bold statement that a sandwich can make you want to go out and chase your dreams. But why can't it? Ike's doesn't have to be just a place to get a lunch. It can symbolize that we are fully capable of going out into the world and be successful while having positive affect on our community. So go pick up lunch, walk over to Dolores Park, sit and eat while people watching. Maybe you'll ponder what you're doing with your life, maybe you're not but at least you got a good sandwich.
Ike's place was recommended by a friend and I saw that it had high ratings so I decided to try it out with a group of friends that I was with to celebrate my birthday weekend. Ike's is not a sit down place, they have no place to sit but you can order your food and go to a nearby park to eat. We went in the knick of time before the line went out the door! Service was great at the register. The guy made suggestions and answered all the questions we had about the sandwiches!It's obviously a sandwich place and your meal comes with a caramel lollipop and a bag of chips. There's a wide selection of sandwiches but pull their menu off online b/c their chalk board menu does not list nearly all the sandwiches they have on the web. You get your choice of bread, whether or not you want tomatoes or lettuce on your sandwich, and it comes with their dirty sauce which is a mayo-based spread. Overall, it was pretty tasty and would bring other people to Ikes!
definitely overrated. if you're waiting 45 minutes for a sandwich, you're also the guy waiting an hour for bi-rite. call ahead, order a sandwich, see what the fuss is all about, then never go back again. you're welcome.
never have i ever came across a place like this, i would try to compare this place with another restaurant but you seriously can't, ike's set's their own standard that isn't comparable to another sandwhich place, it's like me trying to compare how similar a banana and a carrot is, you just can't do it very well.Ike's the king of decadent sandwiches. From its old location it is now moved into a lounge called lime on geary, i like the new location since now there is a waiting area where you can site down.They are known for their dirty sauce, but honestly i can't even taste it, theres too much going on in their sandwiches that focusing on a single ingredient is impossible because of the abundant ingredients in the sandwich overloads your mouth sensory organs.My favoites are the fat bastard, the hella fat bastard, king koopa and change,btw those are the only sandwiches i tried so far and i've kept on getting them, next i hella wanna get the Forty!??
I have finally tried out Ikes..... YES! The power was out the first time in the morning, and i was soo sad, especially after falling outside on the sidewalk... i was coming from Lime (thats all i need to say). So sadly, I was really bummed I didnt get to grab a sandwich, BUT Cory, the GM here came out and introduced himself and hung out while waiting for the power to come on. I also go bandaids from another employee here, everyone was VERY outgoing and chill =) They said sorry for the inconvenience and suggested us to come back later and hopefully the power was on. We went off on adventures in SF, and later in the day, we came back.. HAPPILY, business was back on! Cory came out and saw us, and told us to give him the order since we were there earlier (very thankful he remembered us), I asked for him to suggest sandwich, without hesitation he said Menaje Trois... excuse me? thats the sandwich Menaje Trois... SOLD. I'll get one of those. It came so nice and slightly warm in the paper bag...mmmm I could smell the goodness. Sadly I was SO FULL from the eating spree that we had all day, I couldnt eat it that night, BUT the following day, I enjoyed 1/2 of it for lunch... LET me tell you, even a day later... that sandwich is the BEST sandwich ive had in my life. It was so flavorful, the chicken was soo good, the saucy was nice and sweet, ughhhh TO DIE FOR, and that Dutch Crunch... just WOW.... just WOWGreat Service, Great workers, GREAT SANDWICH
Completely overrated. All the good things about this place are overshadowed by the bad.-With a $13 sandwich you get a FREE bag of chips...  (If they charged 11 and gave me the choice I'd be happier.)-The service is really nice and attentive...  (It is a real pity that it takes forever to get your food.)-They have a veggie meatball sub... (Too bad they mash the meatballs up and mix it with a bunch of "dirty" sauce so that it feels more like a falafel than a meatball sub. It is also SUPER GREASY!!!!)-They let you add poppers, mozzarella sticks or onion rings to your sub... (But they give you 3 soggy, greasy onion rings for $2)-And a double-bad situation, they tell you not to crowd the sidewalk or eat on the street, yet they have NO tables or any area to enjoy this sandwich anywhere else. I know that they are trying to be respectful but I would think that they could invest in a bigger spot if they are charging so much for sub-par food.  For my money I would rather eat at Mr. Pickles. At least they are much less greasy, they take the time to ask you exactly what you want on it, and don't have the horrible line/wait... Oh, and it is about half the price.I had really high hopes about this place but was so disappointed.
This was VERY embarrassing to talk them up after having such great experiences in the past, to have sandwiches that are now down to the size as subways sandwiches, and we all left still hungry! A lot has changed since they were featured on the food network in 2009. I paid my friend back for his sandwich it was so small, he definitely looked very upset that it costs $27, and I felt bad as he is pretty low income and I was the one who convinced him to try it.  Now you have a bigger location that has a massive kitchen and backroom and no dining area. Its clear where the priorities lie here and that is saving money by getting people out as fast as possible by giving them no where to sit. In 2009 the sandwiches were a lot bigger the bread was longer and the inside of the sandwich was easily 3x what it is today. I dont get veggies just meat and cheese and the "Jerry's Big Meat Sandwich" with meat and cheese combined was literally 1/2 inch thick! It used to be about 2 inches. For someone who LOVES meat they are going to notice such a drop in quality. My friend got his sandwich the "Nacho boy" that was at best 1/2 inch thick too. This with 2 sodas costs $27?? Those sandwiches were about the same price as today but easily twice as big." Definitely will not be bringing my friends here ever again. Not the quality or size sandwiches that were featured on the food network in 2009.
Holyymoollyyyy I love Ike's. Usually when a place is hyped up, I end up really disliking it...but nope...I still love Ike's!My boyfriend and I went at noon on a Wednesday so the line wasn't bad at all. I got the Eli Manning and he had ...Cheap Date (?something like that haha). I love love love loved the Eli Manning...like seriously...it was so good. Everyone was super friendly and nice too (:I'm so sad I live in San Diego..I'm craving it right now as I type this =[ I think I'll go up after finals, just for Ike's haha!
Dope sandwiches, the way you always imagined a good sandwich should taste, this place delivers. Crusty, chewy bread, good balance of crisp lettuce, sauce, and meat, and of course, great flavors.Friend had the menage trois (spicy mustardy and sticky honey good), I had the spiffy tiffy (fresh pesto flavor). SF sourdough was great - bubbly from being toasted and chewy and perfect. Caramel green apple lollipop with every sandwich is a fun touch and a nice little dessert.Wish I could have this for lunch everyday!
I'm sorry Ike's but I can't in good conscience give you a 5 star rating when another place is so vastly superior. HOWEVER you DO deserve a 4.5 star rating as everything I experienced at your shop was top notch! Ok so I visited the shop on one of the hottest days here in the city. It was probably 85 out and must have been another 5-7 degrees hotter inside. This is relevant because the ENTIRE staff was still upbeat and very, very friendly despite the boiling heat. The guy that took my order was talkative but not chatty and he quickly made a suggestion when I wasn't sure what bread to get, and he was right. The girl who gave me my sandwich had the biggest smile on her face that I'd seen in weeks. She was hot and miserable but she wore that smile! The shop was clean and nice with numerous accolades lining the walls. The assortment of drinks was appropriate but the flavors of Dirty Chips, points for having them, was not as robust as I'd hoped. Having said this the sandwich was DIVINE! The bread was perfectly toasted and the sandwich was warm throughout. Whatever sauce was on there...OMG! Perfect balance of flavor and ingredients were fresh and full of flavor. My only issue was that it is a a liiiiiiiiittle pricey. 15 bucks for a deli sandwich chips and a water guys? Come now. I only say this because I can get a sandwich twice the size plus chips and a bottled water for 10 at Antonelli's in San Diego. Anyway I will absolutely go here again it was superb all around. Good work!
I really don't see what all the hype is about. Yeah, their sandwiches are huge. Yeah, they are vegan friendly. Yeah, they taste okay. And then....?No and then! To wait in line for 30-45 minutes and pay almost $10 per sandwich is beyond my understanding. Even if they are pretty good.Kudos for the employees who pay attention to the littlest vegan details. I ordered one vegan sandwich and one non vegan. They switched out the caramel apple lollipop for a vegan one. That was nice.I guess it's just my Oaklandish State of Mind. I'd rather have Bakesale Betty's or Genova's. Those are worth the wait.
Does Ike's really need ANOTHER review? Why not? I love love love the Name of Girl I'm Dating on dutch crunch. Wait, that didn't come out right. Anyway, go. Seriously. Now.
Once my favorite, now ruined by popularity. There's a line down the block at all hours! And they won't take call-ahead orders (come on, this would save us all some time and hassle, no?). Not to mention the price increase...(Sigh). Back to burritos, falafels, and home-mades for me. I'll always remember our first meeting on a cold afternoon in February of 2008... (sniffle).
delicious! tons of options and all of them looked dope.
Delicious. 'Manage-a-Trois' is unlike any sandwich I've ever tried before. I was hoping the hype wasn't over exaggerated & I'm here to say these guys are on point. You gotta try the dutch crunch bread with your sandwich first! I also tried the 'Fat Bastard.' Not as wonderfully flavorful as the 'Manage-a-Trois,' but still a good sandwich! As I think about these sandwiches while typing this lil' review I find myself wanting the 'Manage-A-Trois' even more with each minute going by.When I return to the Bay Area, I'm hoping Ike's finds their new location! I'll follow you guys wherever you go!
Small, fun place. Split a Paul Ruben's and a Name of the Girl. Loved both of them - just wish the Paul Ruben's had sour kraut on it. Loved how we got a bag of chips and a sucker as well. Only thing I was a bit sad about was no place to eat there - but that's all a part of the fun atmosphere. Would def go back.
Man vs. Food, 4 1/2 star rating on yelp = bookmarked After getting some salted caramel ice cream from bi-rite, I ventured over to Ike's Place on a mission to try the supposedly best sandwich in the bay. There was a line but it wasn't that long probably around 8-9 people. Called in an hour and a half before hand to get my sandwiches ready, (Because I heard this place had a crazy wait, should do that if you want to explore other places in SF before coming here) It was one of the most difficult choices I have ever had to make in deciding which sandwich to get, almost like multiple choice questions on tests when you don't know which answer you should choose. I seriously wanted to try everything because it all sounded great. In the end, I ended up getting the Tony Soprano on Dutch Crunch Bread, with Dirty jalapeno chips. (picked this one cause I like turkey,ham, Italian dressing and provolone cheese) Shared it because I though it was going to be huge from some previous reviews but its not really that huge, you could probably finish it in one sitting, As I devoured my half, I thought to myself "damn should have bought one just for myself" thats how good it was, delicious "Dirty"sauce dripping off the sandwich (just like the Carls Jr. commercials) with warm meat and delicious bread (wished it was more crunchy but satisfactory) but I wouldn't say its the best. The chips were extremely salty and had a great jalapeno flavor to it but too salty for my taste buds Note-No seats, workers are extremely nice and friendly, it's extremely cramped inside. but was it worth 10 bucks maybe/maybe not, the world may never no. Oh and almost forgot the caramel pops were a very nice touch after finishing the sandwich.
the absolute BEST sandwich I ever had! Better than all those chain sandwich places! I only wish that they had MORE locations! A must try!
I REALLY wanted to love Ike's Place.But I only kind of liked Ike's Place - kinda.The wait wasn't bad at all, the people working there are all super friendly, they definitely have a system down. And given that this place has been on our list of things to try for a while, I don't regret giving it a shot. But truly, it was merely A-OK and nothing more or less.We had the Pizzle with avocado and the Menage-a-Trois with avocado.The Pizzle (halal chicken breast, bacon, ranch, cheddar) was definitely a solidly satisfying sandwich, with lots of ranch and saucy goodness. But the bacon on it was stale tasting (they don't seem to have anywhere to be frying bacon so we assumed it was the microwaveable type?) and there really was no cheese to speak of. I wish the chicken breast was at least in chunks and not shredded (the way its shredded makes it the texture of tuna salad not chicken and this made the sandwich somewhat mushy with little bite or chew to speak of). Overall it was just a somewhat hot, messy, good sandwich with lots of flavor but Quiznos could probably make something pretty similar tasting.The Menage-a-Trois (Halal Chicken Breast, Real Honey, Honey Mustard, BBQ, PepperJack, Swiss, Smoked Gouda) was sloppy and pretty good and I was wow'd at first but to be honest once the thrill was gone and I kept eating it the ONLY thing I tasted on it was the overpowering BBQ sauce. I tasted no honey, no honey mustard, no pepperjack, no swiss, and no smoked gouda whatsoever. And since I didn't taste any of it, I really didnt understand the thrill of a shredded chicken salad sandwich slathered in sweet BBQ sauce with wilted hot shredded lettuce. Good yes, but the most popular sandwich on Yelp? Hellz no. Not even close.Overall, like I said, these were satisfying sandwiches and I wish I'd gone before the hype got all out of control - maybe they used to be better sandwiches when there was less of a rush to throw everything onto the bread and into a bag to the endless line of customers waiting on the sidewalk. Nothing about Ike's really stood out to me, and I would have a hard time going back and spending $30 on two sandwiches again any time soon. Not worth the hype, in this Yelpers opinion.
Stopped in for a Sat lunch. The line moved fast and our order of two subs came out in 5 minutes. Menage a Trois (chicken) and Hasta la Vista (roast beef). YUMMY! My friend and I enjoyed only half of our sandwiches because they were so large. Saved the other half for later. We were hoping for a table or ledge to eat on. Disappointed with no where to set our bottles and sandwiches and chips except for in our laps.
I'm from Los Angeles and this place is simply amazing. I'm thinking of coming to San Francisco again just for these sandwiches.My family came in a HUGE 12-person wolfpack so we dropped a couple of them off to wait in line while we got parking (5 friggin blocks away!). We then cut the line to where my cousins were in front. HA! We did get in trouble though and only 1 of us got offered a drink/chips/t-shirt.Everything here was DELICIOUS. I had the hella fat bastard (mozarella sticks in my sandwich!!), my girlfriend had the manage-a-trois, and I sampled all my other cousins' including the super mario and milf. Hell, one of my little cousins is really picky and just had a sandwich with only bread and meatballs and that still tasted really good!Be prepared to wait in line 30+ minutes. Well, if you don't cut the line =),I highly recommend the hella fat bastard for guys and the manage-a-trois for girls. And don't skimp on the dirty sauce!
Came here again and of course I had to order the spiffy tiffy with breaded chicken instead of regular chicken. This one seriously never disappoints! I took my sister and her friend here (they were visiting from Vancouver) and they absolutely loved this one. We also ordered the "name of the girl im dating" and that one wasnt as great. The chicken actually seemed a bit dry and there wasnt that much flavor? Maybe we shouldve gotten more sauce or added something else to it. Spiffy Tiffy was still awesome but the second sandwich was a little disappointing, especially in comparison.
Finally tried this location on afternoon Fri, after the last day of GDC 2011 in the Moscone Con (lots of cool stuff there) So I parked hecka far and walked about a mile to build up an appetite for the impending caloric inhalation.After all I did order many beasts.Menage a troisLex Luther Kryptonite Service here is spotty. I noticed the cashier being a bit too chatty with the folks. Waiting area is messy, w chips all over the floor. Lots of college students/young here as well so it can be a bit loud and annoying.I think I prefer the in and out of the Redwood shores location. My order was supposed to be ready at 4:10, but I still had to wait to get to the cashier (she was chatting to much) so total wait time was 15 min or so. Sandwich wise - Very good.Kryptonite - Roast Beef, Corned Beef, Pastrami, Salami, Turkey, Bacon, Ham, Mozzarella Sticks, Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers, Beer Battered Onion Rings, Avocado, Pesto, EXTRA Pepper Jack I was expecting it to be one large s'which packed with all the goods, but it's actually two! The meats and ingredients all combined to form the hulking Kryptonite. I ate 3/4 of one half the s'which on the way home, and ate some more during dinner.Lex Luther - Pound Niman Ranch Beef Burger, Chicken Fried Steak, Rib Eye Steak, Mozzarella Sticks, American -Although I liked the ingredients i wasn't impressed with it to much. I would prefer the Kryp.  The mooza sticks don't melt too well for some reason when I heated them up the next day. I ate one entire half (it came with two).Menage - Halal Chicken Breast, Real Honey, Honey Mustard, BBQ, PepperJack, Swiss, Smoked Gouda - This is pretty tasty. I like how it's rich, sweet, and creamy.All the s'whiches i bought created leftovers which spanned two days. not bad considering i spent 54.00.Will be back but to a closer location next time (redwood shores).Overall, the s'whiches here are pretty damn tasty, and worth checking out..
Slow day on Friday before the crowd. Waited 20 minutes in line. Not bad, right?They make good sandwiches, no doubt...but unfortunately overrated. That's the price for being THAT popular, too high of an expectation. $12/ sandwich PLUS waiting in line. I got better things to do with my time and I know sandwich spots on par with Ike's and for half the price.
Dude, what was that. Seriously what was that. I walked out of there asking myself that. These people are way toooooo nice. What are these people eating every morning to put them in such good moods. Its was all pretty weird... in a good way.Note: Ok so according to Yelp, the above was written 19 months ago. It's when I started that review, probably about the same time that you were allowed to draft reviews. Better late than never!Anyway. A lot has changed with Ike's over the past year and a half. One thing is for sure, they're WAY busier. The sandwiched and service are all still fantastic, just plan ahead. You will be glad you did. Yum.
Ike's is awesome! He personally delivers your sandwiches to you. There are so many sandwiches to choose from and they each have a witty name. Definitely going to come back but going to call in our order to avoid the wait. Conveniently located inside of Lime. So grab a drink while you wait!
IKE'S = the definition of livin' up to the hype!Pre-Ike's Kristine:"I'm just not that into sandwiches," at least not like some people. I just didn't get it--it's just stuff in between bread. Certainly not something I'd go out of my way to get, let alone pay for. "I'm just not into meat." For almost two years I only ate the flesh of animals that lived in water. It wasn't because I loved cute little animals (which I do) or was against animal cruelty (which I am). It had more to do with the fact that I didn't want touch raw meat/ learn how to cook and that I was (am) poor. Post-Ike's Kristine:"Git in that kitchen (preferably Ike's) and make me a sammich, (wo)man!" I want it big, messy, and heart-cloggingly SEXY! "Gimme that REAL MAN'S MEAT!" I want cow or pig--no messing with animals that can fly; can't trust 'em. "Gimme me one of dem COWBOY CURTIS' (the Pee Wee-lovin' girl inside me couldn't resist)!" Pastrami, poppyseed coleslaw, gouda, and bbq...[Homer drool] Crunchy, savory, and sweet--the holy trinity of mouth watering food. Tip: Do yourself a favor, call in your order unless you want to wait in line FOREVER. That way you can grab your sammiches and head over to Dolores without going on a hunger-induced killing spree, unless you're into that kind of thing. I'm not judging.
My cousin recently brought me here when I was out west visiting him in SF and this place is one of the best sandwich joints I've ever had. The line out the door is the first indication of popularity and is always a good sign for a small shop. The line moved quickly and the service was relatively pain free (the wait was a bit longer than expected and we were HUNGRY, but the free chips were a plus). I ordered the Matt Cain and was pleasantly surprised by how well the ingredients meshed to make a seriously great sandwich. The BREAD was crunchy and toasted extremely well which is a plus in any sandwich lover's check list. The sauce was what brought the Matt Cain together for me. I forgot what it was called but it added another dynamic flavor to the meat. I definitely recommend this joint to anyone in the area and will be visiting again when I'm back out west.
I've had the same sandwich here twice now, there is so much to choose from but I guess it was just destined for me to eat the Kryptonite not once but twice..Now before you start thinking that I finished the monstrosity of a sandwich..well actually yes i did finish the sandwich..just not in one sitting haha.This gigantic sandwich, where do i begin? Pastrami, turkey, roast beef, salami, bacon, ham, mozzarella sticks, onion rings, jalapeno poppers, avocado, and pepper jack..all on dutch. I think i might of left out something but I dont think so.Its a lot of sandwich, a little too much, after eating a quarter of it you realize that its just meat and too much meat. Its tasty and all but its not a sandwich that you can really just enjoy. So the next time I go there I will be sure to pick a decent sized sandwich.Ah yes, before I finish, I need to thank my aniki, Tim for buying me this sandwich and my friend Rich for buying me the other.
This place is awesome. Glad it's back. Glad this hot girl works here. If you want great sandwiches at great prices go here!
I had heard the hype of this place from all angles (I'm talking gang bang of hype--Man vs Food; Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives; Yelp; everyone including yo mama) and I had to finally see what this place was about.After seeing the 4.5 stars on yelp for 1800+ reviews, hearing Guy say on TV that this is the best sandwich ever, and after waiting in line for TWO (count it TWO) hours for this sammy, you'd think I'd be disappointed...I even started sulking in line, "If this isn't a life changing experience, it won't live up to this expectation."Alright, it was probably the best sandwich I have ever had. I can't explain it because they use the same ingredients as every other no-name shop out thre, but this place truly makes a unique sandwich. Believe everyone when they say--YOU WANT THE DIRTY SAUCE. The sandwiches I tried:        #59: Cristina and Umair Go To Ikes: Verdict?        AMAZING. Turkey, Bacon, Ham, Salami, Italian        dessing, Avocado, and Provolone....Need I say        more?? Considering how much meat is on this--        it was very refreshing! Humongous sub, perfectly        made.        #132: Change: Verdict? I think I understand the title...        This is a change--you can't find a sandwich like this        ANYWHERE! Thinly sliced rib eye, beer battered onion        rings, BBQ sauce and smoked gouda. OMG OMG.        Perfectly tender and doesn't taste heavy at         all--PERFECTION!Both of these sandwiches are a total WIN. (As is probably every other sandwich on the gargantuan menu). The next time I go back, however, I will NOT wait in line. CALL AHEAD. That is the best advice someone can give. If you are coming from out of the city, call on your way, it'll be ready by the time you get there (wait on the weekends is usually 1.5-2 hours). MUCH BETTER than wating for eternity on the sidewalk.NO JOKE. TWO HOUR WAIT IN LINE. THIS IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION. CALL AHEAD. DON'T BE A FOOL. STAY IN SCHOOL. DO NOT DROOL. the end.
So I will never pay $10 for a sandwich, ever. However, Ike's is definitely an exception. These sandwiches are truly amazing. I think that everything has already been said in previous reviews but just to reiterate, they have a huge selection for not only meat eaters but vegetarians AND vegans! The Dutch Crunch is the best bread I've ever tasted on a sandwich ever!! Me and my husband went with our vegan friends and they loved LOVED LOVED their selections. One had the vegan meatball sub and he loved it. I had the "name of the girl i'm dating" sandwich and even though I was full by the first half, I did not want to stop eating. My husband had a sandwich with chicken and red hot sauce, i forgot the name of it but it was delicious too. We paid $22 for 2 sandwiches but it includes a bag of kettle chips which are also sooo good. No regrets at all for going to this place and we will definitely be going back!! Our goal is to try all their sandwiches =)
I knew we'd made the right choice when I saw the line forming on a Friday afternoon, but it moved pretty quickly. Most memorable thing about Ike's? THE BREAD.The Dutch Crunch (a toasty crunchy sourdough) was scrumptious. I loved the numerous selections, and it was a perfect meal to grab and take to Dolores park. My sandwich was a littttle over dressed. It got slightly soggy on the short walk to the park, but with nowhere to eat in, your choices are limited... Worth the walk and wait though!
Thank you, from the bottom of my tummy.
I've only been once, but this place seems pretty overrated. I got a Barack (steak and gouda) on dutch crunch and a Leninade for $15?!. Tasted good, but ohhh my tummy now ): I think it's the dirty sauce. It's one of those things that sounds good, but...it's just a sloppy, greasy mess. Take a cheesecake, deep fry it, put bacon on top, and if that sounds rad, Ike's is the place for you. Since I live a block away, I may go back again and try something else tho.
The dirty sauce is very tasty. The sandwiches are really big, it's like 2 meals for me.
I was definitely happy to see a place where I could get a good vegan sandwich. Reading countless positive reviews helped ease the hour and a half wait...well, a little bit. By the time I ordered my food, I was starved. I devoured the bag of chips as soon as humanly possible, so I wasn't very hungry by the time my sandwich arrived. The place seemed very frantic, with people rushing in and out of the tiny place. On the bright side, my order came out quickly, and it tasted great. Next time I would order ahead. That would eliminate a lot of issues I had here.
I'd say 4.5 stars! YAY! And I'm pretty hard to please so...this is pretty good.Like everyone and their moms, I came here before it closes! Called in right when they opened at 10 AM and holey moley the line was busy for about 10 minutes. Finally they took in my order at 10:20 and I ordered 3 sammies: the Menage a Trois (thanks to 7 x 7), Spiffy Tiffy, and the Eli Manning (my pops wanted it after he read someone else got it via Yelp). My order was ready to pick up at 11:10 which was easy peasy and what a nice surprise! It came with chips and a lollipop! The sandwiches...well they were all delicious. Reason being: the dutch crunch bread was clutch. The garlicky dirty sauce really soaked into the fresh bread and wowowowowowow it was so delicious! The cheese was nice and melty on the bread. The Menage-a-Trois was good, but a little too barbequey for me. The Eli Manning was cool but not enough intensity to the flavors for me. But the SPIFFY TIFFY...dank. (Dank as in extremely tasty). The pesto truly made the sandwich a winner winner chicken dinner! All the sandwiches were juicey though. It was the best part. And the warm yummy bread.OH! Not to mention the workers are SO nice and friendly and fun to make conversation with.Try it before it leaves SF! I'm sure the other ones that open are going to be shit compared to SF's! It's the long-wait, ginormous hype, small building, and the fact that it's just in SF that gives this place and the sandwiches the magic. Fact.
I had the menage a trois because i need to cross it off my 7x7 list. It was delicious. The bread was soft and chewy. I'm not sure if they make it themselves, nor do i care. Everything about the sandwich was delicious. While i was standing in line, they asked us to sign a petition because they just passed an eviction notice for them. I advise to all those to care to speak up and those who don't...to get to Ikes before they close down!
I saw lot of reviews of this place and those reviews were true. Great place
Dear Ike, I love you. Seriously, i love you! Please marry me and make me sandwiches everyday? please? and i promise to be your sugar mamacita! Love, Novela superstar :) ________ I heard they shut down Ike's and i was about to Riot the city. Born and raised in LA, I've heard so much about this place from fellow yelpers. When starring at the yelp pictures, i felt like i was looking at Internet porn. It felt forbidden. My Veggie boo and i came to SF and we got lost trying to find Ike's and walked for 2 hours before we found it!!!!!! I see Ike standing outside of Lime's and i yell; "OMG!!!!!!! IKEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" I thought i saw Jesus. I tell him; "you dont know me! but i know you! i came from LA and I'm sooo excited to try your sandwiches!" (I'm a fat ass, i know). He just looked at me and said; "...welcome!". FML :( We order our food and i was sold on the Jessica Rabbit. Jalapeo poppers on a sandwich??? Can someone say destiny? I get my sandwich and i orgasmed in my pants about 5 times while eating this thing. It was food Porn. AAAAAHHHMAZING! I had ranch on my face, grease on my lips, and i looked a hot mess. But that's okay, because this was the best meal of my life. I could honestly die now. BUUTTTT- I dont plan to because i found the love of my life- IKE!!!!After eating i went up to Ike and begged him to come to LA. He said he plans too! YAAAAYYYYYYYYY! Hopefully next year i will be Mrs. 'Ike' Jessica rabbit ;) CHHAAAOO!!!!
I've always had good experiences with Ikes, but today was especially great. The line was out the door, but they had an employee outside asking trivia questions, which helped pass the time, with the reward of a blow pop.Once inside, my cashier, Scotty, was so nice and friendly that he made my day. I called later in the day to find out his name: Thank you for serving me with a smile!
Before trying Ike's.. My ULTIMATE sandwich place was only GRINDERS SUBMARINE SANDWICHES in Montclair in Oakland. But everyone kept saying I needed to try Ike's.. so Im open to new things so I did. 4.5 Stars for overall experienceSandwich: 5 StarsI ordered the Hollywood's San Francisco Cheesesteak (around $12) on Dutch Crunch. It was THEEE best dutch crunch ever, so fresh and soft yet still has its crunch. Very mouth watering. It was amazing! I highly recomend dutch crunch as your choice of bread it just makes the whole sandwich tenn times better.Location: 4 StarsIt's located in a residential area, so i believe there has been many complaints about Ike's because there's always long lines outside of people's house and Ike's customers sitting on their stoops eating their sandwiches. I had to walk a few blocks to reach a park right accross from Mission high school i believe to sit and enjoy my sandwich. But the adventure was wroth it. Sandwich was really good.Restaurant: 4 StarsIt's very small. You have to wait outside for them to call you in to choose your chips, drinks, and then pay. And then they walk out with your sandwich ready to go. So if you're super hungry, be prepared to walk/drive and eat. When I went there was no outdoor seating.Wait Time: MAKE SURE TO CALL IN. It takes about an hour and some minutes to make, especially during their peak time.. which is ALL DAY, haha. I called in about 12:30 and i was at Powell st and they said it would be ready in an hour. And i arrived to Ike's 1:15, and there were two lines. EVEN for PICK UP there was a line.. i didn't know that haha. So make sure to line up. I was able to get my drink and chips while i waited.. then i got my sandwich at 1:40. So.. do I like IKE's better than Grinders? I think Ike's Bread is much better.. and i LOVE their DIRTY sauce.. but other than that, i like them equally. Maybe I have to try all the other sandwiches :]
After a long morning of rock climbing at Planet Granite using our Groupons, my friends and I decided to grab a sandwich at Ike's using another deal we snagged online. After hearing horror stories of the weekend lines there, we decided to call our orders in ahead of time. Great idea and highly recommended! It was raining super hard that day, but it didn't stop people from lining up outside of Lime, and it didn't stop the door man from being a complete d-bag! I understand Lime is a bar and you need to be 21 to get in, but this guy was standing front acting like it was Buckingham Palace. Ninja please! At first, we thought it would be impossible to eat inside the place, but it was surprisingly empty inside. Hmm. Sound familiar? Clubs usually hold the line outside to make it look crazy, but a bar/restaurant? Chill the F out man, throat chop to your adams apple! Anyway, I know that none of that is Ike's fault and they are just trying to get their sandwiches served to the people. Being my first visit, I decided to grab one of their bigger sandwiches, the superman on Dutch Crunch. There is nothing special about the sandwich at all, but it just tastes pretty damn good. The meat is ordinary deli meat and the fillings are pretty generous, as they should be for about $10 per sandwich. The superman costs $20, and is twice the size of the regular sandwiches there. Side story, after grabbing our bag, there were 6 sandwiches of equal size in there, so we thought Ike's screwed up. Wrong! The superman is pretty much 2 sandwiches, which is why it costs $20 and it is definitely enough for 2 normal non-Joey Chestnut-type of people. It's not the best sandwich I've ever had, but it was a really good sandwich. Ike's sauce lives up to its reputation, but calling in my order is definitely the only way I would come back here. I would not wait 2 hours in a line controlled by a d-bag to get a sandwich.
Am I missing something...?First time here, was expecting to wait for at least an hour, waited an hour forty five. Rare beautiful sunny day in the city though with good company, so no biggie. Bring a group of people so they can hop out and reserve a place in line while the driver circles the block 18 times for parking. The line moves slow, but once your order is taken, the sandwiches come out relatively quickly (10-15 min). Note: customer service was super friendly, always a good thing when you wait an hour plus in line to order food. I selected "Change" (steak, gouda, onion rings, BBQ sauce) after much deliberation. Judging from Yelp reviews, I was expecting the best/juiciest/fresh/unique sandwich EVER to touch my lips and make my taste buds dance with glee. Eh...the only thing remarkable about this sandwich was it's size and price. I couldn't even finish it, and I can usually pack away a good amount of food. The sandwich ingredients were only so-so, and my taste buds definitely did NOT do a jig. $10 for a so-so sandwich + $1 for extra dirty sauce?! Glad I finally got to "experience" the Ike's that everyone has been raving about...but I won't return.
Definitely lives up to its rep to me. the great dutch crunch bread and banana peppers on the Matt Cain. YUM!  I would return next time I'm in the area
Hands down best sandwiches I've ever had. Many different combinations, with a strong emphasis on flavor. I've had several different sandwiches, all extremely tasty! (Menage a Trois, Napoleon Complex, Meatless Mike, The Change). Creative combinations with many different ingredients, with so many different kinds of sandwiches (including vegetarian options), it's bound to please everyone! Unfortunately, there's no seating, so be prepared to order and leave to eat elsewhere. I highly recommend ordering ahead on the website or phone to avoid the long wait. I'm pretty sure every time I come to SF, I'll force a trip to Ike's Place! Until then, I'll just have to dream about it...
What can I say about Ike's that hasn't already been said in 626 reviews?This place is the real deal. The bee's knees. The cat's meow. The fresh prince of sandwich establishments. I tried to do my research before heading over here for the first time but knew I had to just dive in or else I'd be agonizing over the menu for hours. I was a bit overwhelmed with options as soon as I stepped in, but the cashier chick must have seen the fear in my eyes and guided me through my sandwich selection. Turkey? Sure. Avocado? Of course. Cheddar? Damn straight. Red pesto made with sun-dried tomatoes? Make me that sandwich already-- it's the Jim Rome!Artfully tossed together on a sourdough roll, I have to admit it was one helluva sandwich. Chewy bread giving way to the most tender bites of turkey and fresh ingredients-- it was a party in my mouth that I didn't want to end.One star off for a little bit of a wait, but that probably wouldn't stop me from coming here and sampling the entire menu if I lived nearby. Ike's, keep on-a-truckin'.
My friend couldn't stop talking about this place. How this was the best place sandwich she had ever eaten. So I had to check it out.Let me just say that the sandwich was a solid 3.5 stars. BUT ONLY because of the dirty sauce.Let's be honest, a sandwich is a sandwich. It contains meat, lettuce, tomatoes, and sauce. It's very easy to distinguish a good sandwich and a bad sandwich just by the quality of the ingredients. I ordered the Al Borland, my friends ordered the Manage a Trois and the Change. It was all mediocre. The lettuce was fast food quality (fast food sandwich as in Subway, Quiznos, Togos), the tomatoes were fast food quality the bread was Quiznos quality, BUT the dirty sauce was awesome.I got the dutch crunch. They have this bread at Quiznos. I know for a fact that Quiznos bread is shipped pre-baked (not fresh). You can taste the difference. Subway bakes their bread at the spot (which is why Subways smell so bad) and if you can find a Subway that bakes properly you can taste the difference in bread quality between Subway and Quiznos. With that being said, the dutch crunch at Ike's was about as good as Quiznos. Which isn't that good to begin with.Also, they smothered my sandwich with the dirty sauce. Which is good and bad. Good because the sauce tastes really good, bad because I couldn't taste anything else besides the sauce. The last four bites of my sandwich was bread and sauce, and it tasted EXACTLY like the rest of my sandwich that contained everything else. No joke.It also took us 30 minutes to get our sandwiches. There was no line. Which means it took them 10 minutes to make each of our sandwiches. Had I gone to Subway or Togos, I could have gotten at least 10 sandwiches in that time. For cheaper.Sandwich cost: 10 + tax + 3 dollars for meter parking (25 cents covered 10 minutes).I could have gone to Quiznos or Subway or Togos and paid half that price and gotten a sandwich twice as big but slightly not as good. But I'd rather go to Quiz, Sub, or Togos than Ikes, the price to taste ratio isn't worth it. Really, it's all hype.
Let's start with the sandwiches. Not only are the very good they have a ridiculous number of choices. If you work or live near here you have it made. You could work this place into the rotation frequently and not feel you are repeating all the time. I say the sandwiches are a 4 to 5 star.But I went here at about 6:00pm. The reason this is important is because someone had the brilliant idea of sharing space with Lime. Lime is some crazy confusing night club/run down bar or something. It opens at 5 and Ike's closes at 7. This two hour overlap is what you want to stay clear of. Hit this place for lunch and go somewhere else for dinner until they grow up and move into their own location again.My 3 probably has more to do with the fact that I went there during that odd mix of confusion.
It's Ike's. Need I say more? Not the easiest place to find, but by far one of the best sandwiches in the history of sandwiches. I've tried the Kryptonite, the Change, and the Lex Luthor, and NONE of them have dissappointed. I love the fact that the chips they give with the sandwiches are also extremely good (I'm not much of a chip guy). I don;t know what they do the sandwiches to make them so good, but I hope they never change. One thing I do wish they had was unlimited sodas, like a fountain dirnk station or something. Other than that, it's a MUST GO.P.S. The sandwiches I mentioned are probably one of the bigger sandwiches they have, EAT WITH CAUTION.
I don't get it.Have tried it twice and the sandwiches were completely disgusting. Plus,t he place looks dirty. A bunch of flavorless goop on soggy bread. Go to the "Sandwich Lady" on 14th st. Way way better.
Hands down one of the best sandwich I have ever eaten. I ordered the Spiffy Tiffy on the Dutch Crunch and it was delicious. Totally worth the price, the sandwiches are huge and it comes with a bag of chips.The chicken tasted great and I loved the sauce they put on the sandwich. There was a line but the service was fast and prompt. Everyone working there seemed very nice and handled the crush of people very well. Only downside was that I wished there was more room for seating.
I couldn't believe that on a misty Friday afternoon, there was a line that's two houses long, waiting to order sandwiches at Ike's. If it's this long on a misty day, how long does it get on a nice sunny day?! Me and my friend probably waited 15 minutes to order and then another 20 while they prepared our sandwiches. Props for the huge selection of veggie, vegetarian and vegan sandwiches. Me and my friend ordered two vegan ones. Did they meet our expectations? They were good, but aren't deserving of all the hype. Plus, they were a little small for our appetite. They filled us, but didn't satisfy us. Glad to have tried Ike's. I will come back again and get in line when I'm not hungry because by the time I get my food, I will be ready to eat!
Heart attack smashed in bread. Told myself I would never eat at Ike's again after the numerous mistakes made to my simple request of "no mayo or dirty sauce". Lot's of mayo covered sandwiches tossed away due to the crew that works there. Promised my business partner we could do lunch there and we would try it at the lime location. Cashier obviously new and has never worked a register before. She over charged our credit card by 20+ bucks, manager had to come over and they had to give us cash, no biggie, just annoying. After 25 minutes of waiting in Lime's 'beat down' looking restaurant (WHAT happened to that place!!) the sandwiches were finally done. I had to inspect the sammy onsite to make sure mayo wasn't on, surprisingly it wasn't. We took them home and ate them during a business chat. Pretty tasty, I must admit. I might get another Ike's sandwich in a year after I burn the calories from this one.
Ike personally contacted me via yelp due to the mediocre review I left his sandwich palace (below). He apologized about the mistake and invited me to return for a free sandwich. I called in my order during the busy lunch rush on a hot sf day. Ike groupies were lined up down the block waiting to order. I walked to the front of the line and announced my presence. A cute boy handed me my sandwich and said, "Just in time, Sunny. Ike told me about you." The sandwich was very tasty, very good. However, I am concerned about the paper used to wrap the sandwiches, as it gets stuck to the sandwich in a really wrong way. I just want you to be the best, Ike! Thank you so much for the lovely experience. ps Ike's is hiring
Oh my. I thought I knew sandwiches. I was even one of those guys who dubbed extra awesome sandwiches "sammiches". I have no words for these... they are just that good.My first time in, I didn't know what to expect. The menu stretched before me with all these specialties, and I geniuinely had no idea what to get but the owner Ike just pointed to the signs below and had me go for the Super Mario meatball sub. He even upgraded it to the Super Wario, which I believe added mozzarella sticks. It took awhile to get the sandwich assembled and melted into ooey-gooey awesomeness but it was absolutely worth it.Great service, amazing sandwiches, I feel lucky that the day I went there was no line. Pretty sure I won't be able to luck out again next time I'm in the mood for a sandwich coma.
Is it bad that my mouth is watering while I write this review? My boyfriend took me here last Thursday after running around with the crazy Giants fan at AT&T park. I was worried that they wouldn't have anything I could eat since a lot of sandwiches include meat and I didn't want tuna. Again. I was glad to see they had a huge selection, including vegan items.I went for the Papa Sam. Its a salmon burger patty with onion rings on dutch crunch. I got everything on it. We got our sandwiches and they were hot and crunchy. OMG. The salmon burger had so much flavor and the onion rings made the sandwich that much better. I absolutely loved the dirty sauce. It's some aioli sauce that's slathered on all their sandwiches and its a MUST. My only regret is not asking for extra dirty sauce. I can't wait to go back. =)
My brother's and I did a sandwich tour of San Francisco this summer and Ike's was the best in the city.I always get Dutch Crunch bread and the Matt Cain, Super Mario and Menage a Trois are my go to sandwiches.
We're In SF and we yelp to see what the best place to eat is and we run across this Yelp Juggernaut. A ton of reviews and almost all are 5 stars, I am pumped to eat here! I read about the long lines, who cares?! I read about all the different kinds of things they have to choose from, great!Well it was kind of tough to find parking when we went, which I will say has no bearing on my review just something to think about if they ever wanted to expand. Yes they did have a long line but it was only like 25 mins (mind you I'm pumped about eating here and I don't know what to order anyway so that time flew by).So we finally order some sandwiches with weird names and dirty sauce etc. Get their special chips, the whole thing.I eat the food and it's pretty good. I love sandwiches and this does definitely have a different flavor and it's own greasy appeal. But honestly it was not mind blowing and the size of the sandwich was small. For the price you'd at least expect to get kind of full. Was it worth the wait (even the short wait that I had), THE PRICE, and the drive from the the SF zoo? LOL hell no. If I was in the area and I wanted a quick sandwich I'd stop but they don't do quick. I did enjoy that it had a different taste but all things considered I'd rather just make a good sandwich at home and save some cash and time the ingredients aren't anything special.I wanted to like it more I really did but it just isn't that impressive. I wouldn't mind hiring the owner to help me open my small business because he has generated a good amount of buzz.
Meh. Ordered to go with co-workers. They were raving about this place. Got my sandwich and it was a sloppy mess. Flavors were too busy and a mismash of stuff. I want a sandwich, not a dripping mess. I was expecting better. WAY over rated.
Ikes is the bomb. no other way to say it. a MUST try place if you are rolling through the bay area. and with so many different locations you have no excuse. The halal chicken stuff is super amazing. My favorite was the Hot Luna something or another that had franks red hot mixed into the shredded chicken. So great. And dont just commit to the pre defined menu, the staff is always open to adding new stuff and mixing things up. if you dont try it you're super duper missing out.
All I have to say is " Do You Smell What Barrack is Cookin?"I went here on a whim with a girlfriend of mine and OMG. I got this sandwich and add onion rings to the sandwich and I was in heaven for the next two days. This sammy hot or cold is absolutely amazing and I can't wait to come back here again.
Excellent, giant sandwiches. My favorite is the Matt Cain. The godfather sauce is wonderful.
As a visitor to San Francisco, this was my second trip to Ike's Place after one of their sandwiches blew me away last time (unfortunately I don't remember which sandwich, but it might've been the Paradise Found). This time I tried the highly recommended Manage A Trois. It was good but I think tomatoes don't go well in the sandwich (my own fault - I ordered it with tomatoes added). I only ate half for lunch and saved the other half for dinner later which was still tasty after heating it up in a toaster oven! I look forward to my next visit to try a different item on their menu. P.S. They now offer Dirty Potato Chips with each sandwich but with a overall slight price increase on their menu. And they still give the Caramel Apple Pops!
Move over triple crown of sandwiches of the peninsula (Little Lucca, Mr. Pickles, Bonne Sante) - the best 'wich in the Bay resides right here, no questions. Yea it's a few bucks more expensive than the others and the line is a bit much, but their sandwich blows my mind. We ordered the Menage a Trois and the Cowboy Curtis - both equally exceptional. I had just eaten lunch prior and was expecting to take a bite and save the rest for later...fail. Ike's Place, win.
What does a person think as they stand in line for an hour and a half, on a sunny Saturday afternoon, waiting patiently for "a sandwich" you might ask. I would in turn ask you why you've insulted your soon to be creation by giving it such a mediocre, generic term. But in answer to your question, a person thinks a lot of things in that time, mostly about the behemoth offering Ike will shortly (sorry Ike, no pun intended) bestow upon you. You may go on to ask if it's worth the wait, to which I would slap you, and say relax and be cool (unless you're my wife asking, in which case I would say yes baby I promise). Thanks to Yelp, Man Vs Food, and a whole horde of other food related media outlets, Ike's has become somewhat of a neighborhood phenomenon, thus the long lines (yelp.com/biz_photos/dold) which are aided somewhat by menus passed out well in advance of your arrival at the door.For me, the choice was obvious after reading the menu online as I prepared for my visit here. I would have to try the Doomsday, the largest sandwich on the menu (so I thought), anything else was just playing for second place. However, once I actually got up to order, the friendly gentleman behind the register informed me of an addition to the printed/online menu, the Kryptonite (yelp.com/biz_photos/dold), a special concoction dreamed up especially for Man vs Food's Adam Richman. Loaded to the brim with FOUR AND A HALF POUNDS of roast beef, pastrami, salami, turkey, bacon, ham, mozzarella sticks, stuffed jalapeno poppers, beer battered onion rings, pesto, avocado and extra pepper jack cheese, this thing makes the Doomsday roll over and beg for mercy. Of course I had no choice but to step up to the plate and take the challenge.I honestly don't think my photos can prepare you for how massive the Kryptonite is, I know even when I was looking at it I thought it was deceptively smaller in size than weight. Once you take that first bite though, and all those flavors start to hit you, and you look down and see the tiniest of dints you've just put into it, you'll realize you're in for a long battle. I was successful in conquering my Kryptonite, but without much room to spare. I've read the record for finishing is somewhere around 6 minutes. If that's to be believed, you go big boy, drinks on me anytime.Nicole went with the more conservative, but equally, if not more, delicious "Change." Somehow I managed to fit a few bites of her's in as well just for tasting purposes, and I really loved the mixture (yelp.com/biz_photos/dold) of the steak, onion rings and BBQ sauce, although I think the gouda is basically lost with all those other flavors going on.I honestly think this is one of those places where you can't go wrong no matter what you order, because the quality of the ingredients shines through, and the preparation is second to none. May your line always be long Ike, it is truly a sign of admiration in your case.
Best oozy gooey sandwiches ever. A decadent splurge!
This is as much a review of the food as it is the experience.Yes, their sandwiches are good, and the staff are friendly.However. . .I don't care if the sandwich causes me to be translated body and soul into heaven; a 1+hour wait in line with the most toxic of SF toxic hipsters is Just. Not. Worth. It.Victim of your own success I guess. And I noticed some of the residences nearby have KEEP THE F**K OUT spraypainted on the sidewalk in front (Ok maybe not in those exact words) but the only thing I can imagine less fun than waiting in line with those ineffable Dbags for an hour is living next to Ike's all the time.
Incredibly delicious sandwiches. And their complete menu is online - look it up before you go to really get all the options!
I'm was a bit hesitant when i came here. but man am i glad. this place is awesome. theres always a line but well worth the wait. i love the names they have for their sandwiches!
I have no problem finally admitting to everyone I know that I'm obsessed with this place. A friend of mine brought me to Ike's on their 4th anniversary (free half sandwiches), and all I can say is that night changed my life.Every time I know I'm about to go to Ike's, my pace quickens just a little; their sandwiches are out of this world, and it seems like everyone knows it. The line has always been long, but dear god the wait is worth every second. I always get the "[Name of Girl I'm Dating]" with the Funky Fusion chips and have never been disappointed. My friends tell me it looks like I'm about to cry with joy every time I pick up a sandwich from Ike's.
I would first like to say that Ike's is no ordinary sandwich spot. You are not going to find the simply delicious type sandwiches that you get from the corner liquor store. Ike's has some absolutely amazing sandwiches and some that are not so great. However, they are packed with meat and flavor. The service here is great. I like the new location way better than the one they had up the street a while back. I can come to this location and not find a ridiculously long line. The people are friendly and accommodating. I'm a pretty indecisive person and they are always super nice when I decide to switch my sandwich order last minute. The prices are pretty extreme here for a sandwich, but if you pick the right one it's totally worth the price. The bread is really good here, which is the foundation of a good sandwich. I don't normally like dutch crunch because of the excruciating pain I get on the roof of my mouth due to the jagged crunchiness on top. Ike's has wonderful dutch crunch bread, but I still stick to french roles. Spiffy Tiffy $9.99- Halal chicken, mushrooms, avocado, pesto, provolone and pepper jack cheese. Good flavor, but chicken was dry. I avoided their chicken for a while after that.Paul Reubens $9.99- Pastrami, home made poppy seed coleslaw, french dressing, and swiss cheese. 5 STARS!!! I absolutely love this sandwich!! The best reuben I have EVER had. The pastrami is not too dry, the flavor is absolutely superb, and they really are generous with the meat and poppy seed coleslaw, which balance out wonderfully. Definitely worth $10!!The Lincecum $11.11- One of their simpler sandwiches. Ham, turkey, bacon, avocado, and havarti cheese. Awesome combination! Backstabber $9.99- I decided to give the chicken a second chance. Halal chicken, marinated artichoke hearts, cesar, provolone cheese. YUM!! The chicken was not as dry this time and everything tasted so good together.Come here for the Paul Reubens! Try some others to see how you like them. This is my once in a while sandwich spot, definitely not somewhere I frequently get my sandwiches from. Still, Ike's is worth a try!
"You Like Ike!...I Like Ike! ...Everybody Likes Ike!"youtube.com/watch?v=va5BNo, I'm not trying to resuscitate the Draft Eisenhower movement, especially since he's been dead for 38 years...and he was a Republican after all. I'm joining the other bandwagon, the Yelpers who are raving about Ike's Place. He took over the sad little ice cream place, Sixteenth Sweets, that was there for about a minute. It's a very compact space, barely room for three little tables inside, but you can tell Ike's fan base is growing. The unsolicited compliments came fast and furious.I rarely rave about a sandwich maker, but I had the "16th and Market", one of over forty specialty sandwiches he personally prepares. It has chicken breast, fresh avocado, bits of real bacon and jack cheese. I'm not sure what he does with the chicken, but it wasn't merely a slab of poultry. It was chopped and mixed in some sort of tantalizing sauce (...could that be the "Dirty Sauce" oft-mentioned on the menu?). On a perfectly toasted Dutch Crunch roll with a truckload of lettuce, tomato slices, red onions, peppers and pickle slices, it was hearty and beyond tasty. It's $6.96...all the specialty sandwiches are $6.96.I was also convinced to get an order of their $1.99 fries - which are apparently baked, not fried. You could have fooled me. They were incredible with a lot of cayenne seasoning and with just the right consistency. And they even give you a Tootsie Pop. How can you not trust a place that gives you a Tootsie Pop? I lucked out because mine was chocolate all the way through.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xMFOOD - 5 stars...best sammies around, no kidding...Saigon Sandwiches, watch out!AMBIANCE - 4 stars...a tight space, but you can always take it to go and get out of my waySERVICE - 5 stars...super-friendly and every sandwich made to orderTOTAL - 5 stars...I Like Ike!
The sandwich was good, the wait and lack of seating are not.Some places become a victim of their own success, and I suspect that is what has occurred with Ike's. No doubt if all you are after is a good sandwich that you'll get it. You'll just be spending 15 minutes waiting for it in a small room with no place to eat it once you get it.
I know Ike's really doesn't need another glowing review, but it would be a shame not to review the BEST SANDWICH OF MY LIFE! Not sure if you all noticed, but I eat a lot, so that is quite the statement! The bread is amazing and the dirty sauce is outrageously good!Had my first Ike's sandwich last Thursday when a friend was visiting. She is a HUGE fan of Ike's and so she went there for dinner, and then brought me back the other half of her sandwich so I could eat it after work (so nice, I know). So by the time I had said sandwich, it was an hour old. I was in AWE. It was the Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian, and was filled with delicious mushrooms, peppercinis, cheese and an amazing, garlic-y pesto sauce. After each bite, I stopped and ruminated over how it was the best sandwich I had ever had.Fast forward 4 days. My friend was heading home and as her last meal in SF, she wanted Ike's! Woot woot! This time, I got to experience the hilarious, comedic staff that took our orders and entertained us while we waited for our sandwiches. I would give them 5 stars and pay to see them. They were awesome! I again had the Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian because it was THAT good, but one of our friends got the Mobile Momma with breaded fricken (fake chicken), provolone, hot sauce and ranch. I had a bite and it was also "FRICKIN" GOOD! I'm going to venture out and try other things on the menu next time:)Also, it's worth noting that if you go around 6-7 (I'm not sure when it starts or ends), they have "Happy Hour," which means they give you a free drink (not cheap canned soda's, either. In the words of TI, you can have whatever you'd like!) and a free bag of chips. They even let 2 of us who were sharing a sandwich have our own drink and our own bag of chips.Food + Service + clever sandwich names (don't want a MILF today? How about a Fat Bastard? Better yet, make him HELLA fat!) = 6 stars. Ike's is off-the-charts good!
Me standing in line for about 1.5 hours already, car drives by and girl screams "It's just a sandwich!!!". I had no idea I would be waiting in line for this long. By the time I finally got my sandwich, my friend and I waited a solid 2 hours. 2 HOURS! Seriously...Ike's Place is every business owner's dream come true. They've got the most loyal customers who are willing to wait this long for a sandwich. I have to admit though...the sandwich is that freaking good. They also give you a free bag of chips and a lollipop. You can call your order in advance and just pick it up. I would probably do that next time.
Best sandwiches in SF, hands-down! Had to try it after having seen it on man Vs food a few years ago. It was great, I was happy. My only complaint is that I wouldve liked a bigger sandwich.
My brother insisted that we go get a sandwich here when I was down in San Francisco. His wife told that I WOULD be getting the dirty sauce and that there was no ifs, ands, or buts about it. I read the menu, and the sandwiches I first wanted did not say dirty sauce in their ingredients, but I finally came upon the Papa Sam, that said it had dirty sauce in the ingredients.. I like salmon, especially on bread, and my name is Sam, so I decided to pick it. It was only after we had called in our order that I realized all sandwiches have dirty sauce regardless of whather they say so in their specific ingredients or not. So we drive down to the restaraunt, get our sandwiches and head over to the park across from Mission High School.The sandwich was pretty good. The taste was like a chord of flavor. No one flavor stood out, but when eaten they all came together to make a completely new full flavor. I am actually glad I didn't get one of the stronger sandiwches. The taste of the papa sam may have been a bit low key, but it was unique and very satisfying.
Yup Ike's didn't disappoint. I was a bit surprised at the prices (nothing under $7...most ranging between $9-$11) but once I took a bite, I couldn't complain. I had the Pride of Castro - ham, turkey & brie on wheat bread - SO good!! The sandwich was warm and just amazing to the last bite haha.It's basically a stall where you order at the entrance. A lot of people eat on the sidewalk right outside...no tables unfortunately. Also each sandwich comes with a bag of chips...so maybe that makes up for the price tag?? Either way, loved Ike's and can't wait to go back!
Happy Birthday Ike!Stopped by today and the gf got the usual Eli Manning, Can NEVER go wrong with that. I tried the Super Mario and I must say it's the best meatball sub I've ever had. Subway may have a $5 foot-long but I'd throw that off a cliff even if I'm on-the-verge-of-death-starving for another one of these. Dutch crunch, all beef meatballs, mozzarella sticks, and marinara sauce. It was divine!
Holy moly is this place so good! I ordered the Tom Brady on Dutch crunch. Omg it filled me up the whole day! Really big sandwich.
This place is crazy. Calling in for four sandwiches on a Saturday during noontime meant we couldn't pick them up until almost 2PM (or two hours later). If we had known that, BH, my gf, her bf, and I would've called at 10AM instead of at 12PM when we were all starving already.Not a problem - we decided to eat here for dinner, so while shopping at Bloomies, we called the place at 6 so we could pick up our sandwiches before closing. My gf and BH got the spiffy tiffy while I got the legend of zelda, and my gf's bf got another meatball sub (forgot the name).We all got our sandwiches on dutch crunch except for the friend's bf, who got his on sourdough. There was nowhere to sit outside, except for the opportunity to rub shoulders with a homie homeless, so we decided to take the sandwiches back to my gf's place in Emeryville. Bad mistake.The sandwiches were super soggy and the crunchy dutch crunch breads were almost ruined. But this isn't the reason why I gave such an okay rating - it's because I didn't think the sandwiches were that great to begin with flavor wise. The pesto in the spiffy tiffy was overwhelming, and the chicken meat was okay - not juicy or too tender. The meatballs were meaty and flavorful, but I think I got a bit of bone (or tooth?) in one of my meatballs (I spit it out and looked in horror at it  . .. but didn't mention it to anyone else in fear that they would lose their appetites as well - we had all been wanting to try this place for a while, and this was our chance!). Anyway, I would need to give this place another go, this time with a fresh sandwich between my lips right when I get it from the store. Maybe then, my rating will match everyone else's.
I came here twice in the past two weeks. It blows my mind how they use the same sandwich ingredients and make creations that are out of this world. I will spare everyone another long rave and just insist that you all visit. I always go at very weird times and have never had to really wait in line!
I've gone like 3 times and cannot stray from getting the menage a trois. Its hands down the best sandwich there. The dirty sauce is the kicker for all their sandwiches. I love the smoked gouda and bbq sauce in this sandwhich. The bread is nice and soft. I gotta say though I have not been to Ikes since they were featured on man vs. food and their business has BLOWN up. The lines are ridiculously long now and I would not wait that long toget a sandwich. I heard they might have to move because of the noise complaints from the neighbors. I hope they move to a bigger space with more seating and faster service with no lines. I'll keep my fingers crossed.
This place gets a lot of hype, but I feel that it's very well deserved. Every sandwich I've had here is one of the best I've ever had. They just really know how to do it right. It's also the first place I've ever had Dutch Crunch bread, and I wish every place had it! My two faves by far are:1) Manage-a-Trois- Halal Chicken Breast, Real Honey, Honey Mustard, BBQ, PepperJack, Swiss, Smoked Gouda on dutch crunch bread2) Going Home for Thanksgiving- Turkey, Cranberry, Sriracha, Havarti on dutch crunch. Also, their PB&J is fantastic...it's called the "Ooey Gooey and Louie". Huge, toasted, melted, and oozing with PB&J. Or try one of their other 100 awesome sandwiches. Seriously, there's like 100. Check their website. They're all good, but some are better than others. Anyone who thinks this place is overrated just hasn't found that one sandwich yet that rings their bell. They need to keep trying. Thanks Ike's for not giving up when your pissy neighbors couldn't handle your awesomeness. I'm sure they love that you're right around the corner now, HA!
I am reviewer #1702 for Ike's place. If that's not a testament of how delicious Ike's Place is, I don't know what is!The parking gods were with me -- found a spot upon arriving. The line seemed daunting, but nothing could stand in my way of the imminent goodness. Lovie was like, "There's one thing I don't do is wait in a line for anything." Perplexed, I said, "But you're waiting in a line right now." He said, "That's because I'm with you!" I love this guy.ANYWHO, despite waiting in line, we enjoyed every morsel of our sandwiches: his...an Eli Manning on wheat with soy cheese, mine...a Hot Mama Huda on dutch crunch. I loved how Ike handed our sandwich to us. We met him once at Unwrapped 2009...I wasn't surprised he didn't recognize us. It's like asking Barry Zito if he remembers meeting me 5 years ago (oh how I wish he remembered!) I couldn't finish half of my sandwich it was so big. On the ride home, I accidentally sat on it the whole time. The juices were all over my car seat and the left side of my butt was soaked. Needless to say, I turned my sandwich into a panini.Sidenote: You know it's a cold day in SF when Ike is wearing a beanie :-)
The sandwiches here are awesome. I ordered the Kryptonite and the sandwich was huge. It was good and had just about everything from the kitchen in it, lol.
Pretty darn good sandwiches.We came here after hearing rave reviews. Despite coming around 11 on a random weekday, we still had to wait at 10-15 minutes to put in our order/pay and then wait for it. I didn't know this, but apparently the wait is so long because they bake the bread right when you order it (or the website says that anyway).So my friend and I split the Menage a Trois. I ordered it just cuz the 7x7 list recommended it without even knowing what it is but it's halal chicken breast with honey, BBQ sauce, honey mustard, pepperjack, gouda, and swiss. (oh man, even typing the ingredients makes my mouth water. ugh). We ordered it on dutch crunch, but weirdly our order got swapped with my friend's (Marcus L.) who ordered before us. So we got the sandwich on sourdough instead, which made me a little sad, but the sandwich was still amazing. The sauces mix together so that you don't know what distinctively you're eating, but it's so amazing, you don't really care anyway. And 3 cheeses melted together... who can say no to that. It comes with dirty chips and a caramel apple lollipop (what a nostalgic trip!).Kinda pricey for the size of the sandwich (~$12 after tax) and it wasn't the most amazing sandwich I've had in my life, but it was still pretty good. I think the wait kills it a little bit... worth a shot if you're looking for some specialty sandwiches!
5 stars is very generous considering the hour wait it took to even get my sandwich. However, for reasons to be mentioned shortly, and because I sort of knew what I was getting myself into from other yelp reviews about going here in the peak lunch hours, they deserve all 5.I was explaining to my boyfriend, while eating, that this sandwich and the process of ordering/receiving it was like this rollercoaster of emotions. Raving reviews- up. Line out the door upon arrival- down. Menu of very delicious sandwiches- up. Wow, we are STILL waiting (45 min. total in the end)- down. Yay, we are finally at the front AND the girl taking our order is really nice- up. Eff this, we still have to wait for it to be made- down. Ohhhh but our sandwich comes with chips- up. Man, it's been 15 minutes- down. Yay, it's done- up. Shoot, nowhere to dine in, so we have to take it back to our hotel room- down. Finally eating it....................LOOPS AND LOOPS AND LOOPS! amazing. this shiz is the bomb.I had the Sesame street sandwich and, let me just say, pesto and cream cheese together in a sandwich with veggies between soft and buttery wheat bread is sort of a beautiful thing. i almost couldn't even comprehend its deliciousness. even though we had to wait an hour, it was sort of like giving birth, because i totally forgot the agony once I ate (and even moreso now that a day has passed). don't get me wrong, i've definitely never given birth, but i imagine that is what it's like. point being- just call in your order...i wish i had, but even if you don't, you're in for a big treat.
Great hot sandwiches, Menage a Trios is my favorite. If you're looking for quality cold cut sandwich though, you'll probably want to stick to one of the many awesome Italian deli's around the city.
I've been to Ike's twice now and each time it ha been absolutely amazing. Their sandwiches are varied and creative with a distinctive taste to each one. The first sandwich I had was "The Love Triangle" which was vegan chicken, real honey, honey mustard, BBQ sauce, pepper jack, Swiss and Gouda. It was, of course amazing. At first I was worried it would just be a huge mess of flavors but it wasn't. I was able to taste all of the different flavors of all the sauces and cheeses. Another great thing about this sandwich was its ability to mask the flavor of the vegan chicken. While it was better than most fake chicken I've had, vegan chicken usually has a strange and distinct flavor/texture. Luckily all of the sauces and cheese and veggies hide that very well and it was like I was eating the real thing.The second sandwich was The Gramps which sounds simple with just vegan steak, provolone and grilled mushrooms, but its how it's put together which makes it just brilliant. It was filled with Ike's Dirty Sauce which gave me a chance to finally try it (since I couldn't really find it in The Love Triangle). Again, you can taste all of the flavors in the sandwich, especially the mushrooms which really held together well. The main piece of this sandwich however was the vegan steak which was absolutely fantastic. I don't know what's in it, but it was perfect.During my last visit they did have some troubles with their register or something and they actually lost a friend's receipt which had her and a few other people waiting for more than 30 minutes...it was strange since it seemed like most people in the kitchen were just walking around not really doing anything. However, they tried to alleviate the tension by giving us a trivia game which was pretty entertaining..albeit impossible. But still, the rest of that experience wasn't very good and it was disappointing.I've heard a lot of comparisons between Ike's Place and Little Luca's and this is my opinion on that: Both are amazing in their own way. -Little Luca's is the absolute best sandwich place for simple (extremely large) sandwiches for a great price. Their garlic spread is the best ever and it deserves all types of recognition. -Ike's Place however is the absolute best in creativity and variation. I consider Ike's to be more of a dessert sandwich shop since every single bite is sweet and delicious. Ike's Place is amazing and you should definitely check it out if you haven't yet. There's literally a sandwich for everyone here. The vegetarian and vegan selections are also very welcome since it's one of the largest selections I've seen at a sandwich spot for non-meat eaters.You also get a free lollipop with each purchase. Now you want to go, right?
I can't stop thinking about how great the menage a trois was, I honestly think it may have been the best sandwich I have ever had in my life. The dutch crunch was just perfect. The dirty sauce and all the ingredients created an orgasm in my mouth.Thanks to yelpers I followed their advice and called in my order in advance and tried some of the yummy pop in the glass and this place did not disappoint. I came around 1:30pm to miss the lunch rush.I wish they had more of Ike's where I live in socal. This place is a gem!
Too much hype, unfortunately I didn't like my sandwich =( Service= was very good, the two stars are for you! =)Either the Halal chicken or the sauces or both where waaaaay too salty in my Hot Momma Hudda ... For those people who will be reviewing this place, please post what type of sandwich you had, maybe i need to try "the one" that everybody is raving about...Maybe next time Ike...
This place is completely overpriced for what it is. They have novelty sandwiches, but is it really worth paying $20 for a sandwich? I've always felt this way about Ike's but get suckered into going with friends. The newest "piss me off" was that I wanted to place an order for a sandwich because of the scoutmob, but the guy basically hung up on me when I tried ordering for pickup over the phone. Rude. Last time I was there, I tried ordering 2 different sandwiches but they didn't have ingredients for these 2 completely different sandwiches. The lines are long. The service sucks. Ike has a knack for picking the crappiest locations for his business, probably to save on expenses. The blind word-of-mouth pawns will probably disagree with me, but I'm over this place.
I wish i had this place in my city! On vacation and had to get a sandwich here. Got the cougar! Cant remember what was on it because i ate the damn thing so fast. They have so many choices. It is very hard to decide what you want. 10 bucks a sandwich but hey on vacation. You must go though! There are no tables, chairs or seating to eat. This is a take out only. Go to the park a couple of blocks away and eat.
Over 2000 reviews, and 4-and-a-half stars. We are talking about the quality of the food here. I agree with my fellow Yelpers. The long line raised my expectations even more. It was not a very pleasant wait. We had to wait for the menu to be passed along to the back and then we were constantly shuffled closer to the building walls so that we would not block the residential sidewalks. Then after we ordered, we got to the other side of the line and waited there for the food to be made. But I was in good company, so it didn't bother me too much. Expect a line at any hour. That's why you can CALL IN AHEAD OF TIME and pick it up later! Look through the menu because it is huge. I can go back to this place everyday for a month and still probably won't be able to finish trying all the items that appeal to me. Yep, good eats. Yes, wheat is healthier, but the dutch crunch has great texture--just try it!
I can't believe this place is walking distance from my apartment and I didn't know about it until recently. FML.Ike's Place is pretty awesome. They're a trendy little sandwich place tucked into what almost looks like a converted street-side apartment that serves some tasty, tasty pickings. Unlike other eateries in the neighborhood (there are plenty on Market Street over on the next block), at Ike's you pretty much order, wait, grab, go, eat, and enjoy. There's no sitting around - as there's no place to sit other than the sidewalk - and no spending half an hour browsing through a menu - as there's only ONE real copy and everyone would get mad if you took that long. There's just a line and a cashier standing just outside the entrance, shouting orders into the kitchen.The menu itself is pretty massive. There are over 100 different sandwiches listed, each with a funny, interesting name like the Nacho Boy, Super Mario, Change, Menage-a-Trois, or the aptly named Doomsday. Most are pretty cheap, around $7, with some of the more expensive sandwiches going up to about $15 or so. Not bad considering how big they are. Tons of variety, tons of condiments at your demand, and an explosion of flavor in every bite.The staff is cool. It seems like this place is run by hip young twenty-somethings, and those seem to be the kind of people you see in line on regular basis. They seem to joke around a lot, handle the long lines efficiently, and churn out deliciousness like an assembly line.Seriously, what more could you want in a sandwich place? Oh look, it's almost lunchtime... think I'll take a walk up the street.
What can I say about Ike's that hasn't been captured in their over 2,000 reviews? Not much really. Their sandwiches will make your mouth orgasm and leave you wanting more. So far I've tried the Lincecum and the Napolean Complex. I suppose around $10 a pop for a sandwich one might reconsider, but it's really worth it. I think the most helpful advice I could provide is to call in your order (probably best to call in the morning if you want to pick up around lunch). I pity the fool who waits in line. Do it. Call Ike now. (415)553-6888!
If there was 10 more stars I can add, I would do so in a heart beat. Way worth the wait for an amazing sandwich. you will never see sandwiches the same way again. Manage-A-Trois, are you kidding me? best sammich I've ever had, and I have many more to try. Lines can be long, but there is no line worth waiting for. Ike, the owner is extremely passionate and appreciate his customers. Always in the trenches and open to hearing people's ideas. I've never met an owners so humble and passionate about his customers. First class guy for sure. Follow up on twitter as he sends out last minute deals and info..
Ike's has a sandwich named after a Siouxsie song: Christine the Strawberry Girl! Kudos to Ike for his creative sandwich combos, stellar sandwich making skills, and his ability to satisfy carnivores, vegetarians, and vegans alike. He offers a wide range of sandwiches with names like Pride of Castro, 16th & Market, Montana to Rice, Backstabber, SexyBoy, etc. Plus he has breakfast sandwiches, salads, espresso drinks, ice cream, ice cream floats, milkshakes...AND he gives you a TOOTSIE ROLL POP for dessert. I had the "Flipper" which is the favorite sandwich of Ike's female assistant (Mother? Muse?): Tuna salad, avocado, American cheese on a toasted garlic French roll. Hefty, delicious sandwich with generous amounts of veggies (lettuce, ripe tomato, avocado). The creaminess of the avocado complemented the creamy tuna salad. The lettuce was still crunchy (it's often soggy at other sandwich shops). The garlic roll was chewy and very flavorful. Personally I think it would be even better with some red onion and chopped celery. I might skip the garlic roll because it was such a strong flavor that it overwhelmed the other sandwich elements. Ike can make a vegan version of this and all meat sandwiches. I've never had vegan "tuna" - wonder what it's like?I liked the seasoning on the spicy "guilt-free" baked fries, $1.99, (had cayenne) but the fries weren't even slightly crispy (I've had crispy baked fries before). They were still pretty good though. It's a tiny space with only three tables but it's a warm space because Ike and his assistant are so sweet. Next time I'm going to go all out for the vegan "meat" combo with soy cheese and vegan mayo.  After that, it's the turkey burger. The variety (number of sandwich types) was a bit overwhelming at first but now I can't wait to go back and work my way through the menu. Ike says the vegan meatball and #9 insert the name of the girl you're dating chicken sandwich are his customer favorites. If you visit his my space page, you can view the menu and not feel so overwhelmed by all the original sandwiches he offers.Update: I went back for the meatless vegan meatball sandwich. It's the best vegan/veg sandwich I've ever had. The pickles complement the meatless meatballs and the sauces are finger licking good. Messy yes, and almost $8, but it's a special sandwich that's worth it.
Big fan of sandwiches and this is probably my FAVORITE! I only recently found this place and wish that they had a location in New York. They have an iphone app to place orders, and if you don't want to wait 40 minutes to order then another hour to get the food, then place your orders BEFORE you go. You can place an order online or via your app. The new location is great, mimosa's while you are waiting is never a bad thing.Suggestion:menage a troi
My friends hyped this place up for a good 3 months before I actually got my butt over here. I have been here twice in the past month. First, I tried the Mena ja trois and the second time I had the Count of Monte Cristo. Their sandwiches are alright, but I think everyone hyped it up too much for me. They do have very creative names and concoctions, I will give them that. There aren't many shops like this around. However, they are super heavy and oily. Not something I ever have an irresistible craving for but would probably try again.
Oh. My. God. Sin on sourdough. My life is no longer the same. I have experienced the results of throwing caution to the wind, abandoning the trappings of California cuisine.Who is to say you can't put stuffed jalapeno poppers and fried mozzarella sticks in a meatball sub? Why not eat a MILF in public? Go. Eat. Be happy.
The best sandwiches in the city!! If you don't want to wait though, call in your order. Everything I have tried has been fantastik. The people that work there are usually fast and friendly.
So I was hanging out in the City and I went to go grab a sandwich at this place called ike's. I went there with a girl and a guy. The name of the girl I'm dating is going to remain a secret, but she's a nice one, tasty as well, she's gone around the block a few times, everybody knows who she is, but dont get me started, sometimes it's good to try what everyone else has tried to see what all the fuss is about right? Then theres the guy, the dude loves to eat... I'm talkin one hella fat bastard. He's a saucy son of a bitch and likes to play dirty too if ya know what I'm sayin. He may not be as popular as the girl, but he's definitely worth knowing. They were both dutch by the way and I'm glad they were.So anyways, we went up to the worker and said what's up, fo shizzle, yo, the pizzle. Word. Now my pizzle foshizzle was the bomb dizzle if ya knizzle what im sizzle. ya dig?
Prob the best sandwiches I have ever had. Tried 2: -Not Tonight, I have a Headache-Nacho Boythe first one was ok, I'm not a HUGE fan of bbq sauce, but it was good nonetheless. The Nacho Boy--HOLY HELL it was amazing. So good, I wish I could eat it forever. The meat was perfect, and there was the perfect amount of sauce. The toasted bread wasn't too hard or too soft, and everything just melted in my mouth. So sad it's so far from me, but this place is worth the drive! Will be back soon! FYI, There is no seating, so I ate it in my car with my friend--I can't wait to try more of their sandwiches!
Ordered the nacho boy sandwich on french bread....it was the bee's knees baby.Girlfriend ordered the spiffy tiffy on sourdough and she said it was the best sandwich she's ever had.Definitely recommend that you try this place once in your life.
Very delicious sandwiches. Can't really go wrong with their menu, and the name of the sandwiches is quite entertaining and reasonable prices. Only complaints are the long lines and the poor seating, but does that warrant fewer stars? No no it doesn't, stop being so hypercritical.
After hearing all the good things about Ike's from my buddy Rick and the yelping community, I decide to hit it up and see what the fuss is all about. Maybe my expectations were a bit high due to all the great review this place got, but personally I think it's overrated. The sandwich is just OK, it's not bad, but it's also not what people made it out to be.
Bomb dot com.That's all there is to say. I mean there are enough rave reviews. Just go here and you'll quickly find out why.
THE place to go for your sandwich fix in San Francisco. This place has ridiculous lines around the clock for a reason; phone your order in and save yourself a half-hour wait! These babies are best eaten fresh out of the kitchen, since the ingredients have a tendency to melt together into an unidentifiable jumble if you let them sit too long. That's not a bad thing, but certain items like onion rings and pickles usually taste better when they've still got some crunch.We've run into the occasional incorrect order (we tend to order for the whole office when we go), but Ike's staff is always super friendly and accommodating: they'll replace the sandwich on the spot, no questions asked.I've never had a bad meal here.
I have dreams about Ike's sandwiches! Sweet, sweet dreams.
Believe the hype. The sandwiches are amazing. Got the MILF on Dutch Crunch and it was delicious... no, no, it was like a religious experience! It was better than sex!! What drew me to this particular sandwich was the inclusion of jalapeno poppers! If you already like cheese and jalapenos on your sandwiches, this works out awesomely. It's not at all weird or even gluttonous, since there isn't aren't any cheese slices on this one. Fatty justification. Heehee. The other ingredients: Halal chicken, Frank's Red Hot, and ranch were great too and worked together just fine. The location is a bit odd (because it's inside of a lounge/restaurant) and admittedly, hard to find. There is no Ike's signage anywhere on the storefront. My only indication that we were at the right spot were the people eating their sandwiches right in front of the window. Also, it's a little tight with the Lime patrons coming in while all the Ike's customers are lined out the door, but the nice bubbly girl working the register moved the line along at a decent pace. After you've completed your order, just get out the way and wait outside. I personally didn't wait too long before my order was brought out to me. Based on this first experience alone, I am a fan. Hope to return or to hit up their other locations. There's one coming to SJSU soon!!
After my first visit I told my husband that I didn't care to go back to Ike's but I was so wrong! We went to Ike's on Valentines day very hungover to get some food. We got there around 11ish and the line wasn't bad but it was super long by noon. We were lucky enough to have a nice chat with Ike himself because one of our friends knows him very well. He is a very nice guy and I felt bad about the low ratings I gave on my first review!This time I had the fat bastard on dutch crunch with jalapenos which has extra dirty sauce, american cheese, bacon, ham and all the other fixings. It was AMAZING. OMG! The cheese was melted to perfection, the bacon and ham were so delicous, not overpowering at all! & I finally got to taste the dirty sauce because it wasn't being masked by hot sauce or ranch like last time. I will go back to Ike's and stick with the fat bastard because its the most delicious sandwich at Ike's!
Strengths: The sandwiches are GOOD. I ordered the Purple...something (its a CABLT with fake bacon....that tastes and looks like BACON!!!!) The menu is entertaining. The service is friendly.Weaknesses: The wait is LONG. It look us an hour to get to order, another 15 minutes after the order. There is no where to sit; the chairs and tables shown on the pics were not there when I was....Opportunities: I say take cash only, eliminate the time it takes to ring ppl and more profit for Ike, good for cash carriers like me...lol. Or have a cash line. And what's up with these phone orders? Stop that. Make everyone wait in line to show their devotion...lol.Threats: I gotta say I will go to Roxie's next time unless I have two hours to spare.Total: $25 for two sandwiches and two drinks and two lovely lollipops.
I don't mean to hate on all the glowing reviews. For me this place is "A-OK". I like how Ike is super friendly. When your order is ready he will literally run the sandwich over to you, give you a high five, and congratulate you on picking such an awesome sandwich. With that said, In my opinion the sandwiches are way to saucy. With all the dirty sauce and any other condiments I start getting queasy once I finish about half the sandwich. The portion sizes are generous but, I can never finish the thing. With all the sauce it's not like you can really save it for later without getting soggy. This place is also a little overpriced. For two sandwiches with drinks I paid almost $30. Like others have mentioned the wait in line and after you order is usually crazy long.So yeah, the sandwiches are pretty good overall. I come by every once in a while. Just not my thing when there are other great sandwich shops nearby.
Great sandwiches, huge menu. Also can build your own if too overwhelming. Dutch crunch bread is so good.
Mmm, tasty. If a sandwich heaven existed, I would imagine it to be just like Ike's Place.The lines can get pretty long. So if you're really impatient, if you read the menu online beforehand you can call in your order like 15 minutes before you want to pick it up to minimize your wait. Though, the fun part of the whole experience kind of is the line so if it's your first time - suck it up and endure the line, it's not that bad. An abbreviated version of the menu is presented in the front window, but be sure to scope out the actual full menu that tends to float around in the line. The +100 options of sandwiches can be overwhelming, but you will hate yourself if you don't account for all of your options before ordering.Thus far, I've tasted three of the sandwiches. (Note: This is not a place to take a first date - the sandwiches can get super messy. Not so sexy when trying to make a first impression.) The Joker, is said to be Ike's favorite. I attempted to place my order for this sandwich with wheat bread, but the very helpful staff insisted that I reconsider dutch crunch - so I did and it was a good call. The extra crunch factor of the bread added an extra level of texture to mesh with the flavor party created with the meatballs, red pesto and zucchini.The Menage a Trois is said to be the most popular selling sandwich that features a mixtures of three tasty cheeses - pepper jack, swiss and smoked gouda. Mixed in with the shredded Halal chicken breast, this too is one delicious sandwich. *Spoiler Alert: This is a juicy one - literally, so if you aren't eating it at home, bring some wet wipes!*The Stupid Eggplant sandwich was like eating eggplant parm in between a wedge of bread. A good vegetarian option. Add the caramelized onions on this order. To better break up the flavors, I wish this sandwich had some spinach in it - but overall it was decent.Optimal sandwich eating tip - eat it asap after you've picked it up or it will get soggy and not up to its full potential.Lastly, as if the sandwich wasn't already awesome enough - packed inside that paper bag is a Caramel Apple Pop for dessert! A nice and memorable touch. I even witnessed Ike himself telling a customer's friend who did not order a sandwich that, "no one should leave here (Ike's Place) without something" as Ike handed the customer's friend a Caramel Apple Pop. Sometimes it's the little things that make all the difference.
Ike's Place sandwiches rule. Clearly this is confirmed by the thousands of reviews before mine, but hey, what the helllll! Here goes nothing.I tried both the [Name of the Girl I'm Dating] as well as Menage a Trois and really liked both. The sandwiches are HUGE and incredibly satisfying. They also cater to the eating needs of different people (i.e vegans) which is hard to come by with places that are so popular.Can be considered to be a little pricey for some ($30 for 2 orders), but worth every penny. Line was out the door, but moved very fast. We only waited about 5 minutes to get our food. No indoor seating.Can't wait to come back for more!
This place is ri-dic-u-lous! Seriously, the best and biggest sandwiches ever! Definitely order anything on dutch crunch with the dirty sauce. You will NOT be disappointed. I've only been here once, but my bf and I order to go and ate our sandwiches in Dolores park. I don't eat sandwiches that often, but if I ever have a craving, I will definitely be going to IKES PLACE! YUM!
I know every raves about their meatless sandwiches, but rest assured, their meatful sandwiches are just as good!JONASAPPROVED!
I am a sandwich hater. I usually try to avoid eating sandwiches at all cost, since I am not a fan. With all of my griping above... Ike's changed my mind and turned me into a fan. I live fairly close and always drive by and see the enormous line. Today, I ventured there at 2pm and the line was fairly short, and I finally got to experience all of the hype.I ordered the Lizzy's Lips with Avocado. It was heavenly. All of the flavors and that crack sauce worked so well together. Plus, the sourdough bread was crunchy and simply perfection. I adore how they take the time to get your order right. The staff is so happy, it seems like they actually enjoy their jobs, the chips are free and the caramel apple pop... is just the icing on the cake. I really can't say enough about this place.I can't wait to go back.. and those neighbors should hush up, and feel fortunate to live next to such an establishment.
Service: The people that work there are super friendly! They take your order and always make sure they get it right.Food: YUMMY! The first time i came here we waited an hour and a half for the sandwich and let me tell you, it was worth it! I recommend the name of the girl im dating. The dirty sauce is AHHH-mazing and so is the bread. I recommend the dutch crunch bread. These sandwiches are huge so if you dont want to stuff ur face till u tip over you and a girlfriend could share one and be super full. You might have to unbutton one of your pant buttons after. ;)Restaurant: The downside is the wait outside that usually goes around the building but hey it's SF and the weather is beautiful :) Too bad they are leaving SF. If anything, go to their other locations.. i'm sure it will be just as ahhhh-mazing :)my advice: Call in your order first then go to pick up the sandwich to avoid the wait..i will definitely do that the next time i go.
I had heard that this place was the best of the best. After seeing it on Man vs. Food, the BF decided it was time to take me to Ike's. As we walked to the small and rather unassuming restaurant, I saw a line out the door and literally made a frowny face. And this is not a little line, this is like 20-30 people deep, standing outside, just waiting to order their sandwich. You made me walk like1.5 miles when I am practically dying of hunger and there is a damn line? Really? Oh this sandwich better give me an orgasm or something.Well you lucked out Ike, because it was just that good, I can forgive you. I don't like meat, and well I don't like fake meat, it's a texture thing not a moral thing. So the fact that you have like two pages of vegetarian sandwiches, many of which contain no meat or meat like products makes me smile. I decided to go with The Strawberry Girl on Dutch crunch bread with almost everything on it and loads of onions.... My body tingles just thinking about it right now. Mmmmmm... crunch bread... So I leave you with this Ike, how about you open one of your awesome little sandwich shops in LA? I mean there are loads of hungry people here in LA that would go bat crazy over your food. Hey I will even quit my job and work there, as long as I get all the free sandwiches I can eat :)
like Ike's need another 5 star review but I can't help myself as I think about the sandwich. First off, I love how their menu is split amongst vegan, vegetarian and regular. second of all, the SAUCE! What is in that sauce??  #1/2, Spiffy Tiffy - Halal Chicken breasts, mushrooms, pesto, mushrooms, provolone, pepper jack, and of course, avocado. :) All these sound great right? But add that dirty sauce with lettuce, onion, tomatoes, red onion, banana peppers and you have yourself a sandwich that will have you smiling from ear to ear after the first bite. #100, Eli Manning - Halal Chicken Breasts, Zesty Garlic and Herb Sauce, Mushrooms, avocado, cheddar cheese. I called in before I went to go pick the sandwich up and the guy was kind enough to do chicken and no chicken on the other half of the sandwich. Whether you live in the city or you are out of town, this is one of the must-try spots if you are in San Francisco. Must. Try. Repeat. Must. Try.
My boyfriend and I came here last weekend after having Roxie's the weekend before. People say Ike's is better than Roxie's because of their dirty sauce and variety of sandwiches. However, both my bf and I liked Roxie's more. We called and ordered the Superman to share because we heard it was 2 sandwiches. When we got there, there was no line and barely anyone inside. We paid at the front, got our bag of chips, and sat down at a couch to wait for our sandwich to come out. While waiting, we had the bag dirty chips, which was really salty. When the sandwich came, it came in 2 whole sandwiches. There was a lot of meat inside, but the water from the meat made the whole sandwich kind of too soggy. I had about 3/4 of my sandwich and gave the rest to my bf. Maybe next time, I need to order it with dutch crunch because I love dutch crunch! I forgot to tell them.
There's nothing I could possibly say about a place with over 4200 reviews that would be new or groundbreaking. So instead, I'll tell you what I like. Every sandwich I've had here is excellent. Those include the Tony Soprano, the Matt Cain, and the Pizzle. I know I've tried others, but these are the ones that come to mind right away. Dutch crunch bread is amazing. I've been tempted to branch out and try something else, but I always get lured back in at the last minute. And finally, I love that the sandwiches are drenched with sauce. Some people might not like this as it tends to be messy and might drown out some of the other flavors on the sandwich, but I have no problem with it. If you want to enjoy the subtle notes in your cheese or contemplate the aging process of the meats, go elsewhere.The sandwiches here are pricey, but so is everything in SF. And they're not priced unreasonably when you realize that they're generously sized and include the price of a bag of chips and a caramel apple lollipop. In the couple of years we've been hitting up Ike's on our trips into the city, they've moved locations and vastly improved their wait times. I'm not sure if the new location is bigger, but it's certainly more efficient. The current location even has limited seating inside if you're really worried about finding a place to eat or don't want to sit in your car. When I say limited, I mean there's seating for maybe 10 people though, so don't get your hopes up on finding a chair during a rush. They used to have a handful of ratty paper menus that would get passed back through the line, but those were nowhere to be found on our most recent visit. Instead, they had a chalkboard with some of their sandwiches hung up behind the counter. If this is your first visit though, don't be fooled! There are tons more options where those came from. They have a smartphone app with the full menu, so if you're standing in line and want to peruse the entire menu, or can't read the board, make sure to download the app or go with a friend who has it.If you're driving to Ike's be prepared to have a hard time finding parking. You'll probably have to make a couple of passes down the neighboring streets before you'll find an open spot. Even though it's a hassle to get to and order at Ike's, the sandwiches are well worth the effort.
The redhead at the door was super sweet without sacrificing authenticity or efficiency, and the sando was pretty fly too. Suck it up and wait in line, or go elsewhere, but don't bitch about it.Keywords: dutch crunch, dirty sauce, call ahead
This place is legit. Menage A Trois was amazing. My wife and I split it, and I regretted it after the 1st bite! The Voodoo chips are the way to go (Zapp's brand out of Louisiana). Could have done without the Leninade, which just didn't work for me.
Get ready to stand in line with a bunch of silicon valley twats, this place is officially a tourist destination...but it'll be worth it. Great saucy messy sandwiches and a good amount of vegetarian options. Not much seating, so go on a nice day and take your sandwich to the park.
that secret sauce is orgasmic soooo going back
Some of my best afternoon naps have come after I consume one of Ike's sandwiches. So not only are they good, they make me happy and sleepy after, pretty good right? I've tried the menage tois and the Evelyn (#9) and both were very good. We took it home to eat and by that time the bread was nice and soggy..mmmm but made it harder to eat. I'm curious to try out their new location in Palo Alto since I'll be working nearby soon.
Great food ans atmosphere. I frequent Lime quite often for brunch on Sunday's. The lunch deli crowd is a whole different animal. Aside from the occasional weirdo it makes for a pleasant dining experience. Please turn on the heat and close the front door!
With its temporary site at the Lime nightclub, getting a sandwich can be kind of awkward on the weekends. It is filled with people out having a good time in the bar dancing to the loud music. And then there's the people standing around outside looking in at the revelers waiting for their sandwich.I was in the group waiting for my "Thanksgiving Day" and throughly confused that dance party could happen at 2 in the afternoon on a Saturday. But with the sandwiches being tasty, I suppose its worth the awkwardness
WOWO. THE BEST SANDWICH I HAVE EVER EATEN= MENAGE A TROIS avec bacon. literally the BEST SANDWICH EVER. just a perfect amount of sweet . and just downright beautiful. I have come here twice in the last week (and I don't live close) as a result of this phenomenal sandwich and hope to be buried with 50 of these sandwiches in my coffin. As for the location- I like that its close to market I wish there was seating at the place so I don't have to go around to the neighboring cafes and awkwardly sit down with my brown paper bag. The drink selection is great I have found one of the best ginger ales here. The chips are an added bonus (out of the three that I have tasted to far (in order of preference)- Funky Fusion- Jalapenos- SaltedTIP- The two times that I have come here, I have come around 12/12:30 and it has been surprisingly empty (no line), but after an hour the line goes out the door and the wait seems pretty bad. SO my tip is go around 12/12:30
The best sandwiches in SF, my friends from out of town who've had them reminisce about them and can't wait to come back! The line is a bit of crap shoot but most of that problem is solved by the new place and the time waiting for sandwiches has been cut down significantly also. Ike, Chase, Yael, Alex, and all the rest are super nice. Only complaint is lack of extended menus on hand so if you don't have a smartphone then you won't know the gamut of sandwich glory.
We get sandwiches from here for company lunch meetings often. My sandwich always comes as a soggy mess. Kind of disgusting actually. What a let down. Probably would be great if you get it and eat it right away, but alas, I don't have that luxury since I don't work close by.
The sandwiches are good, but honestly. Seriously. WHY SUCH A LONG WAIT? This is a sandwich, not a slow roasted prime rib. The worst is calling in an order and being told it will be THREE HOURS before they next "pick up time" is available. What are they doing in there, for pete's sake?I hate to say it, but this is the one and only reason I have not been back to Ike's and probably will not be back. I can't wait in line an hour each time, and I can't be told to wait four hours for a call in order.
Don't really need to say much when this place already has 3,000+ reviews! My friend, Patrick P., suggested that we call in to place our orders because the wait is ridiculous. I didn't know Ike's was so popular, but I found out later on that it was featured on Man Vs. Food. We arrived at Ike's about 30 minutes after calling in, and there was a HUGE crowd outside. Fortunately for us, we were able to get our food right away. It was like using fast passes at Disneyland. :D The sandwiches were all really good. They were flavorful and the bread was crunchy, but not too hard on the outside. I really liked the chips that came with the sandwiches, and the Caramel Apple Pops were just the cherry on top for me. If the weather permits, I'd definitely recommend getting your sandwiches to go and taking them for a picnic at Dolores Park. :)
Believe the hype folks. I don't know what magic was in the Paul's Reuben, but it was the best sandwich I have ever had. That's right. And I have had a lot of delicious sandwiches, my friends, and even more mediocre and bad ones. Might it have been the deliciously spiced pastrami? Or the sauce? I don't know, but the combo was perfect.My husband had the manage a trois, which I think deserves 4 stars and not 5, but hey. We're splitting hairs here.
I had to take advantage of being in San Francisco and the TVFoodmaps app, so I had to try this place. Smaller menu inside than what's on the web, but Amazing. I don't know how people are saying the food is not worth the price? Per some other recommendations, I tried the spiffy tiffy. 10 bucks for a big ass awesome sandwich on that delicious roll with flavors that went together great. Those voodoo chips were great as well. I want to come back to this place every time I come up to San Francisco. Sandwiches are my favorite food, and this place is definitely one of my top sandwich shops in America. Good stuff!
Bread baked fresh! "Dirty sauce" baked INTO the bread is quite unique. Order the dutch crunch!Service was excellent: the person who took our order gave us great recommendations and definitely knew the menu well.The Menage a Tois was a bit messy on the sauce, but still lip smackin' good :) Too bad it'll be gone soon...
They're always out of Dutch Crunch bread! Besides that I think we all know they're the best sandwiches in the city. Unique sandwiches and personal touches like the caramel apple lollipop make them awesome and stand out from all the other sandwich shops in sf.
Really? Is a sandwich from Ike's really worth waiting for an hour in line? Seriously? Short answer: Fuck, yes.Let me be clear, I hate, HATE, waiting in line, but for another "Hella Fat Bastard", I will happily stand out in a blizzard, for two hours, with the Castro/Mission hipsters. I don't know if they put crack in that dirty sauce, or something, but man, I can't get it outta my mind.....
Awesome spot. The sandwiches they offer in the store are only a fraction of the menu. Check the website for a full list.Bread is always chewy with a crisp toasted crust. All around really tasty.
Mnage  trois on the french roll.MINDZ WERE BLOWN!
Morgan Spurlock's "Super Size Me" was comically alarming and literally sickening if not obvious in exploring one step-by-step approach on how to grow a sweaty couch potato. Netflix. 3 stars. But the how-to-be-a-piggy documentary part two I really want to see is "Ike's Me" which follows a strapping young lad or sturdy miss (TBD) who suffers relentlessly in line HOURS a DAY, EVERYDAY to order a sandwich for brunch, late lunch, then dinner, chipping down the impossible and permutably vast menu like the way molasses settles on a spoon. This role automatically disqualifies me because apparently I just can't get past the Eli Manning because is it that good and because I already have a full-time job. Who's up for the challenge?
My brother and his friend introduced me to Ike's Place, and I'm SO HAPPY that they did. You know the place is good when people are willing to stand outside in a long-ass line to wait for a sandwich. We considered calling our order in for pickup while we were standing in line, but by the time we came up with that bright idea, we were getting close to the front of the line. Definitely worth the wait.Their menu is SO LONG. I also love that they cater to so many different people. There are a ton of sandwiches that are vegetarian or have halal meat. Always nice to see.I was going to have the Fat Bastard, but since I was splitting the sandwich with my brother and I was on vacation, I opted for the HELLA FAT BASTARD - ham, bacon, American cheese, extra dirty sauce, mozzarella sticks on dutch crunch bread. A sandwich with MOZZARELLA STICKS on it?! Are you kidding me?! Hell yes. I'm not sure what the dirty sauce is made of, but it's pretty flavorful and tasty. I also didn't realize you get to pick the bread, so I asked which one was most popular and was pleased with my choice of the dutch crunch bread.I wish there were an Ike's Place in Chicago, but I guess I'll just have to dream about my Hella Fat Bastard and visit the next time I'm in San Francisco.
1 star because I can't do negatives.I hate this place with the deepest recesses of my soul. Ike and Huda (the owners) are THE most disrepectful people I have ever met. Business owerns should try be good neighbors, not the worst ones you've ever met. [And just to make it clean, we've lived here for 8 years, our neighbors 16 years, and our other neighbors for over 30 years. None of us have ever complained about any other business in this neighborhood.]This place is smelly, dirty, grimy, noisy and I would not trust the food for anything. Actually, I have eaten here 3 times...and each time afterwards my stomach hurt. Not in the "I ate too much hurt" but as in "what was in that sandwich because I feel BAD." I do not trust their ingredients. And for the record, the vegan sandwiches are "accidently vegan." Just because you found something as Costco that doesn't have dairy listed in the ingredients does not give you the right to advertise your shop as vegan. San Francisco prides itself on good practices and therefore I am astonished that no one has tried to shut this place down. How can so many people trust eating here? The floor is sticky, it's smelly, there's trash everywhere, pigeons flying around and I would not be surprised if roaches and mice were hanging around. (Edit: a little over a week ago I saw 3 mice scurrying around the boxes of bread)I realize there is a huge fan base, but people have got to start paying more attention. For your viewing pleasure I have posted pictures of there trash and their lovely storage. Did you know they store the food outside by the trash cans? Yum! (Correction: I did post picutures, but Ike complained and they were taken down. If they were good pictures, he wouldn't have complained.)
LOVE this place.I am a spoiled-rotten ex-nightlife industry employee, who has never had to wait in a line in her entire adult life... I waited in line for a sandwich from Ike's, and after my first bite, I wasn't even mad anymore. I had the most AMAZING turkey and avocado sandwich with pepper jack cheese ever. Ever! It was so incredibly delicious, that I wish Ike had a shop up in Marin, so I could go stand in line there, too.Plus, Ike is totally adorable and friendly... I was with three of my friends, and when he found out that two of them were splitting a sandwich, he came out and gave them an extra lollipop, because "You can't share these!" So cute!
HOLY MOTHER OF GOD!!!! I've seen the light and at the end of the tunnel was Ike's! Been dying to try Ike's finally drove by without seeing a huge line wrapping the block so I jumped out of the car and within 10 minutes got my hands around two ridiculously delicious sandwiches: the Barack and the pastrami. The BBQ sauce on the Barack was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!! In the infamous words of our govenator: "I'll be back..."
I like everyone else on Planet Earth first heard about this place by watching Man vs. Food. Whenever I see a place on the show and cross reference it with some Yelp Reviews, I usually find that the hype Adam gives it and the hype Yelpers give it often don't match. This is one of those rare exceptions. After a nice Saturday at the California Academy of Sciences, my friends and I decided to head over to the Castro and see what all the fuss was about. We had to drive around for about 15 minutes trying to find a parking spot, but that's a normal issue if you want to go anywhere in the area. It was about 3 in the afternoon and the line was looooonnnggggg. We ended up waiting for about an hour to get our sandwiches. When I first got there, I was kicking myself for not remembering to call in the order beforehand. But then I overheard a girl who had just got her sandwich telling her friend that she called in the order 3 hours ago!!! So I guess it didn't really matter.The menu is huge. There are 100+ sandwiches in the menu. It is a bit daunting but there is ample time for you to look through the menu while you are waiting in line. The service is great. In spite of the huge lines gracing this place everyday, the people working there genuinely seemed happy to be there. Since you aren't actually allowed into the shop, the owner Ike brings every order to each customer waiting on the street. He was incredibly nice, and took the extra steps to thank me for coming and shook my hand.There are no tables set up where you can eat, and there is a big sign in the window of the store respectfully asking that customers respect the neighbor's property by not eating on their stoops. So my friends and I had to find a spot to parking lot pimp it.As for the food, all I can say is "Wow!!" I had just eaten beforehand, so I know my review was not unfairly affected by my hunger. This is the best sandwich I have ever had! I got the SF Giants sandwich (Turkey, Bacon, Mushrooms, Avocado, and Swiss) on Dutch Crunch. Whatever you do, do not get anything but the Dutch Crunch. It is crispy, soft, and fresh at the same time. If I could, I would make pillows of it and sleep on them. That's not to denigrate the rest of the sandwich though. The vegetables and turkey were incredibly fresh and the bacon. OMG the bacon! Oh so crispy but not overdone. There was not one bad part about the sandwich. It was so good that I almost thought about waiting another hour for another sandwich.Cost: $32 for a Eli Manning, Tony Soprano, Barack, and 3 Pepsi's
Finally came here after hearing about all the rage on this place. My goodness! It's so easy to spot with the people waiting outside this place. Good thing i got there before it got too crowded. The customer service and environment was definitely an extra plus for me. They were super friendly and helpful. Watching them work while waiting for my food made it seem like it'd be really fun to work there. The workers all had plenty of smiles of their face - don't usually see that very often. When my friends and i finally got our sandwiches, my friends got super excited over the caramel apple lollipop that comes with the sandwiches along with the chips. Haha, it brought back memories of when we would eat though during our middle school days :) As i took my first bite, i was welcomed by a mesh of different tastes. I had ordered the SF Giants (gotta keep my SF pride!), which had turkey, bacon, mushrooms, avocados, and swiss cheese. Next time, i might forgo the bacon (a little too much for me 'specially since i'm not too big of a fan of bacon) but BOY was that sandwich filling. I was already beginning to get full after my first half of the sandwich. Despite being a just a tad bit pricier than usual sandwich places, it was definitely worth it. The cool and unique names for the sandwiches were definitely an eyecatcher :) Great place. Would definitely come back, but probably not that often -- haha gotta let my wallet breathe a little. Although you should definitely be prepared for the wait. despite having a good amount of workers, the amount of customers surely trumps that. Even though my friends and i got there at a fairly not too busy time, we still had to wait a good 20-25 mins for our sandwiches. note to self: order by phone next time to lessen the waiting time :)
Tom Brady. 'Nuff said.The deets: Best Vegetarian sandwiches I've ever had. They have over 40, of the 20 or so I've tried they all are far superior to any other veggie sandwich from any other place.
I like Ike's for the following reasons:1.) I don't like ordering your typical cold cut sandwiches. Bologna, turkey, ham = BORING. Ike's sandwiches have unique fillings and lots of them are hot (literally and figuratively)2.) Two words: dutch crunch. Although Ike's takes it one step further by basically putting deliciousness between two slices of dutch crunch garlic bread!3.) Old-fashioned sodas.4.) "Happy hour" = free old-fashioned soda. And kettle chips. 6-9pm only!5.) Did I mention dutch crunch?No wonder there's a huge line for lunch every day. The hype is real! I've never had such a delicious sandwich before!My order was an Eli Manning sandwich: Halal chicken, which was tasty and tender, avocado, garlic and herb mayo, mushrooms, lettuce and your other typical veggies, on toasted dutch crunch garlic bread, toasted until you can smell the goodness from a mile away! WOW!I went back the following week and got myself a Nacho Boy sandwich. Roast beef, mushrooms, avocado, swiss cheese. YUM!My only concern is that the sandwiches are not cheap. Mine was one of the more expensive sandwiches at about $11. The only thing that made it a slightly better value was the free soda and chips they threw in. Not a can of Coke and Lays, but your choice of an old-fashioned soda in a bottle and a bag of "dirty" kettle chips. However, you only get this during "Happy Hour", which was going on when I got there at 6:30 PM. Although, that's the best time to go anyway because there's less of a line. My recommendation: go here for dinner and call your order in ahead of time!I try to avoid driving around the Castro District as much as I can, but if there's a reason for me to venture around those streets risking spotting two men doing more than holding hands, that reason would be to stop at Ike's Place. Their sandwiches are LEGIT! I'd say these are sandwiches with attitude. Tasty, unique, and very much San Franciscan, they're definitely at the top of my list!
My cousin and i decided to come here to try the sandwiches because of all the reviews. We called in our order two hours ahead of time so we wouldnt have to wait in line.The sandwiches were honestly...only mediocre. In my opinion, little lucca's in Burlingame has way better sandwiches. The dutch crunch they used was good but the dirty sauce here wasn't really that special. The sandwich wasnt as big as people made it seem either. I guess i just had my hopes to high and was expecting something amazing. Not really worth waiting that long in line for unless you called ahead of time.
I'm a bit torn as I write this review..On one hand, my bf had the most delicious, amazing sandwich ever. He ordered the "Sexy Boy" which is steak, mozzarella sticks and Ike's dirty sauce. It tasted so goooooddd...On the other hand, I ordered the "Menage a Trois". I opened up my sandwich and it was dripping in dirty sauce, actually it was drenched in it. I tried my best to eat as quickly and cleanly as possible (since we were sitting on the corner of the street) but the dirty sauce won and I was covered in it. My bread was all soggy and I was a hot mess. I did however see a lot of potential and will definitely go back to try again, but this time ask them to go easy on the juice..
One word: BOMB! Get the Kryptonite. It has virtually every meat you can think of, along with mozzarella sticks, jalepeno poppers, and special sauce. Soooo good. One sandwich will fill you for lunch and dinner no problem. The damn thing weighs like 3 lbs. A word of advice, don't go here and get some weak sandwich like a ham and cheese or something. If you are going to go, go big. God I'm craving it just thinking about it.
As a result of all the hype, I was super excited to try these sandwiches. I went halves with my man and tried the Hot Momma Huda (Halal Chicken Breast, Franks Red Hot, Ranch, Provolone) and the Pride of Castro (Turkey, Ham, Brie). Everyone goes on about the sauces but what came on these were too weak in flavor to really make a statement. Pretty much you'll get these kinds of sandwiches anywhere that offers quality meats and decadent cheese.
Best menage a trois I've ever had. :0) I highly recommend that one. The bf got the napolean complex but it wasn't as succulent or as sweet and tangy as the menage (due to honey and bbq).Food is 5 stars but one less for the long wait and the fact that there is no dining tables anymore. I'm definitely going back as many times as possible to try all of the 50+ sandwiches they offer.
Kryptonite... Omg. When they handed me the bag I had to look in side. I was in awe. It's literally two sandwiches. Took it back to the office and put it on a postal scale. It was 3-1/3 pounds.Shared it. Loved it.
The sandwich here are about $10.00, so worth it because it is so yummy. Every thing is written on the board, so make sure to tell them to add whatever you want in it because they won't. The portion of the sandwich is split into two and come with a bag of chip. I got fulled by eating half a sandwich and there is a park near by to sit and eat, since they don't have much seating in there.
Great service, amazing food and totally worth it.
You know when you go somewhere knowing you'll have to wait at least 30 minutes in line and you choose to go there anyways, it's a good sign for business! Whenever I go to Ike's, I try to go during off peak hours... whatever that means. For Ike's, the only off peak hours they have is when they are closed! The interesting thing is that I don't mind at all waiting for the yummy goodness that I have awaiting to rest peacefully in my belly. It's almost the ritual of Ike's. You go and just chill in line. You read the menu of what seems like a million different sandwiches for the 100th time just in case you missed one possible selection the last time you read it for 20 minutes, and you kick back and wait your turn to submit the Ike's sandwich of your choosing. It's almost as if we wouldn't be doing the Ike's sandwich justice if we didn't put in that time of reservation before hand.
I am a fan for sure! The only thing I didn't like was the line and the complete lack of seating... but sometimes when something is good, you just have to put up with other annoyances. And... I am not so sure I would want to eat somewhere that didn't have a line of some sort. Lines typically indicate success!So, I thought I'd be brave and order the Kryptonite sandwich. It was $20, but... It is honestly like 4 sandwiches, so well worth the money. I think I will try and order the smaller version next time. I am still eating the leftovers the next day and even though it is soggy... it is still DELICIOUS!!The people working there were in a good mood and very nice to talk to, the smell coming from the place was amazing and the actual food is good... so, if you have time to stand in line, then this place is definitely worth the wait!
Ike's Place has a really good thing goin on.For one, they have a menu that's numbered up to 200. If you can't find one thing (or even 10 things) that don't sound good to you, you're either a very picky eater or you have to be crazy. Their menu ranges from the simple combos of classic sandwich ingredients to the more special items including fried mozzarella sticks, beer battered onion rings, and jalapeno poppers.Because there were too many good things to choose from, I closed my eyes and chose a random sandwich off of their menu. I got the "Not Tonight, I Have a Headache" which consisted of chicken breast, bbq sauce, gouda cheese, and bacon, with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and peppers. The bread was perfectly toasted and the sandwich was warm. Damn, it was pretty delicious. Know that the Ike's experience includes a long wait, but if you're as excited as my friends and I were, you won't mind. You can call in your order too, if you're not down for waiting for 10-15 minutes. Also, there are only two tables that fit 4 people each, so don't count on eating your sandwiches there. Lines are usually long and I guess we were just lucky to get a table. Finally, the servers are pretty friendly and greet everyone with a smile, which I thought was cool since they were taking orders outside in the cold all day.I would have to say that although this place is not the best of all sandwich places (That spot in my heart belongs to Little Lucca's in SSF) it is one of the best in the bay area. If I was in the area I would definitely come back. Who wants to meet me up and split the Kryptonite with me!??? (Go look it up, it was on the travel channel show Man Vs. Food) I'm serious. Let's go.
Woohoo! As good as it gets! Ike's Place LOVES their customers! They are super helpful and never give off a vibe of trying to rush you. A few tips:If you want do the wait, head over and wait in line, it'll be up to an hour before you order and another 10 mins or so before you get your bite of heaven.If you're in line, grab a menu, browse it and then call them for your order, while you're in line!If you know what you want and you're in a rush, call ahead of time.a MILK Menage-A-Trois?! I'm in! Grab a bag of Funky Fusion.
Dear Yelp,When I came to San Francisco I was just an impressionable young lad with my mom's bratwurst on a spotlighted pedestal. Now that I'm grown I realize the world doesn't revolve around my mom's bratwurst. It revolves around Ike's. I give it a fantastic 5 out of 5 stars.Love,Zachariah
So this goes back to when Ike's was just Ike's at their own spot.There's been a lot of reviews already but re-emphasis on dutch-crunch bread and any of the sandwiches are amazing.pros: everything!cons: long lines (skip the long lines and call in advance to pick your order!) this may be the best advice I can give to anyoneenjoy
Great Coffee, excellent service! such a creative menu
Best sandwiches in SF hands down.My favorites:Menage a Trois (Halal Chicken Breast, Real Honey, Honey Mustard, BBQ, PepperJack, Swiss, Smoked Gouda)King Koopa (All Beaf Meatballs, Mozzarella Sticks, Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers, Marinara)
Still 5 stars. I've tried several sandwiches here since my first time, including the veg version of the Menage Trois (the Love Triangle). It wasn't as good as I would've been led to believe; however, I think I have to return back to the Captain Corey (the veg version of We're Just Friends) where it all began for me. One thing I've always been impressed with, despite how trendy this place has gotten, is Ike's presence. It's wonderful to see the owner of an establishment (with more than one location) there more often than not there. For example, today, in the crappy SF rain, my boyfriend and I were cheerfully handed our hot, fresh, sandwiches by the man himself. The Lime location is getting a bit tired, especially on their club thumping weekend afternoons. I can't wait for Ike to open the new location!
Amazing. My family here in Los Angeles drool when I mention your name.
I have wavered for months about writing this review. Ike's has a large fan base and some die-hard sandwich lovers ready to defend this business at any cost. I'm bracing for whatever backlash I encounter as a result of this unfavorable review. Ultimately, I decided to write it because people need to know the truth about these sandwiches. They're just okay and occasionally, they're bad. Here's why: The idea of fried mozzarella sticks on a sandwich is really appealing to me too, but they totally weren't worth the wait I spent, compounded by the fact that the sticks were placed on an otherwise bland sandwich. Let me explain... I had heard about Ike's through the grapevine. A friend posted on Fbook about the "Fat Bastard" and how amazing it was. I was intrigued by the fried cheese aspect. Cheese + sandwich = good. Cheese + fried + sandwich (should) = amazing. I went to the website where I found promises of fresh baked bread: Fresh baked to order to be exact. I had to have one! So, I decided to head down to Ike's one Sunday for what I was hoping would be a life changing sandwich experience. I knew there would be a wait, so I took my friend's advice and called ahead. This was around noon. I was quoted a 2 hour wait for 2 sandwiches. Uh buh?! WTF for? I get that it's busy around lunch, but fresh baked to order bread or not, 2 hours is unacceptable for lunch. Strike 1! I made my way down 2 hours later and still had to wait in line for 30 minutes or so in order to pay. Strike 2! Got the sandwiches and headed to Dolores Park, cause guess what, there's nowhere to sit. Fine, however, the sandwiches were ice cold by the time we got to the park, which has me thinking that they had been sitting for awhile. Here's where it gets bad... I ordered the "Damn Straight" because of the fried cheese and my husband ordered a "Mission P.Z. Burger". Neither sandwich was very good. The chicken was dry and bland in my "Damn Straight" and the fried cheese had long congealed by the time I ate it. My husband's burger was also bland. I kept hearing about this amazing Dirty Sauce, but I didn't taste it in my sandwich. Strike 3: Out! I will probably never go back to Ike's. I did give two stars for a reason though. It was nice to see the owner actively involved in his business whether I support that business or not; therefore, I did not withhold all 5 stars. The food was edible and I'm sure that if it hadn't been so cold by the time I got it, it would have been palatable, so 2 stars only. So there you have it, a bad Ike's review to balance out all the raves. If you feel this way too, you're not alone; however, you will never convince the hardcore Ike's disciples otherwise. I learned an important lesson that day: If the restaurant has been featured on "Man vs. Food", buyer beware! If that fatter-by-the-minute Adam Richman endorses it, it's probably more about quantity than quality.
A couple friends and I were down there a few days ago, and we were adamant about trying all the best places san fran has to offer, and Ike's was one of those places. I personally had never heard of this place, but my friends swore it would be amazing. We got there and it's a little hole in a wall place. There was a HUGE line around the corner, I was a little peeved because it was our last day in san fran and I wanted to make the most of it rather then wait in line for a sandwich, well let me tell you this the hour and a half wait was well worth it. I got an "ex boyfriend" and my friend got the "tony soprano" and we shared, it was orgasmic! Best sandwich I have ever had in my life, and let me tell you I have tried a lot of sandwiches. I kid you not the long wait is worth it!PS Ike himself brings the sandwich to the customer and it's something very simple, but it shows that he respects/appreciates his customers.
+ The meatball sub - awesome indeed + Sliced mozzeralla sticks for the cheese - innovative+ Marinara tangy but not too much - really tasty + Dutch crunch bread with burnt offerings on the edges and top - fantasticI'm going to study the menu online before I visit again. The sandwich was huge. No doubt a profound and life altering experience if encountered with a serious case of the munchies.The best part was waiting for product. The line was very short. It took 15 minutes after I ordered. Happy people waiting for sandwich goodness. The sun came out.
What else can I say that hasn't been said before? One of the best sandwiches, if not THE BEST, I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. This place has nearly 2000 reviews for a reason. I don't know why I waited this long to try this place out but I will gladly make up for the lost time I have not been eating their sandwiches.I came here with my friends after exploring the neighborhood. It was a cold afternoon and not a lot of people were there. So we had some time just to stand there and look at the crazy huge menu of sandwiches. I finally decided on The Backstabber. We actually got lucky because it was their happy hour and we got a free drink and chips along with our sandwich. AWESOME. So while we were waiting, we were entertained by their staff of sandwich makers goofing around and looking like they genuinely enjoy their job. Always a plus. Then I got my sandwich, sat down outside the place and devoured that son of a bitch. The dirty sauce definitely made it a million times better and definitely worth the money I shelled out.If you like sandwiches, things that are crazy delicious, and a combination of both, then you should make a stop at Ike's Place or else you haven't been to San Francisco.
Call in to order in advance.Sandwiches are DELICIOUS.
GOTTA love this place. Came here on a friend's recommendation when i visited SF this past weekend. I'm vegan so i ordered the vegan meatball which tasted just like a real meatball sandwich. It is in the middle of castro district, cute little place, waited about 20 min for the food but was well worth it. I have friends that come here everyday and love the "dirty sauce". Very friendly employees and very clean. My meatball sandwich had lettuce, tomatoes, jalapenos. Every bite was savory
***Valentine's Day Update***So, yes. i took my valentine's date here because the sandwiches are just THAT GOOD! i didn't know they changed their hours and are forced to close at 7pm because neighbors complained about the sandwich-loving crowd growing out of control. So we showed up to order at 7:20pm and there was plenty of people still outside waiting for their order. We asked a polite short man if it was too late to order and he said unfortunately it was but there was an order someone didn't pick up and if we like, we can have those sandwiches for free! i was super excited to try something new but concerned because my girlfriend is vegetarian. turns out the two sandwiches he gave us was exactly what we were going to order, including her veggie friendly sandwich. :-) that just set the mood for the rest of our perfect V-day.....oh, and the guy that gave us the sandwiches... Ike himself!
I haven't posted in sooo long. But how could I not after trying Ikes??! I didn't have much expectations but have heard good stuff about this place. I went with a few other friends so it didn't seem like the wait was long. We just chatted away and before you know it, it was our turn. The girl who took our order was very friendly and had a great sense of humor, which would totally ease the frustration and tension for those who have to wait long. There were 3 of us and we told her we were going to share the sandwiches. She offered to have each sandwich split into 3s! That was very nice of her 'cause c'mon, she really didn't have to go through the extra step.NAME OF GIRL I'M DATINGIt was good. Don't know why so many people recommended it though. The others were so much better! This one had halal chicken breast, honey mustard, avocado, and pepper jack. The chicken was plump and juicy. I don't like mustard and I was barely able to taste it.THE PIZZLEThis was my favorite of all three. This one had halal chicken breast, bacon, ranch, and cheddar. How can anything go wrong with bacon or ranch? Well, this sandwich had both and the combo along with the chicken and cheddar cheese was amazing! Definitely a must try. I choose this over the Hella Fat Bastard 'cause it wasn't as heavy and filling."HELLA" FAT BASTARDDon't get this one mixed up with the Fat Bastard. I felt so bad ordering this one. I had to lower my voice. This fatty had ham, mozzarella sticks, bacon, and their famous dirty sauce. I still don't know what the dirty sauce is. I don't remember tasting any sauce since I was focused on savoring the mozzarella, haha. If you're craving for something very savory and rich, this is it!There we go. Ah. I feel so much better after sharing about my good eats. I should stop being lazy and post more!By the way, there's nowhere to sit or put your sandwiches down so that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. The food itself is definitely 5 stars ;). It would be nice if they had a few tall tables outside with no chairs. I would recommend eating it right then and there when it's fresh out of the oven. Bring some wet naps along.
2 hour to go wait. No parking. Buy one get one free coupon. I'd really rather the price of the sandwiches to be cheaper than to have a bag of chips. I had Mac Cain i think... the one with red pesto. My sandwich was kind of cold, so I felt like it wasn't freshly made even though it was. Eh... overrated. It's just another sandwich to me. I'm not sure if I even tasted the dirty sauce... Basically, if my friend was to go to Ikes to get sandwiches then I wouldn't mind ordering one. Prob won't go back.The cashier was super nice even though it was so busy, so that was good.
I've only been to San Francisco once, but Ike's Place is all I can think of when I want a good sandwich. The wait wasn't too long, and you have time to mull over what you want while the line moves forward. Granted, there isn't anywhere to sit, but when you're on the move, why sit when you can admire what's around you?The sandwiches are sooooo good. Fresh, crammed with everything you ask for, but all in a size you can handle. I finished both halves of my sandwich in one sitting and was contemplating getting one for the road. If I could go back to San Francisco for any reason, it'd be for Ike's.
Never been to a sandwich place like this.Best Sandwich The MILF or Jessica Rabbit. (same stuff ones just vegetarian)Breaded chicken, wing sauce, ranch.yummmmThreesome is another great sandwich and honestly would have never ate it but my friend Angela a hottie who works there suggested it. BBQ Sauce, Chicken and Honey ooooh la laThey have all kinds of craziness like onion rings and mega sandwiches with triple meat and like 20 toppings.Just try it. if you dont like it you must not like to eat or something.
So I'm not sure why I was initially so hesitant about going to Ike's. I guess I've become pretty cynical in regards to "vegan sandwiches" and whatnot, as it's usually salad stuffs chucked in bread (and I don't like salad). But as Ike's is right around the corner from my friend's place, we decided to drop in and check it out as the latest in our sampling of all the vegan-friendly restaurants in town.We couldn't find it at first, as it was nighttime and Ike's is tucked away on a residential little strip, but we finally saw the blue storefront and went in. It's a small, cozy little joint that more than makes up for the lack of huge seating area by a huge vegan menu. I am not used to having so much selection when it comes to sandwiches! It's usually either "roasted red pepper, no cheese" or "garden burger" and I am terribly tired of both. So imagine my excitement when I saw options like Vegan Turkey & Cranberry and a Meatless Meatball Sub! I was biting my lip a little, trying to choose between the two, but as per Ike's recommendation I went with the Sub and it did not disappoint. It was delicious! Just the perfect combination of ingredients. The patty-esque meatballs with the vegan cheese (more than one kind if I am correct), marinara and much-hyped "dirty sauce" between hot bread was so drippy good that I wanted to snarf down the entire thing in a most unladylike fashion. My friend loves his real meat meatball subs but had nothing but high praise for it as well. It honestly deserves it.Ike was super helpful and rad, definitely the friendliest person to make me a sandwich in a long time. I can't wait to try some of the other ones. I am not much of a reviewer but Ike's was great enough that I am dragging myself out of Yelp obscurity to give 5 stars and tell everyone to go try the Meatless Sub. Ask for extra "dirty sauce." :)
What's to be said about Ike's that hasn't been said. It's delicious and the staff is friendly. I went with three friends and everyone sandwiches was pretty delicious. Call ahead and place your order. They are patient on the phone with newbies. I came an hour later and the sandwich was ready to go. Also, the chips they have go perfectly with their sandwiches. I didn't even know they were included in the price. If you enjoy warm fresh sandwiches, go here.
It's really sad that this place is really gonna close down for real now. I've came here about 4 times since August and Ike's has never let me down with their tasty sandwiches.I always did phone orders because I never wanted to wait in line for it. I usually call during their happy hour time so I can get a free drink as well :) Anyways, I've tried the menage a trois, Jerie's big meat sandwich, the change, and Matt Cain. All of them were SUPER good. I think the best one would have to be the menage a trois. Just something about that sandwich was amazingly good... And I also love how they gave out caramel apple lollipops in the bag. They're so AWESOME!!!Goodbye Ike's Place in SF. You have treated me well. Since I live in San Jose for school, I guess I have to visit Stanford to eat your delicious sandwiches. We will meet again.
I previously gave Ike's 5 stars. I have a picture of me and Ike in the Redwood city lobby together. I used to love this place and told everyone in my family, and all my friends about it. But now, I will never go to Ike's again. Ever.The wait times are simply horrendous, and the quality control is even worse. Two times in a row now they have botched numerous sandwiches, even when they were trying to fix the previous botch. Today we ordered five menage a trois AS IS. We got two as is, and two with veggies. So one person got no sandwich, and the other two didn't eat theirs. This is on top of getting sandwiches we didn't even order previously (ordered turkey and bacon, got a Flipper). This is on top of having to wait 30 minutes longer than what we were told on the phone for a pickup time. Times used to be exact, but no more apparently. Sorry Ike's -- love the menage a trois but the waits are too long and the accuracy is too low to try this again.Plus raising the prices by $2 in SF and throwing in chips is ridiculous.
So I was visiting a friend near SF and I asked him what was a "must have" and with out any hesitation he takes me to Ike's. The sandwich shop from outside looked very plain but I was definitely in for a surprise. As soon as I took my first bite, my taste buds started to dance. Even to the last bite I was tearing up from the overwhelming flavor the sandwich had to offer. If you haven't had Ike's then you haven't had a REAL sandwich. My goal is to try all the different sandwiches and when i do, I can die happy =)
Ike's Place is definitely my go-to place to eat whenever I'm back in the city. It's the first thing I think of for good eats in San Francisco, and also the first thing I crave when I'm back in it.I've been on the search for another sandwich that is just as good, if not better, than the Matt Cain I had my first time here. I've had the Spiffy Tiffy, Lincecum, Damon Bruce, Menage Trois. While all of these sandwiches are good in their own right, according to my taste buds, they aren't on par with The Matt Cain. I've recently come here with a renewed vigor and an obsession with avocado, so I decided avocado was the way to go for any good sandwich. My [hungry] gut instinct turned out to be right. I ordered the Tom Brady, a vegan sandwich that DOESN'T TASTE VEGAN AT ALL. Tom Brady is made up of Vegan Breaded Chicken, Garlic & Herb Sauce, Mushrooms, Avocado, and Soy Cheese. The Vegan Chicken tasted like real chicken, and with dirty sauce - amazing. Since I added the beer-battered onion rings to the Matt Cain the first time I had it, I decided to add them to the Tom Brady, too. DELICIOUS. Avocado + onion rings = ALWAYS A GOOD CHOICEI've decided that I have to have this combination in any sandwich I get from Ike's.
THE PLACE WITH THE BEST SANDWICHES! We've heard about it from friends and even seen it on T.V. and was wondering what the hype was all about! Decided to try it one day and yes, the line is long but worth the wait! We've tried the menage a trois which was great; the super mario was packed with meatballs and mozzarella bread sticks and my 8 yr old LOVED it and didn't even want to share!; the spiffy tiffy was DELICIOUS! The dirty sauce is worth having on your sandwiches as well!I think the best time to go there is early during a weekday. Weekends come packed since Club Lime is going during the AFTERNOON. Yes, the afternoon! If that's the case, call your order in. Sandwiches range from $8.98 and up. Totally worth the price! But, IT IS NOT GOOD FOR KIDS! Why? Since it is a club and this place is usually packed due to it's business, it gets a bit crammed.
Absolutely worth the wait and the cost. The hype is true. Especially if you're a vegan or vegetarian, this is the go-to destination for the best damn sandwiches in the entire San Francisco Bay Area. (My current favorite is the vegan Bud Bundy: vegan turkey, soy cheese, avocado, and sesame sauce. OMG yum.) May this city treasure stay around for a long, long time.
Okokok so after trying the Joker (meatballs, red pesto, fried zucchini, ranch)... I can understand how it's worth the $10 and 45 min wait. I would recommend calling ahead and just waiting in the comforts of your home because it'll take just as long standing in line to order and then actually getting the sandwich. On weekdays during lunch they don't seem to have the tables set up for you to sit on.
Does Ike's need another glowing 5 star review? No, not really. I've eaten here multiple times but always figured eh, why bother. Yes, I love the sandwiches. Yes, I travel all the way across town and wait in line for them. Yes, sometimes my entire day revolves around going to Ike's. I've probably spent over an hour studying the entire menu and highlighting all of the sandwiches I want to try. What is it that makes Ike's so great? Sure, they have more veggie options than most vegetarian restaurants have, many of those being vegan. And sure, the ingredients are always fresh and the combinations literally endless. The warm Dutch Crunch really is worth writing home about (as proven by my emails to my hometown friends re: sandwich you must try when visiting SF). And let's not forget about that Dirty Sauce....that disgustingly amazing Dirty Sauce.But even after all of that, I really didn't think I had anything to say that hadn't already been said.And then I met Ike at the Yelp Unwrapped Holiday Party, and he made an even bigger impression than his sandwiches had (well, almost, I really love the Dirty-CA Roll). I'd seen him multiple times before when ordering and eating sandwiches, but he was always busy at work. When I saw him at the party, I got all nervous but then worked up the (liquid) courage to ask for a photo. I expected him to quickly pose and smile, and then go on his merry sandwich-master way. But instead he took the photo, then asked our names and starting chatting with us. We told him we loved Ike's and he thanked us multiple times for the support. At the end of it all, he thanked us again (by name, which he remembered), and said goodbye. What I gathered from our conversation was that Ike is passionate about sandwiches, he loves San Francisco, and he is truly appreciative of all his loyal sandwich-eating supporters.Over one week later, and I'm still not over Ike...he just may be the nicest person I've ever met. And there is definitely something to be said for a guy who works the cash register and serves food alongside the staff at his own uber-successful and busy restaurant. And there's something more to be said for a guy whose staff is always friendly and pleasant, no matter how hectic the line out the door.So no, Ike does not need one more 5 star glowing review, but he certainly deserves one.
Ike's does not need another glorifying 5 star review, but here it is...AMAZING! The BEST sandwich I have EVER had. I've had the:MILF Mill's Viking + mozzarella sticksThe MILF was so good that a few days later I actually took the BART from Berkeley to 16th St Mission just to get another sandwich.I recommend ordering over the phone to avoid the long lines. If you are going to stand in line, the wait isn't too bad in the evenings. I went at around 4PM on a Tuesday and it only took 30 mins to get my food.The dirty sauce is memorable. I highly recommend 'feeling extra dirty' and adding mozzarella sticks or jalapeo poppers to your sandwich, if the sandwich doesn't already come with it.Also - the dutch crunch is realllllly good.

It is a travesty of blockbuster summer movie proportions that Ike's Place is closing tomorrow. Que the disaster effects and the masses of people screaming in the streets. At least today, I get one last dance with the Hot Momma Houda. This review is rated R for excessive deliciousness.
Very good sandwiches. I enjoyed my Paul Ruebens. -1 star because they don't make real subs and their menu is just too complicated. This place is also crazy popular, there is just about always a line.Pro tip - you can call in your order to pick it up to skirt the line.
Delicious sandwiches.Not worth the wait, though. Because the wait is usually, like, 50 people long.In the past I'd avoided this place like the plague because of the seemingly endless queue of assholes standing outside...until Thanksgiving.I guess all the bath-phobic scenesters were too busy ironically eating their tofu turkey logs to bother on this all-American of holidays.Had the BBQ Chicken. Scrumptious. Great service. Lovely and personable folks. But seriously, who lines up this long for a sandwich? Make it the fuck at home.
I've been hearing about this place for a while and have been dying to check it out. and ill be the one millionth person to say that it is worth ALL of the hype.best to come on a sunny day since youll be standing outside waiting for your order. i had a really tough time choosing a sandwich with their impressively large array of sandwiches for every palette but the staff at Ike's is surprisingly friendly, casual and eagar to help you narrow your choice with insider recommendations and opinions...i ended up getting the "Super Mario" (per recommendation) which was a meatball sub with mozzarella sticks and all the topping. AAAAAmazing. i think besides the stellar food, the friendly staff is what impressed me the most. i will be visiting this local gem in the VERY near future!and yes, the dirty sauce is redonkulous. a MUST have.
Let me start of by saying that the reason that this does not have 5 stars is ONLY because there are no tables to eat at its location.  Ok, so for my first time i wanted to try the Jim Rome having heard from my friend that it is amazing. The cashier recommended that i add bacon to it and that itself has another name that I forgot...anyways, the sandwich was amazing, end of story. I'm glad i got the bacon added on. Best sub sandwich i have ever had. A must try if you are in SF looking for lunch.
Awesome sandwiches!! Be prepared for 40 min/1 hour wait but i can tell you its definitely worth the wait.
Great food, good prices, fast service unless the line is long but worth the wait.
I want to rub dirty sauce all over my naked body. It is so delcious. The sandwiches are so good!! I had one with sweet orange sauce and one bbq sauce. Seriously the sandwiiches are one of a kind. I have never had anything so good between bread. The wait is painfully long. I mean like an hour in line. If it wasnt for the wait I would eat there everyday and weigh 500000 pounds. So I am thankful for the wait. I bring friends and family here just because I feel like its a part of sf history now.
Hands down the best sandwich shop EVER. Seriously, I've had some damn good sandwiches in my day. Ike is often there himself and the rest of the staff is always friendly regardless of the constant line leading down the block. Well done on the new location/space. Menage a trois and Eli Manning are two CLASSIC FAVES.Well done Ike. Keep on bringin it.
Whats up with the "@limes?" Did they buy the place? Or are they just using it for awhile? Because as of right now Ikes is looking real hurt. When you order and sit in to eat you sit on this cushioned club seats and the place just looks disorganized. Theres the random bar that no one sits at because well, Ikes isnt a bar. And you order at the door which is super awkward because people are coming in and out and it gets crowded. However none of this takes away from the food. The sandwiches are amazing! I ordered #8 which was a BBQ one so I couldn't really tell how the dirty sauce tastes like. Doesn't matter because the sandwiches were amazing and lived up to expectations. The meal comes with a caramel pop and a bag of dirty chips which complements the sandwich as usual. Other than the place, which prevented me from giving this place 5 stars, Ikes is the place to eat!
You saw this place on the Travel Channel? So did I!Man, long lines all day everyday.But their nice enough to pass the menu down the line so you know what you want when you get up there.Another one of those places that if I lived there it would be on the regular rotation.
The website's domain should be iloveikesplace.com. Because I love Ike's Place.Got Doomsday on Dutch Crunch. Got the bag. Was like damn, is this really one sandwich? It was like a baby in there. A magical tasting baby.When I took out the first half of the sandwich, it said Dooms. For some reason, the idea that they would write Day on the other half amused me, and I hoped so very hard for it to be so.And it was.Ike's Place, I love you.
I think that we all get it, this place is awesome and they have the best sandwiches around. I ordered some grub for me and my Beau before we went to the Giant's game a couple of weeks ago and Ike's didn't disappoint. I ordered The pizzle and menage a tois. And both were toasted on dutch crunch, nice and dirty, dripping down the arms delicious! Love the whole order over the phone 30 minutes before you need them deal. I can't wait to go back again, it already feels like forever.
This is hands down the best sandwich joint in the bay area. My friend called in before hand around 11am. Guess what time we had to pick up our sandwiches?3pm.Unbelievable. When we arrived, there was a line that looked an admission to a club. I would highly advise calling before hand.I had the Tony Soprano and it was delicious. Turkey, ham, and salami were in the sandwich. Even though the sandwich was pretty basic, it was an amazing sandwich. The dirty sauce is what makes the sandwich so unique. I swear I could apply this sauce to anything edible and it would make my life much happier.Aside from the long lines, the only other critique I have for this place is the parking. Castro is such a busy area in SF that it's quite difficult to find parking around Ike's. My main suggestion is going up the hills to find parking and walk a few blocks down to Ike's.If you're in San Francisco, I would highly recommend this place. It's out of the way from Downtown SF, but it's worth the trip to be honest with you. Lunch isn't the same in SF without Ike's.
I waited 2 hours for my sandwich and it was sooo worth it. We were waiting in line, which seemed like it would never budge. So we decided to order through the phone and pick it up at a later time. They said to come back almost 2 hours later, so we decided to stop by at the library located across the street. When it was time to wait outside to pick them up, we had to be mindful to no block the street and the doorways to the apartments since there have been complaints towards the customers by the locals that live there. Which is why they are forced to shut down soon and have to try to move somewhere else. It's pretty sad and frustrating but sort of understandable. I would get mad too if loud people were outside house all day long and making a mess.Anyways, my girlfriend got the Mills Viking, and my friend had the Nacho Boy. Both who say they are really good sandwiches. As for me, I just had a plain pastrami sandwich with everything on it. Pretty boring I know, but it was still one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. They have quality ingredients and quality meats.I would definitely recommend ordering a extra side of dirty sauce so that you dip or spread it on to your sandwich. It really enhances the sandwich. Please support this place and give it a try. Call ahead to avoid long lines, and I hope this place can stay a little bit longer.
IKE, i LIKELiterally arrived there in the afternoon and received my sandwich at sunset. Semi worth it though? Played the celebrity name game for an hour or two until we reached the front. I will definitely phone in and order my sandwich instead of waiting in line next time.I ordered the Sexy Boy, which was thinly sliced roast beef with mozzarella sticks. Yummm. The reason I took off a star was because it seemed like I didn't get any dirty sauce in my Sexy Boy :[ it made the sandwich very dry but still good. I tried a friends sandwich with dirty sauce. ugh dirty sauce made me feel dirty.. in a good way.
OMG! Don't come to this place hungry because you'll have to wait about 45 mins to an hour to eat. The smell of other people's sandwiches would just be torture. Trust me, it's worth the wait.I had the Manage-a-Trois (Halal Chicken Breast, Real Honey, Honey Mustard, BBQ, Pepper Jack, Swiss, Smoked Gouda). If you like sweet sandwiches, which I do, then you would love the manage-a-trois. I also added jalapeos to my sandwich for a little kick, no additional charge. I'm a small girl so I could only finish half a sandwich and I was full. I'm not sure if you can request for sauce on the side, but I think it would be a good idea because if you save it for later the bread would be soggy and you'll have to eat it with a fork and knife. That's how i ended up eating my second half for dinner.My hungry boyfriend ordered the Lex Luthor ( Pound Niman Ranch Beef Burger, Chicken Fried Steak, Rib Eye Steak, Mozzarella Sticks, American) and he was satisfied. If we knew, we could of just ordered the Lex Luthor and call it a day. The Lex Luthor comes in two separate sandwiches both with the same goodness. Even thought he was starving he couldn't finish them. He just saved it for a late afternoon snack and it wasn't soggy because I think the sauce got absorb by the fried steak or mozzarella stick. I had a bite and it was DELICIOUS.
My wife and I went here on a sunny day, and like thousands of others, we love Ike's Place. I never thought I would say this about a sandwich, especially given my extremely high expectations, but Ike's makes a fantastic sandwich. My wife and I had Name of Girl I'm Dating and Ex-Boyfriend, both were delicious.Where to start with all this delicious goodness? The fresh baked bread is awesome. Nice and crunchy on the outside (but not so crunchy it makes your mouth hurt), and soft and chewy on the inside. The ingredients all tasted really fresh, and they are proportioned perfectly. Each bite is an explosive culinary delight in your mouth. The chicken was cooked to perfection - it was not overdone or dry at all. Finally, the secret dirty sauce is a must. I'm not sure what they put in that, but it makes the sandwich fantastic!We are definitely going back for more. If you want to eat at Ike's I highly recommend calling ahead and ordering first. You can walk right up, pick up your sandwich, and avoid the insane line outside.
This was my Facebook status on Friday: "dear friday's blue shirted sandwich maker from ike's place, i just want you to know that you are my future husband. not only did your cute self scour the store in earnest to find my sized shirt, ike's also makes the best sandwiches on earth. so it's a done deal - you'll make me sandwiches and we can make babies."Truth. So completely worth an hour's wait. I had been building up Ike's for my Boston friend for about three months, and after the first bite she was in love and wants to move to SF. Win. The Manage-a-Trois sandwich is a foodgasm. I can't even...honeyed chicken, crisply chopped lettuce, fresh Dutch Crunch bread, DIRTY SAUCE. The world's problems could probably be solved by the mystical powers of Ike's. Beyond that, the Ike's staff are probably the nicest employees I have ever encountered. Case in point: Friday's visit that caused such a public display of adoration. I was interested in buying an Ike's shirt from Mr. Blue Shirt who took our order, but they were all out of my size. The only size remotely close to mine, was a sandwich splattered shirt hanging in the window. After reaching in to grab it from over the hot stove he sold it to me for half price. Okayyy, mission accomplished. A shirt a bit too large, and splattered in sandwich, but no worries...we headed out to wait for our sandwich. After about ten minutes, Mr. Blue Shirt comes back out to the street clutching a sized small shirt in his hand and offers to exchange it at the same price. I think my friend and I were so shocked at the niceness we wound up just spazzing and spluttering words of gratitude. But know you have won our collective lifelong adoration. And inspired an hour long brainstorm on the best Ike's themed pickup lines/dirty jokes we could possibly think of. We thank you dearly.
The smart thing to do is to call in 30 minutes ahead of time and place your order so you don't have to wait in line for hours! Their dutch crunch bread is amazing! I'm not exactly sure how their dirty sauce tastes like but it definitely makes the sandwich really good if you get extra dirty sauce. The chicken is really soft... kind of like tuna... so if you hate tuna, don't get the chicken! so far I had the Fat Bastard, Ex-boyfriend, and [Name of Girl I'm Dating] and they were all really good! Happy Hour starts at 6, free chips and soda! They are getting evicted soon so please support them and buy their SF Giants t-shirts! sfgate.com/cgi-bin/artic
Best sandwich shop in SF. Hands down.
Great host. catered for 35 on a Sunday without any prearrangement. Danny is very helpful, and pleasant to work with.
i dont believe i am capable of accurately defining my experience at Ike's. if i could express my feelings for Ike's i would have to be some sort of higher being, if i could say how amazing this sandwich was, i would be endowed with the knowledge of all things. however i am happy to be but a simple human so that i may know that which is greater than me, and that greatness has a name and it is Ike's. The first bite of my Ike's sandwich was like be reborn, like looking into the face of god and seeing him smile back at me. In that moment i felt pure, i felt whole. I wept tears of joy that night, slept the best nights sleep i have ever had, and woke the next morning a new man.I once was lost, but now am found. I once was blind, but now i see.
We were in SF for the Thanksgiving holidays and after searching Yelp for all the best food joints we attempted to squeeze them all in. We ended up grabbing Ike's sandwiches to go in route to the airport. Parking wasn't so easy but the triple block was worth it. Those sandwiches must have magic or secret sauce. Eric got the Paul Reubens, and I got the Just Friends-the Reuben was much more flavorful. We both got the Dutch Crunch bread (recommend!). Will def get on next return. Note, eat asap so the sauce doesn't soften the bread, although it won't matter on flavors. Oh, and be hungry-they are generously sized.
The line can be really, really long but the sandwiches are great. Some of the best in SF!
Ike's lives up to the hype. Yes, the line can be long but the sandwiches are good.So far I've tried the "Say Hey" (Hot Pastrami, Bacon, Swiss) and the Change (Thinly Sliced RibEye Steak, Beer Battered Onion Rings, BBQ, Smoked Gouda). They were both tasty.They have so many different sandwiches to chose from that it's going to take me a while to try them all. I'm not saying that's a bad thing.
Ikes place? More like DYKES place! One word.....Lesbians. ;)
I have to admit I had my doubts about this place.. I thought my sandwich-eating mind had already been blown after I tried Little Lucca's for the first time. BUT from all the reviews and the perpetual line outside the door, I decided to try Ike's. Their menu is like a cheesecake factory menu, but without the ads. There are like 20 pages of sandwiches (i'm probably exaggerating, but it was a lot). I always like to go through the entire menu the first time I try a place, but it was cold outside and they were closing in 20 minutes so I just asked the hipster looking girl at the cash register what she recommended, and sure enough it was the menage a trois. Three kinds of cheese on this shredded bbq chicken sandwich, honey mustard, real honey, all the fixins and of course the famous dirrrty sauce. Mind blown again. Just an incredible explosion of flavor with each bite of this bad boy, with toasted bread warm and crisp to perfection. The dirrty sauce was baked INTO the bread and it made the bread almost the star of the show. It was just a perfect sandwich. And now I am torn. Which is my favorite bay area sandwich shop? Ike's Place or Little Lucca's? Great taste or Less filling? I CAN'T DECIDE! For now I just have to say I like them equally. You can't beat the price and size of a Little Lucca's sandwich, but Ike's Place you certainly have the sandwich-making trade down to an art.
Like most, HAD to try before it "closes." However, word in the place is that they will "serve sandwiches until they get cuffed" or even "serve on the streets!" Now THAT is dedication to the wich community. I loved the management there; a great sales rep for Ike's. He was friendly, engaging, reassured you, and made you feel like an Ike. It is funny that the sign says don't stand on the sidewalk to block the way, but there IS no where else to stand! I went a little before lunch time so the wait was about 30-45 minutes. Not too shabby. It was a little sad, but there was no where to go to eat on a cold SF day so had to eat in the car.After doing some research, the word on the cyberspace was to try the Menage a Trois and the Eli Manning. All the other options were fun to read as well and I'm sure they were as delicious. By golly, I also had to have an extra serving of the good ol' famous dirtE saucE!Anyway, the MENAGE A TROIS WAS SO DELICIOUS. It's something to definitely try because it's a type of wich you won't find anywhere else. The sweet sauce of honey BBQ with a little spicy kick left your buds wanting more. The dirty sauce was in great company as well, along with the dutch crunch. It is pricey, but it's something you won't try elsewhere. Why is it called a Menage a Trois?!? You pour honey on the 3 people? HAHA.Eli Manning. I'm surprised most people favor this one. It was GOOD of course, but it didn't leave me with a BANG. The taste left me feeling like I sort of ate a regular deli sandwich (Ike's had better quality I am sure) and nothing truly stood out for me. Maybe the way they made it that day wasn't as poppin'!?!?!? Therefore, one less star.The DIRTY chips were a delicious side as well. BBQ, vinegar and sea salt...yummy combo. Dessert was the nostalgic caramel apple pop. One thing I would have wished was that my cheese was more hot and gooey...but I love the fact that they make their wiches HOTTT.Live on, Ike's! LIVE LONG AND BE DIRTY!
Called in my order before a baseball game. Ordered Nacho Girl (salmon, mushrooms and Havarti. My other friends ordered Barry Zito. One liked it the other didn't. They didn't get the secret sauce which makes these sandwiches yummy!I liked my sandwich. Salmon was not overdone but perfect. I saved the other half for lunch the next day... MmMm Don't forget to get your bag of chips as well. It comes with the sandwich!Before I give it 4 stars, I need to try the other meats and veggies....
Heard about this place from friends and Man vs. Food and finally decided to give it a try when a friend came into town and wanted to try it out. Waiting in line reminded me of Pink's in Hollywood, hoping that it wasn't going to be a disappointment like Pink's. After about 20-30 minutes of waiting in line, we finally got our order in.There's about one menu that is circulated along the line, and there is a HUGE assortment of sandwiches you can get. I ended up getting the Superman (3rd largest sandwich). Ike, the owner, told me that it was a pretty big sandwich but I didn't think much of it since i saw other people's brown bags and the size didn't seem too bad.However, when Ike came out our sandwiches, he handed me one bag and told me that it was just my sandwich. HOLY CRAP!!! My sandwich = 2 of the regular sandwiches. As for the sandwich, the combination of the different meats + dirty sauce + dutch crunch was a wonderful combination of flavors. The dutch crunch didn't hurt the roof of my mouth like other sandwich places do. I recommend taking the small walk to the park nearby and enjoy a nice day with a sandwich from Ike's.
I've always wondered "how good can a sandwich be? A sandwich is a sandwich!" but oh man Ike's place proved that wrong.. The menage e trois is no joke! Not overhyped at all it is seriously THE best sandwich I've ever had. The sauce perfect! What really makes these sandwiches stand out is the Dutch crunch bread.. It's chewy yet still has that crunch.. So delicious! I've heard that phone orders tend to be faster but it was my first time there so I just waited in line which wasn't too bad. They give a bag of chips and a caramel apple lollipop with each sandwich you order. There's no tables inside so you pretty much take your sandwich and leave. I shared the mnage a trois(AMAZING), nacho boy(good, but not too special), and the spiffy tiffy (pretty good flavors) with a few friends and we all agree that Ike's is a must go to place whenever you're in San Fran!
I just had a life-changing experience here.I had the Menage-a-Trois, and I will never be the same again. It was hands down, the best sandwich I have ever devoured in 4 minutes.My buddy called in our orders and we went to pick it up. It was a little pricier than the sandwiches we usually get, but worth every penny. 5 stars.
I recieved excellent and quick service for my 2013 Chevy Cruze at Capitol Chevrolet off the parkway in Salem
What can I say that hasn't already been said?Order ahead or you may stand in line for awhile and there is limited seating while you wait.
The sandwiches were delicious and no kidding about the wait. Good thing we called in our orders to just pick up. So why the 2 stars? Well when we asked for peppercinni we found Bugs in our batch =( Kind of made us question the prep area. Meh we were starving and took our chances. Will we come back to this location? No... sorry
I really, really liked Ike's. I finally made my way over to Ike's (I absolutely loathe driving into the city, so I try to avoid it all costs). It was absolutely worth the wait and the drive though.I got the "MILF" (pulled chicken, hot wing sauce, stuffed jalapeno peppers and ranch. I also had a chance to check out the "Name of the Girl I'm Dating," (chicken, honey mustard, avocado, pepper jack) and the "San Francisco Cheesesteak." They're just really freaking good sandwiches. And for their size and the fact that you get a bag of kettle chips and a lollipop with it, isn't really as overpriced as some make it out to be. Ahh, refreshingly how sandwiches should be done.
Yesterday I went with my sis-in-law to the Castro to look at architecture for her work. I brought my camera to take pictures of all the sights... and the buildings. After we were done I told her we should find somewhere to eat around there to try someplace new in that part of town. I got on my trusty Yelp mobile app to find places and *bam*, Ike's Place pops up with 4.5 stars and 1000+ reviews. I had heard of this place before, from whom I don't remember, but we had to try it.Looking at the menu there were a few interesting choices I wanted to try, but one caught my eye, the "Going Home for Thanksgiving." It was dutch crunch bread, turkey, cranberry sauce, sriracha sauce, havarti cheese. Seeing this sandwich took me back to a few months ago to the pleasant memory of riding bikes around SF with my native SF friend as I was looking at "For Rent" signs and places to live in the Sunset and Richmond areas. We made a quick food stop at some sandwich shop somewhere I don't remember where and while I ordered a crappy breakfast sandwich, well since it was breakfast, my friend ordered the turkey and cranberry, which was really good. Thankfully she shared half of her sandwich with me. So with that inspiration I had to get it... and it was incredible. And the bread? Wonderful. I offered to share half of my sandwich with my sis-in-law, and well thankfully she didn't want any haha. The sandwich was huge but I had to finish. Finishing hurt, but in a good way. And it comes with some wonderfully crispy chips.
It's been just about two years since I first reviewed Ike's and I am compelled to update because:* The MILF. Holy crap. Best sandwich I've ever eaten in my whole entire life.* Even after his success and all the rave reviews and being featured on Man vs. Food and the CROWDS of people swarming his sandwich shop whenever I drive by hoping against hope that maybe, just this once, I could park and pop in for a quick sandwich, Ike is still as nice as ever.
Shoot! I just started to do some final planning for my Emerald Bowl weekend by reviewing my San Francisco bookmarks only to discover that I never wrote a review for Ike's Place. I know what you are thinking, "BFD!", right? A lot of people take their own sweet time to write a review. Well that might work for most restaurants but Ike's Place is so amazing that not reviewing it immediately would be like spending the night with Carmen Electra and forgetting to tell your friends about it for three months. Yes, a sandwich from Ike's Place is in the same category as sex with Carmen Electra. So if you haven't figured it out from the other 1500+ reviews before mine, the sandwiches at Ike's are amazing. Warm, full of flavor and a darn good bargain. Anyone can tell you which sandwich is their favorite and do you really need another subjective opinion? Here's my proof as to why you need to go to Ike's Place. I was in San Francisco with the girlfriend, J, and my parents. My parents are not the most adventurous eaters and like most 60-somethings they want convenience when it comes to a meal. So imagine the battle I had with them to visit an unknown sandwich shop in the Castro District. First off there was a Castro Street fair going on so in addition to there being no place to park my right wing conservative Orange County parents saw more drag queens and old dudes in buttless chaps than they could ever imagine in one spot. Additionally we had to wait 15 minutes to order and another 20 to get our food (and I was told that was a short wait for both). I think it took my parents about two bite of their sandwiches before they proclaimed Ike's Place as the best sandwich shop on the planet. Look at mom and dad stepping up to the hip crowd.I guess my only real recommendation is to try the Dutch Crunch bread. San Francisco is famous for their sourdough but in my book Dutch Crunch is the new bay area institution for sandwiches.
I gave Ike's 5 stars even though we had to order our sandwiches 4 hours in advance... it's just that good. It's hard to find quality corned beef, but the Paul Reuben SET IT OFF. Great corned beef with some fresh cole slaw and all the accoutrement. The sandwich was thick, juicy, and amazing. Ike's is the spot for sandwiches!
OMG. Delicious. The Menage a Trois - I didn't think I would like all that cheese on my sandwich, but damn, it was GOOD. Line is around the corner, but they sometimes have entertainment to keep you there. Love love love.
It's been a crazy year for Ike's. Kicked out, reopened in temporary quarters, and then reopened for real in bigger digs.And, now that they have all this new space, I've been able to walk in, order a sandwich, and walk out with it in 20 minutes. On a weekend. At lunchtime!Either the crazy crowds have diminished to a reasonable level, or they've found a bunch more magic sandwich fairies to assemble those things, or both. However it worked out, I'm happy. And Ike's is delicious.
What can I say that everybody else hasn't, its amazing. My only complaint is the wait. Each time I called it was a 40 minute wait for a sandwich oh and I could've used a little more sauce on my vegan meatball sandwich. Nevertheless, you must try it on a french roll because it is delicious.I've never been to a sandwich place that has as many innovative and vegetarian sandwiches as Ike's! If only the wait was shorter I'd be going there every week! Last but not least everyone working there is very friendly!!
So, i really don't know if it was my faut for ordering the wrong sandwiches, because i got 3 kinds, that sounded totally different on the menu, that somehow turned out to taste all the same.My BF's though was delish! He got something of the philly cheesesteak sort of thing. Very good.The next time i'm in SF, I'll stop by this place again, but i'll make sure to ask if i got 3 of similar tasting things ^_^Oh and also, clean up the carpet will you? it looks super dirty! Also, the place looks super run dow, especially with the popularity of this place, they sure make a shit load of money. You can afford to renovate your place, that's for sure.
SF Signature for sandwiches
I'm sure the sandwiches are still great. But when I walked by the other day there were seriously 50 people waiting in line.I'd try calling ahead but that's always unreliable at best. And even when calling the wait time is over an hour. And that's if they answer the phone and don't put you on hold for 10 minutes.I can't justify the wait at this place anymore. It's just too popular now. Sad.
Got a MILF and it was BOMB. Jalepeno poppers (no, not jalepenos, but jalepeno POPPERS) on dutch crunch and delicious chicken. Possibly the best sandwhich I've ever had. There wasn't really much place to sit in there, so we went over to the school and sat down on the steps. Headed over to Bi-Rite afterwards. Highest delicious-density night ever.Went with some friends who were Muslim and it is *Halal*!!Price was $12. Call in beforehand, and you will have NO REGRETS. (comes with a delicious green apple caramel lollipop too).
My husband was itching to try this place after we saw it on Man v. Food, so we went on one of our visits to the city.I really wanted to like this place. Especially after all the sandwich combinations I read. I decided on the Lincecum which was ham, turkey, havarti, bacon and avodcado. Sounds simple and a safe choice yes? So what was wrong with it? It was warm. And I don't think it was supposed to be warm. The warm bread, I get but the havarti and ham and turkey and avocado piled on was a tasteless mush. The condiments were gooey. The "dirty sauce" was good but mixed with the mayo that tasted like it was sitting out all day, just made it entirely too salty. Props for the chips that came with the sandwich and the speedy and smiley service on a super busy Saturday. And this goes without saying but if you're just visiting from out of town (like we do) parking is a bitch, just like everywhere in the city.I should let everyone know however that my husband had the Cain and loved it. HE would go back again.
Kryptonite. Need I say more? Fine, okay. Sandwiches are ginormous and the combination of flavors are amazing. My other favorites are Matt Cain and Lex Luthor.
do i like waiting in lines? : no.do i like ike's sandwiches: yes!this is obviously a San Francisco staple, as iconic as the painted ladies. it's a must stop! :) i love their Barry Z sandwich, but the lines can be crazy and by no means is it a "light lunch". Prepare to food coma afterwards. Also be ready to wait an hour for your sandwich!
Truly one of the most disgusting sandwiches I've ever eaten in my entire life. Bar none. In fact of the three sandwiches we got, only one of them was oh kay. 2 of them were 75% mayonnaise. Beyond the fact that is absolutely disgusting, it never even mentioned there was mayo on each respective sandwich on the menu. So BEWARE and ask! We'd gone to Golden Gate Park w/ the sandwiches so we were too far away to bring them back. I'd gotten the cheesesteak w/out cheese. It was supposed to contain mushrooms (of which it contained maybe 3 or 4 puny shreds), and grilled onion (of which I saw 3-4 pieces the size of a rice pellet). There was a small amount of meat on the sandwich and literally scoops and scoops of mayo on each side of the pieces of meat. I did everything I could to wipe off as much of it I could, kind of like wiping a baby's butt. If you squeezed the sandwich it would burp up piles of mayo. It was truly gross. My sister's sandwich was the same way. She was jokingly competing w/ me to determine who had more mayo. Her veggie sandwich had almost no veggies.The reuben was oh kay if not enjoyable. If you love mayo sandwiches (to the point where it actually was absorbed into the bread so the bread was super greasy), then this is the place for you. I do not get what the hubbub about this place is. Particularly, in a city where people are into being healthy, I'm shocked by this place.
The sandwhiches are legit... it is true. But really you are paying for the hype. The sandos are not so out of this world to justify spending 15 bucks on lunch if you get a bag of chips and a drink. Serriously, you would think that they were use to feeding the Pentagon with the out of this world mark up. If I lived in a place without a good sandwhich shop I could understand that but I can go to Ted's Deli and get 90% of the sandwhich for 1/2 the price.
I can't say that I can give a fair review yet since I've only been here once, but after getting 3 sandwiches the grilled cheese on dutch crunch was the best out of the 3 we got. Probably because we all shared it in the car as soon as we got out of there and it was pretty yummy. Munching on chips while waiting wasn't so bad, but it was a bit of a wait. My 'Pizzle' sandwich wasn't that great by the time we drove home to eat it and that was too bad. The halal chicken was really dry on it so next time I guess I'll stick to the grilled cheese on dutch crunch maybe. Too bad the place isn't big enough for dining tables.
Keep this short an brief. 5/5 stars. Good service, good choices, good sandwich. Hands down these folks just know how to make a amazing sandwich. They can make bread an cheese go a long way. Prices aren't that bad relative to the proportion. The taste more than makes up for this.If you're in San Francisco definitely come here at least once. It does live up pretty decent to its TV hype.
Bohemian style joint serving dozens of sandwiches made with love. My "Tony Soprano" was good, but it didn't rock my world. Ike's Place is definitely worth a try.
I had heard so many great things about Ike's Place I think my expectations were just set too high. I ordered my sandwich for pick up at 10:30 one Sunday morning and was told my sandwich would be ready by 1. While I think waiting that long to get a sandwich if ridiculous, I was already aware of this fact and expected it. I got the Ex-Boyfriend (Salami, Bacon, Avocado, Cheddar) on sourdough bread. Picked up the sandwich, got to meet Ike (he was a really nice guy) and went home to eat. The sandwich was alright. I really wouldn't say it was anything special. Just a sandwich in my opinion. I could only eat half and it sat in my stomach like a rock for about an hour or two after I finished eating it. Meh. All in all Ike's Place is good, but it's just a sandwich shop. I've had way better sandwiches at other places. I just think it's more hype with this place than actual quality. With the long wait in line or the ridiculous wait for call in orders I don't think I'd go back anytime.
Today was a hot summer day, in b/w the World Cup and the Giants vs A's game. Brought a few of my friends, bro, and cuz here for a pre-game meal before we headed to AT&T Park. I had to break free from the Japanese and pho formula we seem to get stuck on. Given ballpark food nowadays, I'd rather spend my money on something a little bit better than stale and limpy overpriced garlic fries that give you bad breath no matter how many mints you chop on! So, trek to Ike's it was....At work, we do a food run for lunch here sometimes. Through the years, It seems like their menu has expanded A LOT...and according to street legend...it will keep on growing!Given this place is popular as hell for years....ever since it was featured on the Travel Channel, well now everyone and their mother is dropping by to get their grub on! The wait in line before we actually got to the door and place our order was about 50 minutes. Ample enough time to start talking to your line mates. After placing our order, the wait for our sandwiches was about 20 minutes. So, in total we waited about an 1 hour and 20 minutes start-to-finish. What surprised me the most is that when you got the door got a glimpse of what was inside the shop - there is no counter or seating, just a register to the next to the door and a busy swarm of Ike's troops making sandwiches.With the sandwiches, you get chips and soda's extra all in all for about $12. I got the Say Hey on Dutch Crunch.  Foodie heaven! I think what makes Ike's different from the rest is the quality of ingredients and of course, their "dirty sauce."  However, you've been forwarned - it can be food coma inducing. Sharing with a friend is a must, but if you'd rather have a sandwich just for yourself...that's okay too - just be prepared for the afternoon siesta!Despite the hefty price and Great America-like wait, all in all it was well worth it. Being out the sun was an added benefit! My advice - if you can call ahead and do a pick up if you can. Otherwise, just make the time it will be a great experience for you and your tummy! Also, if you read the recent article about Ike's on SFGate, be kind to their neighbors.
I saw this place on Man vs Food and had to try it for myself. I called in my order and was glad I did! This hole in the wall Parthenon of Sandwich Miracles had a line down the block! And after eating it, I would happily wait for an Ike's sandwich again.I ate the Hella Fat Bastard, because how many times can you say Hella Fat Bastard without it being offensive?  The thing was amazing! The menu is kind of.....extensive I guess is the right word, but that just means they have a little something for everyone and you can go back again and again and try something new. For real, do yourself a favor and give this place a try...but you are impatient when you are hungry and your experience will be ruined by waiting, call ahead and go pick it up!
I couldn't decide if this was a 4 star or a 5 star. Let's say 4.5 I came here one day because a bunch of my friends were meeting up here for lunch. However, I couldn't make it on time because I was busy right before so when I got there they were pretty much done eating. I decided to order my sandwich and just take it home. The place is pretty small and the line goes out the door. But they have menus on the outside of the window and also in paper so you can look at it while in line and order right away. I had ordered the [Name of the Girl I'm Dating] which was pretty darn good. I got my sister the Menage a Trois which was also good. I'm not sure if I liked hers or mine better. And then I got my brother the Pizzle which he said was good but not great. Although there is a good explanation for that. The sauce they use for the sandwiches was leaking on the way back home. So when we decided to eat them they were a bit soggy. But we just put them in the oven and retoasted them and it was still good! Oh, and the sauce is AMAZING. I'm sure that's what makes the sandwiches what they are. You also get a free chip bag and lollipop (apple caramel lollipops, yum!) that comes with your sandwich. The sandwiches are pretty pricey though. About 10 dollar sandwiches each. But I think they're worth it. That's also where the one star gets lost because I would not come back too often. I would return here but would not be a regular because it would cost too much!
I keep hearing about these amazing sandwiches. It was even on TV! I FINALLY had the time to go to SF and try out Ike's Place. Just as warned, it was swarming with people outside it's little "deli"I remember reading that you can make your order over the phone. So we drove there, looked at the menu on the iphone, parked, phoned in our order and walked around Castro for an hour.I'm glad we didn't have to wait in the long line just to order and then wait some more for the sandwich.JUST AS PROMISED, they were amazing. I ordered the "hot date to hire" which includes thinly sliced rib eye, jalapeno poppers, and their famous dirty sauce (along with everything that comes with a sandwich like peppers, onions, etc etc) all on dutch crunch.There were so many flavors, textures, and the bread was warm and toasted.Most of the people that were waiting for their sandwiches ordered the Sean Michaels. - thinly sliced rib eye with mozzarella sticks!
Let me start by saying that the sandwiches at Ikes are awesome!!! They get 5 stars. Yes, the reviews are right...they have tons of different options and they are all yummy.Something else that has to be said is that the sandwiches have gotten smaller and the prices have gone up! I paid $42 for small sandwiches that I had to wait 30 minutes for!!!! That's crazy!! Prices get 1 star.For my day to day sandwiches I will stick to Little Lucca for a sandwich twice the size and about $5 cheaper.
Overrated and overpriced. Yes they offer halal and gluten-free, but other than that the main excitement is incredible gobs of garlic mayo on a warmed up sandwich. For which you often have to wait more than an hour.I pity those poor people in line who came specially from a distant part of the city....But I'm giving Ike's back a star for finally getting a real location, as opposed to taking up the sidewalk (line of people) and a whole lane (delivery truck) and making it a smelly, noisy, crowded pain to walk/bike on that busy block as they used to. So good for them for renting a real space across the street.
I don't think you can go wrong with any sandwich. Something for everyone and a wild selection of chips and vintage soda pops!
Ridiculous. I've been addicted to the Napoleon since i first tried it. I know there are other awesome sandwiches, but it's hard to resist such a treat. The staff is just freakin awesome, such nice fun people, always great to catch them with things have slowed down and you can actually chill and talk. Good people, incredible food, In my top 3.Call it in ahead of time people =) thats the way to go!
2nd time!! 1st sandwich I got here at IKES PLACE was BAD! I finally remember the name its the ELVIS KEITH! it's like a left over strips of meat mixed with a mayo wasabi and teriyaki dirty sauce. (don't get it)2nd sandwich I got the FAT BASTARD! It's very good.. yummy! :-) but still not a FAN I guess the sandwiches are not FUN cause IKES sandwiches are SERIOUS Sandwich LOL! :-)I think it's overrated!Great Customer service and that's why they stay in business
I had been wanting to try this place since after the Grill Cheese International cook off one of my friends came here to grab a sandwich and raved about it. I got the internet address and was glad there was a menu to salivate over. I made it a point to come check it out. I thought I was going to get a chicken sandwich but decided on a whim to try the fish sandwich, my first. I have never had a fish sandwich in my life and I am glad #13 Papa Sam was my first. I need to start eating more Omega 3 oils. On a flavorful fresh dutch roll braised salmon burger, with Havarti cheese and the unique Dirty Sauce was notable and definitely worth a return visit. Great selection of types of sandwiches to order. They offer an excellent variety of toppings, cheeses and meats for vegans to carnivores. I am impressed that the meat it Halal meats. Halal is similar to being kosher meat. Way to go Ike! I like Ike's Place too!
Just open one in LA already!!.. I hate that I crave for one of your damn good sandwiches every time I think of San Francisco. So good my fiance and I had it 2x the wknd we were up in the Bay. =)Just phone in your order for pickup then plan your day around it. Haha..Imagine our surprise when they told us our order would be ready in 2 hours. LoL. Worth the wait.. but damn I want one now..
I feel very compelled to write a review for Ike's. Does this this place really need another review? Absolutely.This has become an SF institution and I'm deeply saddened that it's being taken away, but I think that will be short lived as the audacity of its hardcore fan base will keep this place alive in some form or another.Thanks for having us! I'll have to make due with the Redwood Shores location in the meantime!
Sandwiches are so tasty! We had the "change" and "menage a trois". Both were great but the bbq sauce on the change, made it a tad betterWill I be going back? yes. Is it worth the wait? yes. Am I getting hungry talking about Ike's again? yes.
Dutch crunch and the dirty sauce is a must. I had the back staggers today, it was good. Their halal chicken reminds of tuna texture minus tuna breathe. The sandwich runs about $10 but it comes with a bag of chips and caramel apple lollipops. Plus its big enough for two people. I had menage a trois, matt cain, spiffy tiffy and the damon bruce before. My favorites are spiffy tiffy and the damon bruce.
BEST VEGAN SANDWICH EVER.... YES E-V-E-R!!!When you eat it you'll have to email me and thank me.
HOLY SHIT. Literally. My butt kind of exploded after eating a Super Mario on Dutch Crunch (meatballs + mozzarella sticks + marinara + DIRTY SAUCE). Although I spent the next day or so wishing for normal gastrointestinal function, this place is worth it. The dutch crunch provides the exact type of gratifying crunch I crave, and the dirty sauce is something to plan my next trip to SF around. This place seems like the norcal equivalent of Pink's in Hollywood, but you get so much more satisfaction as a reward for the 1-2h wait. I'll be sure to call ahead though.
I wanted to write a long an insightful review of Ike's Place, but for some reason I just don't think my review would do this place justice. Therefor, I will just let their sandwiches speak for themselves! But if I could make a suggestion, I would suggest trying their 'Say Hey' pastrami sandwich. Easily THE BEST pastrami sandwich I've ever had! Don't forget to have it on dutch crunch with extra 'dirty sauce'!
if you are in the castro and want a sandwich this is the place to go. not only is everything fresh but the crew is always polite no matter how busy it is - and it will be busy. don't plan on sticking around. this is a place to grab a go; head over to dolores park and enjoy your sandwich. portions are large so bring an appetite or a friend!
What better way to show my love for Ike's Place than a Haiku.Super WarioVeggie Heaven in my PitIke's grub is the sh*t
I'm a big fan of Petite Deli and would NEVER think of cheating on it with Ike's of all places. But I got dragged here one day and the first thing I saw was a line of 30 people! There is no customer service to speak of. The lady taking our order was less than happy that we didn't really know their system of ordering and loitering on the street to wait for our order. There were only 2 tables when I went (I've been told there's usually more?) There were people SITTING ON THE STREET EATING THEIR SANDWICH. This was just too ridiculous. The sandwich was good, but definitely did not make up for the terrible experience. Anyday, hands down I'd go to Petite Deli over Ike's.
It is needless to say how great Ikes sandwiches are. Let's just say Ike's has been my sandwich addiction for the past 4 months after my anticipated first bite. The bread are freshly baked everyday.The dirty sauce (mayo/garlic sauce) and tomato pesto is to "DIE FOR"!!!! I love every sandwich that consist of the halal chickenother favorite subs would be:1. curtis2. nacho boy 3. sexy boy4. eli manning5. mills vikingevery sandwich comes with a caramel apple lollipop. fun dessert! =)Service: Absolutely awesome! everyone there is super nice and friendly.The only thing is, the place is extremely small so there's usually no place to eat unless you get lucky and snag one of the 3 tables they set up outside. Otherwise, you might want to take it home, eat in the car or stand and eat. There's usually always a line but it's way worth it!!!
I finally got to try out Ike's on my visit home and I definitely was impressed. For such a busy business, they were still very nice over the phone and had great service in person as well. They have lots of unique and specialty sandwiches and very witty names for them all. Sometimes I hate knowing that an eatery has a ton of 5-Star Yelp reviews because I hype it up in my mind, really expecting something phenomenal, and all too often it falls short. Their popular "Menage a Trois" (Halal Chicken Breast, Real Honey, Honey Mustard, BBQ, PepperJack, Swiss, Smoked Gouda) is an example of this experience - it was good, and I even got it with extra beer-battered onion rings, but the ingredients ended up making my bread a little soggy even though I ate it as soon as I picked it up and the sandwich just didn't really do it for me. The Nacho Boy Supreme (Roast Beef, Bacon, Mushrooms, Avocado, Havarti) was a knockout though-- I couldn't put it down! I saved 1/3 of it because I was just too full, but it was so good I ended up waking up in the middle of the night to finish devouring it. The Dutch Crunch Roll it came on was crunchy and perfectly toasted, the roast beef moist, and even though they ran out of mushrooms that day, the artichoke hearts they replaced it with worked really well. I called in my order on my way to the city and it was a 3.5 hour wait to pick it up (called at 1pm, would be ready at 4:30pm)! I didn't mind because I already had anticipated the wait, and plus it gave me more time to shop on Haight! If you plan on picking up sandwiches from here, I really don't see why you wouldn't phone in your order, you can just walk up to the register at the time they told you and pay for it. The line outside was ridiculous. My sister said, "It's part of the experience,"... If I wanted to experience waiting in that kind of line, I'd go to Disneyland, not the deli.
um, delicious?The wait is out of this world, but it's the type of place where you just make friends with the people standing around you, because you're all in the same sandwich boat.The bread is SO good. Get dutch crunch for sure. And the portions for fillings extremely large. I could only get half the sandwich down, and saved the rest for breakfast the next day. And it was still, and I quote myself, SO good.If I ever have a delicious sandwich craving that I can't seem to satisfy, I'm coming back here. And I can say with certainty that this is the only place where I'd ever want to try the entire menu, because they've really worked out some thoughtful, magical combinations.
LOVE this place. The sandwiches are crazy good, and super unique. Definitely not the same old, same old... Be sure to order ahead- the lines can get crazy!
From what I hear, this place has been featured on several TV shows on Food network and also Man v. Food, on top of its remarkable 4 and 1/2 star rating based on almost 2000 reviews on yelp. Therefore, I walked into Ike's with high expectations.Oh wait, I couldn't manage to walk "into" the place because when I got here on a Sunday afternoon, the line was longer than black friday sale at the mall. I have never in my life waited so long for a sandwich. But while we were waiting, a cute waiter came around with clipboards, and told us that if we finished the "14-question" survey, we wll be e-mailed a buy one get one free coupon for their sandwich.Well, the 14 question survey ended up to be actually more of a 100 question survey because each question had like 20 subquestions... and I was really starting to doubt whether my effort to complete the survey was worth a free sandwich. I mean... how good can a sandwich be?The answer to my question came about an hour later. After 45 minutes in line, and 15 minutes of post-order anxious anticipation... came our 3 warm sandwiches. I remember we got the "desperate housewife" and two others with very long names, and it's not really important which sandwiches we got, because all of them were so damn good. As Ike said when he personally handed the sandwiches to us, we got outselves "3 really DIRTY sandwiches". Define dirty - imagine ham and chicken and lettuce and juice from tomatoes and dressings and their special sauce dripping and splashing all over the place with every bite. That's dirty... but it was well worth it. Really, please go try their sandwich. Please get the dutch crunch, and please forget about the calories count and do try their dirty sauce. One last tip, phone in your order ahead of time, and go pick it up. I learned my lesson the hard way because I didn't believe it when all of the fellow 2000 yelpers said the line was freakin long. You'll get to your sandwich much, much faster =)P.S.i bought an extra sandwich to bring to lunch the next day... and it tastes so good even after a day!!! just toast it for 2-3 min in the toaster and it'll be nice and warm and crunchy again ^______^
First time at Ikes...Didnt know what to order...went with the first thing on the menu (has to be the most popular right?)Was mmmmmmmmm good! Right after the first bite I knew I had to have this again! Very tasty sandwich. Like subway just 100x better (all the fresh veggies and stuff). I will miss Ikes until the next time I get some!
Great service and great food.We drove all the way up from SoCal to visit some friends and they really recommended that we try this place.There was a black out when my friend and I got there and they told us to come back in an hour. When we came back, they apologized profusely for the wait and offered my friend and I drinks and chips (even though we split a Spiffy Tiffy). The sandwich was pretty, damn amazing. I would definitely eat here again.
one of the best sandwiches in the bay area!
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVEthis made my san fran trip worth it.
I stopped here recently with some family visiting from out of state and I'm sure like most folks saw this place on TV and had to stop in. The sandwich at Ike's Place deserves more that 5 stars. It was very good and comes with a bag of chips and they even add a carmel apple sucker treat that was unexpected. In total we first ordered the "Matt Cain", "Paul Reubens" and "Say hey".  We shared a bite and by far the "Matt Cain" was the winner. It was so good we ate our sandwiches and went back in to order 2 more "Matt Cains" and a "Nacho Boy". It must be the sauce because I also enjoyed the "Nacho Boy" sandwich very much. I will have to return again and again...just wished I lived closer to make this a weekly stop.Now the reason for the 4 stars....the location is small and in a neighborhood so a lot of traffic and parking is limited. The menu is not fully listed and what is on display must be their specials they offer for the day. If your not ready to order the staff has no issue having someone else jump in front of you to take their order.  Being the first time there and not sure of what to get, I was told I could go to the website to see the entire menu...which is huge! Also, this place can grow a line pretty quickly and the seating area is small. There are signs posted everywhere to not stand outside or eat outside on the sidewalk. There is a restaurant nearby but the seating is reserved for their patrons so we ended up eating in the car.Happy eats.
Eating here is like what you feel after sex. Just Amazing!I had the Matt Cain sandwich that was on ESPN, and it was AMAZING! The mix of meat was awesome and of course you can't go wrong with dutch crunch. But if you are looking for something everybody loves, it is definitely the Menage a trois. Also, they give you a caramel apple lollipop with every sandwich, which is awesome because I used to eat that all the time when I was a kid.I was skeptical at first because of all the hype, but this place definitely lived up to my expectations. The lines are usually long, but I went in around 3pm when there weren't too much of a crowd. If you are in the Castro, you have to go to Ike's (Btw I met Ike, and he is a really great guy)
These sandwiches are some of the best the city has to offer. And now you can find them all throughout the bay area. No matter what goes into your ideal-wich you will find its even tastier coming from Ike's. Never forget to get the Ike's sauce, its the biz!
Amazing sandwiches!~~~ But incredible waiting time...1.5 hrs.......The sandwich worths the premium cost, but together with the waiting time and parking..............Once in my life is good enough~~~O, some people call in ....they still need to wait for 20 mins... (i heard)
ONE OF THE BEST SANDWICH SPOTSPros: Big menu, good foot, great serviceCons: The waitGood food overall, tasty sandwiches up and down the board. It's easy to find the place b/c of the huge menu they have outside. They have a wide range of sandwiches for everyone's taste. If your a Giants/49ers fan you'll love the names of some of their items. Grab yourself a bag of chips and grub on your sandwich. You won't be wasting any food once you start eating you sandwich b/c its that good. If you go w/someone you'll definitely be taking a bite out of their sandwich b/c its that delicious. The few knocks I have on this place is the wait for ordering the food and receiving food. But once you do receive your food, you'll forget all about the wait b/c the food is on your mind.
One of the best sandwich places I've had! I'm so glad I tried it while I was in SF. I'm sure there is always a wait, but it was worth it. They also have an app that has MORE choices on the menu than what they wrote on the board.
For my maiden voyage at Ike's I got a Fat Bastard, and the g/f got a Lincecum.Verdict: Damn good, no doubt about that. Finally a place that lives up the Yelp hype. Yes indeed I will go back.I am only taking a star off because I had to call 3 times to put my order in, (twice put on hold by Tre Hipster and disconnected) and even then the wait time was an hour. I mean really, people it *is* only a sandwich.Let's do some math. Ikes is open an average of about 9 hours a day. I was there for 5 minutes picking up my order, and I saw about 6 sammies go out the door. Can they really keep up the 1 per minute pace? Let's say they make 40 per hour, conservatively.That's 360 sandwiches a day, conservatively speaking. Average profit on a sandwich? - it's gotta be at least 50%. I once knew these cheap guys running a market dowtown making 50 cent sandwiches and charging 4 bucks.So anyway, let's say 4 bucks profit a sandwich, conservatively. 4 times 360 = 1440 bucks a day, every day, all day -- from SANDWICHES.Ike is going to be owning this town soon ;-)
People tell me that I cant say something is the best when I haven't tried everything out there, but sometimes a food is so delicious that you know there will be nothing else better. That's what a sandwich at Ike's is like, THE BEST. Flavor explosion to the max! We got there a little bit before 12 and miraculously avoided the line.. I was scurrred esp reading all the reviews on yelp about a 1+ hour wait, but the line was so short that I didn't even have time to read over the entire menu. Not that I needed to see a menu.. I already knew the ELI MANNING and SHAWN MICHAELS or HELLA FAT BASTARD were what I wanted to get. Yay yay( gangster voice) K the Eli Manning is chicken, loaded w veggies, dirrrty sauce on dutch crunch bread.. lskfj a;iehqo SOOOO GOOOOD!! Get it and you wont regret it...The workers are super nice, maybe it's a norcal thing.. but you guys are great! We got the sandwiches, 2 chips- jalepeno and the mixed flav one( I forget the name), and 2 sodas .. really interesting ones I think the leninade and something else that kinda tastes like mountain dew but better.. ask them for suggestions! Then we walked a few blocks to a nearby park enjoyed the sandwiches under a tree.. ~ pure Happiness~ If there is one thing is SF that you don't wanna miss, its this freaking sandwich!
The juiciest sandwiches out there! Highly recommend. I've never had a bland sandwich. Very large selection too! Yum!
Delicious, worth the wait, very generous serving sizes. Amazing.
Havent had a bad sandwich there. Extremely flavorfull. I steal my girlfriends half whenever I get the opportunity. NOMNOM
The Best Damn Sandwich Period!I highly recommend calling in your order though. We called in around noon and they said the soonest they could get our two sandwich order was 2:30! So, order a couple hours before if possible.I ordered the Mnage  trois and it was the best sandwich I've ever had. I expected it to be soggy after the 30 min it took me to get back home, but NOPE, it was still amazing.Highly Recommended! Nom nom nom
Ike's is pretty good. You'll have to wait in a gigantic line though, which is annoying. While waiting in line we felt like idiots because people who had phoned ahead were getting their orders right away. In retrospect, we should've called in our orders from the line itself and we would've gotten them sooner than we did by actually waiting in the line.So I won't be back unless they come up with a less retarded system or suddenly become not massively crowded.Good, but way overrated.
I love Wichsands, I love them alot! Wichsands are my FAVORITE!I could eat sandwiches 7 days a week and never get sick of it, believe me, I've done it NOT because I HAVE to, because I was craving for it. I know sandwiches and how I like them.My favorite are toasted COLD sandwiches. Ike's Place swayed me into hot sandwiches.WOW, it was a damn good sandwich. After eating a buffet earlier, I wasn't really hungry, but i gobbled up the thing quick-style. The bread, sauce, meat and people working there are top notch.I didn't mind the wait, a line equals a good place to eat. My next quest will be a "Superman," wichsand.
The City is littered with the best, highest quality of all sorts of food, but one. SF is starved for junk food (and no, fussy organic blueberry-basil cupcakes are not junk food). This place really "hits the stop" when it comes to decadent, generic-sourced, sloppy sandwiches. It's a guilty pleasure down a culinary dark alley in an otherwise pious city. The lure is the overstuffing of bread, where mayonnaise acts as a side dish. The sandwiches are tasty, but nothing extraordinary or particularly unique. Other cities in the US boast memorable gluttonous foods that rest low on the haute cuisine totem pole (think cheesesteaks, po' boys, hot dogs), all best consumed after several pints of beer (or bongs of grass). But this place's appeal is as bizarre as the seemingly sober characters waiting in line.
Went here on a Saturday and went BACK on Sunday. the sandwich's here are really good. they can put just about anything on your sandwich... and I mean ANYTHING from friend mozzarella sticks to jalapeno poppers. It is a good treat, you can share 1 sandwich with 2 people or be greedy and eat 1 by yourself... I suggest being greedy as the sandwich is that good that you don't want to share....ENJOY!
Lines out the door. Awesome sandwiches. They taste great, despite the low-quality ingredients - why? Because they have awesome sauces and incredible options for add-on items. They also give a bag of chips with the 'wich. But $10-15 for a sandwich is not only not worth waiting in line, it's not worth my consideration. Go here if you want overpriced but delicious sandwiches.
THE BEST SANDWICHES IN THE BAY!!!That is all I really have to say besides that I met the owner. I forgot his name but he seemed real awesome. He shared his favorite sandwich on the menu and other details about his awesomely delicious sandwich plans. Ordered the Menage Trios and the Paradise Found. Absolutely magnificent taste! Everything in the sandwich including the sandwich as a whole was just so dope! I can't even begin to explain how it taste in my mouth. The meat was literally melting in my mouth. The pineapple was as sweet as I. The Menage Trios, three different cheese with three different sauces. I was having an oral-gasm in my mouth. Is that Yelp appropriate? Oh well. I'm reviewing what it felt like and that's exactly how it felt like!!!I asked Ike (I was kidding about the comment above), if he would open in the East Bay and he said if they call him. So I was thinking of writing a petition for him to expand out here. It's not fair that SF has him all to themselves! Overall, four thumbs up since I was wanted to lick other peoples thumbs. Yes, it has that affect on you. You can't describe it, you can't hold it in, you just want to savor every juice that spills onto your tongue.*sigh*
Ehhhh, I really wanted to like this place. I was here a number of times a few years back and I walked right in, got mah sammwich, and walked right out. And the sandwiches are good....not worlds best, but good. So today I phoned the order in. Busy. Busy. Busy. Finally, an answer...Ikes employee: "Ikes place, can you hold?"Me: "Uhh..." (my answer did not matter, I was already on hold.)3 minutes pass.....Ikes employee: "Can I help you?"Me: "Hi just wanna order two sandwiches to pick up."Ikes employee: "How many?Me:"Two"Ikes employee: "Yeah, uhm that might be, like, a couple hours man. "Me: "Really? For sandwiches?"Ikes employee: "hang on, how many do you need?"Me: "Two"Employee: "Hang on"2 minutes pass.......Employee: "OK , two right, well, let me see....let me put you on hold for a minute"The line is disconnected at this time.I call back, simply to verify that the employee was not just being a silly goose and jesting about the two hour turnaround for sandwiches.  He did not actually apologize for having hung up on me just prior to this. He did however, verify that if I wanted to enjoy a tasty sandwich from this establishment, it was a treat I'd be enjoying two hours after ending our phone conversation. I did not order them. The foods good, but other than the owner, I've never seen a pleasant employee in this place. Here's the other thing, part of earning the rave reviews is being able to efficiently handle the demand for your product. It's nice that the secret ingredient in every sandwich is love, but these are not custom built Harley's. Take a lesson from Sub Center on order efficiency....and hire more, and friendlier people.
I love the menu & reading all the nifty names of the sandwiches. I came here for the first time, not knowing that you're supposed to call in & order.. if you want to skip the 1 1/2 hr wait! It took me such a long time to decide which sandwich to try, because they all sounded mouth-watering delicious. I got the Nacho Boy, which had avocado, grilled mushrooms, roast beef, & cheese. I kinda wish i got something else, because it wasn't as tasty as I hoped.. or in other words, not worth the 1 1/2 hr wait. I'm definitely coming back next time & calling in! .. but i hear this location is closing down soon, if they haven't already. Another downside is that you have to get lucky to find street parking cause it's pretty packed.
Proof that way too many people are way too easily impressed. The sandwiches are average - piling lots of crap into them doesn't make them amazing, it just makes them sandwiches with lots of crap in that make a big mess when you eat them, which completely defeats the purpose of what the Earl intended. The wait is also ridiculously long. Ike - please ask your customers to not use your neighbour's steps as their dining room. I'm sick to my back teeth of having to clamber with my grocery bags through people eating your food on my front steps, making a mess over them that they don't clear up. I also can't navigate the block you're on due to all the people milling about like clueless morons.
The sandwiches are really good, but not that healthy.The wait is usually very long. I had to wait 30 minutes for my sandwich.
Ike's is good.. the sauce they have soaked in their bread is delicious... I didn't have to wait that long.. that I AM thankful for.. since I've heard the horrendous stories about two + hour waits.. INTENSE.. I honestly don't think its worth that long of a wait.. it's good but it isn't to die for.. Sorry Ike's but I don't think you're the best..
1. Meeeeeaaatlesssss Miiiiiiikkkke!!!!!! 2. Ther staff stage this hilarious banter while making your sandwich that is pure entertainment. They're all hooting and hollering and talking about drinking beers after work and having a grand old time just churning out sandwiches all day.3. THEY TAKE CARDS. HALLELUJAH.
Gluten free sandwiches!!There's nothing more to say, Ike's is phenomenal.
I finally decided to give Ike's a try, and called in to place my order for a Barry B. (with avocado, no onions!) I was greeted by a friendly guy in what sounded like a chaotic environment, who warned me that the sandwich wouldnt be ready for a full hour! I was surprised (though i shouldnt have been, from what I'd seen from other reviews on this site.)I dropped by later to pick up the sandwich. Sure enough, there was a huge mob of people lined up outside! I skipped by and went to pick up my sandwich - but the experience was marred when I encountered a rude, coudn't-give-a-damn server at the counter. The guy saw me, sandwich in hand, on front of him, but managed to completely ignore me for several minutes while he served a bunch of guys behind me (clearly regulars) asking them about their choices in sodas, chips, etc. Finally, after I expressed a bit of annoyance, he took my money (but asked me if it was ok for him to "short" me a penny in change. A final gesture of distain, I thought...! ... and arent they s'posed to give you a nickel in these situations...?)oh yeah, the sandwich! Good, very big, and very tasty. And a cute lollipop was included for dessert - a nice touch! (But, in my current cantankerous mood, I feel I should add: really not worth the 11 bucks I spent. And - just thought of this - should I get a free bag of chips with my order? I didn't...)Ike's seems like a pretty good sandwich place, but undoubtedly, it is riding a bit on the hype of the glowing Yelp reviews, and the attitude of some of the staff reflects this slightly self-satisfied air.
I liked the super friendly staff. The sandwiches were pretty good but if I had to complain I would have to say their sandwiches are drenched with condiments. The line to order is pretty fast but the wait for the food is horrendous.  I recommend ordering ahead.Food was pretty good and it was worth trying just to see what all the hype is all about but not good enough to be a regular here.
Give me that dirty sauce!This place is simply amazing! I had the Papa Sam's and the Mnage Tois and was not disappointed with either. Be prepared though, the wait is pretty long. I went on a Saturday afternoon, about half an hour before noon and stood in line for 45 mins. The weather was very nice so I didn't mind the wait. I was happily greeted by a cheerful cashier lady with redish hair cut styled in a blunt bob and she was more than happy to offer recommendations. (thanks again!) The entire staff was pretty friendly and genuinely seemed to enjoy working with each other. The Papa Sam (Wild Salmon Burger, Dirty Sauce, Cheese) on French bread was delicious. Light, refreshing and flavorful at the same time--I was sold upon first bite and would definitely come back for more!The mnage tois (Halal Chicken Breast, Real Honey, Honey Mustard, BBQ, PepperJack, Swiss, Smoked Gouda) on dutch crutch was a little sweeter than I am used to for a sandwich but it was very good as well. It also made the 7x7 "things to try before you die list" though I may argue that I like the Uncle Sam better (esp if I were to add bacon on it).I asked for a side of dirty sauce to try and it was amazing--perfection reincarnated in a blend of aioli, herbs and spices!YUM APPROVED!
I will give this place a 5/5 as a sandwich shop. Hard to find similar places like it.But why set up shop at Stanford instead of, say, Cal? Kind of lame.
You know, I just don't get the fuss over Ike's. I've lived in the neighborhood for 6 years and have been to Ike's twice. Granted, I'm a little less of a sub girl and more of a quinoa person BUT I know a good sandwich when I have one. Ike's sandwiches are good--but they're not that good. Basic bread, basic toppings--and then lots of tasty sauce, tons of melted cheese and lots of meat or fried stuff. Yes, we're biologically programmed to love this kind of food, and it tasted great after a few afternoon beers, but I always feel pretty "eh." after my Ike's experience. I love the spirit of the place--and the fact that not everything in SF has to be a yuppy food joint. But I just can't get my heart into the sandwiches.
Tasty sauce, fresh fillings, what's not to like? I however ask for light sauce since I find it too heavy otherwise.
Not sure what the hype is all about. Don't get me wrong, they make a pretty tasty sandwich but in my opinion it ain't worth the wait. The line is ludicrous! Living in San Francisco with all of its food glory (cheap and otherwise), one should not have to wait over an hour when you can find an equally delicious sandwich probably within a few blocks.
Okay now, I live in the freakin' suburbs -- San Ramon. So why did I risk life and limb driving during weekend rush hour to get to San Francisco? Because I've read all the reviews about Ike's Place in the Castro, and thought to myself, "how good could the sandwiches be? People talk about them like they are the second coming." I had to experience for myself.OMG, if you've read my profile you know that I am crushing on my car. So I don't just go anywhere. Parking is really hard to find around the location of the shop, so I had to park about two blocks away...ayyeee. Yeah, two blocks. I went up to the counter, which is, outdoors. Yeeeaaahhh... I'm there at about noon, so I order right away, but behind me I noticed a line of people starting to form. Yeeeaaahhh... I ordered the Super Wario - vegetarian meatballs, mozarella sticks and marinara sauce on Dutch Crunch with everything, including the dirty sauce. Yeeeaaahhh... I waited about 15 mins. During that time I saw: the forming line at the Ike's register getting much longer, lots of people walking dogs, several gay pride flags on neighboring buildings, a little boy spitting up in his mother's hand (guess he had too much of something), several people picking up to-go orders, the list could continue; I think you get the gist.Then Ike, himself, brought my sandwich out to me. He thanked me for my business. I noticed how cute Ike is, but all I'm thinking about is: 1) the sandwich he just brought to me and how fast I could get it back to San Ramon, 2) getting back to my car as soon as humanly possible. I parked it behind a vehicle that looked like it had been broken into; I wanted to get back to my car asap. So I'm sorry that I was in such a non-talkative state, Ike. It was nice to meet you!I raced to get home so that I could eat my sandwich before it could get cold. SUCCESS! The sandwich was still warm. With the first bite I became weak in the knees (and not because of my recent injury), but because the sandwich was just that good. I had to sit down. I felt a sort of euphoria that continued with every bite. When it was over all I felt was regret and remorse--I should've gotten two!Well I don't know about the second coming, but I mean to tell ya {come close so I can whisper it in your ear} THE HYPE IS TRUE! Did you notice I didn't whisper it?I'll definitely return, and have someone else drive next time. ;-)
Love them, amazing sandwiches great humor....
A good hour waiting in line .. and it went a little something like this:'[THE NAME OF THE GIRL I'M DATING] whose a MILF I wanted to have a MEANAGE A TROIS with said WE ARE JUST FRIENDS'Haha!!PS.As if you need more than 1000 reviews to be convinced this place is as amazing as everyone says.. quit being a Debbie and try it already.
Sf to Hollywood cheesesteak. Get one.
Had high hopes for this place. I've never seen this high number of positive reviews. This place has very friendly staffs and the bread is excellent, but I thought the sandwich was a bit overpriced for what it offered. Wish it was a few bucks cheaper but still good food.
I just had lunch for the umpteenth time at Ike's and as usual it was amazing!!! I've master the art of calling ahead for my sandwich (today's call ahead required I pick-up 1 hour later, but it was a 5 minute transaction when I arrived) The wait says it all - each sandwich is carefully and artfully put together and the patrons know it is worth being patient. Call ahead, grab your sandwich and hopefully you can find a seat outside or in a park to enjoy - it will be moving!!
Good sandwiches with lots of good flavor! Can get busy.
The cheesesteak sandwich on the dutch crunch bread us an explosion of taste! Also, their sandwiches are big and heavy. The only negative (and it's a big one) is that there are no tables for dining in.
I see myself going back 100+ more times before I get tired of Ike's..if ever. AMAZING SANDWICHES! And that is an understatement.
Good sandwiches, but you have to eat them right away or they get soggy.
What can I add that hasn't been said by others? For starters, the quality of the sandwiches is just plain excellent. People may have other favorites, but the pure taste of the sandwich at Ike's can't be topped.So ... why only 3 stars? As you've gathered, Ike's gets busy. I called at 3:45 on a Thursday to place my order and was told I'd have a 40 minute wait. Wow. Such demand, I figured, confirmed how great my sandwich would be. I get there, wait in line 10 mins to pay, and am asked to wait another few mins. What I ordered isn't on the menu anymore, but it had shaved Prime Rib, onions, cheese sticks, and of course, dirty sauce. After waiting about 10 minutes after paying, I'm told they're out of cheese sticks. What?I mean, I know they're busy. But how do you run out? At 4:40 pm? And why not tell me when I order? Wouldn't you know this by now?They asked me what I'd want to replace it (I went with smoked Gouda) and I ordered a diet coke since I knew I'd be waiting longer. I suppose I expected most places to comp me a diet coke at this point, but they didn't . No biggie, just $1, but maybe I expected too much.The sandwich was great. It really was. But was it worth the wait? And the order screw-up? Probably not. Next time, and yes I will probably go back to try the cheese sticks and something new, I'll just add 10 minutes to when they tell me to be there.
Food: 5 starsStaff (cashier, sandwich makers, expediter): 5 starsSpace: 2 stars, nonexistent, had to walk around the block to Peets to sitdown and enjoy food. Value for money: 3 stars, $12 for a mnage a trois sandwich, bag of chips and a lollipop. Mmm... It feels like $9 would have been pricey/only slightly unreasonable, and this was verging on unbelievable stickershock. The same sandwich before they became famous was $10 after tax, so either they raised the price, and they added in a "free bag of chips and lollipop" which they really charged you for. Not cool.The same size sandwich at Freddies or Molinaris for $6, granted not as delectable, but better than serviceable.Verdict: 4 stars. Great sandwich, one of the best I've ever had. Hard to argue there. Better imo than North Beach's Freddies (which I ate at during lunch hour work many days). However, very hesitant to come back for the price/value. One liner: Glad I came, tried and conquered. Will recommend friends but cautioning against sticker shock for a sandwich shop. For the cost, you think you're getting an XL Sando with a drink and table service, but alas none come standard.
Think of the best sandwich you have ever had. The one with that crazy awesome combination of ingredients... And that one time you had it, when the actual ingredients themselves on that one particular sandwich were of the highest quality you have ever had. Now imagine a sandwich five times better than that. Ike's makes a better sandwich than what you are now imagining.
I'd heard a great review from a guy at work and my wife told me she often saw people (lines)? outside so finally we checked out Ikes's Place today; We were quite hungry mid-afternoon and we got some sandwiches to bring to the beach to check out the waves after the recent storms. We got there and staked out a spot on the sea wall on this beautiful day - now even hungrier! The warm sun, awesome ocean and fierce waves were wonderful. We settled in expecting to enjoy our yummy sandwiches. First i heard my wife say, "shit! I told him sourdough"! Then she said "where are the *&%# jalapenos"?! she was also mumbling about how she couldn't taste anything but the goop that was all over everything (apparently Ike's dirty sauce in abundance). She got in a few bites before letting me try it and then donating it to the bird life. The other half went in the compost when we got home and she decided it wasn't worth salvaging the veggies from because she really thought that sauce, 'goop' she called it, ruined everything, especially the soggy dutch crunch she didn't want to begin with. I hoped to fare better but alas I ended up with a very sweet piece of fried chicken that tasted like it had been marinated in Teriyaki. That was the taste of the entire sandwich, yechhh or meh as some now say. When I looked inside I found one little sliver of a red onion! so much for "free extras"; they are too cheap to even add onions to this abomination and they have they have the nerve to charge $11.11 for it too, yikes. Mine also had the white sauce with the inexplicable numbing nothingness that couldn't really compete with the teriyaki drenched fried chicken - so i just ate the chicken and the birds got the rest - what a waste and they didn't even seem to like it either. Both of us were literally left with a bad taste in our mouths and thought even a Russian roulette burrito from ANY taqueria in the Mission would have been much, much better! OVERPRICED, MISH MOSH OF BLAND GOO, RECIPES GONE AWRY - poor Ike has been let down, is he a victim of his succe$$?, it seems he used to make some awesome sandwiches that people really loved. The staff were nice, friendly, helpful and really seemed to like working there. Rose loved the carmel candy pop they put in the bag, nice little touch but it was the best tasting thing in the bag. oh yeah, the dirty jalapeno chips were really good so I will give one star for the staff and one for the pop and chips. overall it rates something we say when something sucks: BUMMER CHUCK E CHEESE ! ! !sorry had to downgrade to one star, really disliking this 'meh' comment, I suggest placing that before one star however, so when a place completely misses the boat you'd have a 'zero' option; it could go: meh - one star - two stars - etc.
Huge sandwiches! I got the Mill's Vikings. It was chalk full of chicken breast and topped with lots of extras and red pesto sauce. The dirty sauce was very tasty! The chips were typical. It was sooo tasty! The combination of the sauces went very well together. The sandwich was about $10. The sandwich wasn't extremely long, but it soooo thick! It had so much meat and things just packed into it.The line was soooo long though! I waited about A WHOLE HOUR! The line was worth it to try it once, but I would definitely call in early and order the sandwich to-go so you can just come in and pick it up.
The sandwiches you get from Ike's aren't the kind you sneak into a movie theater, unwrap and eat in the dark. It's messy..juice dribbling down your hands and face, you need more napkins but you've run out trying to keep yourself clean, everything gets all sticky, but dammit it's so good you can't stop eating it. There are so many options and hopefully you don't pick the one that you don't dig very much, but I loved my sandwich and can't wait to go back for more. Definitely call to order first. It'll drastically cut down on your wait time and make grub time come much quicker!
If God planted a tree that grew Ike's sandwiches instead of an apple tree and planted it in the garden of Eden, Adam would have slapped the dirty sauce straight from Eve's mouth and ate that sandwich himself. I had no idea sandwiches could taste so good.
I love Ike's sandwiches just like everyone else in the world, but I can't stand their customer service! 1-They can't hear you when you place orders over the phone because it's so loud inside - I know it's a small space, but the workers are so loud that the customer needs to repeat their orders - that's annoying.2-They only have one cashier and so people picking up and people placing orders need to alternate at the counter, but again that is annoying- I order my sandwiches ahead of time so I can be in and out during my lunch hour. 3-The phone is always busy, I tired calling at 10am, then 10:30am, then 11:15am, 11:30am and then finally at 11:55am got through to place my order. Have two lines or have call waiting or have an estimate wait time or something, but the current phone system is not enjoyable.I'd love to see these three things change so I can support Ike's more often.
I tried Ike's before they moved over to Lime.The long line definitely made me think twice about trying their sandwiches, but I heard so many good things about this place so it was worth a shot.Waiting in line for almost 2 hours definitely sucked (I was starving!), but their sandwiches are delicious! I got their 16&Market. It's chicken w/ bacon&avocado on Dutch crunch! Nom nom nom! You also get a bag of chips and a lollipop. Those Dirty Chips are amazing. Especially Funky Fusion. And the caramel apple lollipop is a good way to finish off a great meal.It sucks that they had to move, but their sandwiches are so good I'm sure their business hasn't been affected much!
One of my 2 ALL-TiME fav sandwhich spots!!Went and tried the 200.Kryptonite and shared with my bff. OMG, crazzzzyyy huuggeeee, we cut it in half n started eating we didnt even get to finish half of the half-part of the sandwhich we both took. we were so full, n just every bite had something diff flavors since it's made out of : mozzarella sticks, salami, onion rings, turkey, ham, bacon, avocado, jap poppers, roast beef, pastrami, just soo much stuff, great sandwhich!!overall: most def, coming back for more!! and recommended! if its your first time and your with someone get the kryptonite and split it, might as well go big!! trust, not a disappointment.
7x7 100 things to eat before you die#100. Menage a Trois at Ike's PlaceMy boyfriend and I split the dutch crunch sandwich and it was definitely filling! I will be back to try another sandwich with mozzarella sticks =) The sandwiches come with a bag of chips too.Order it through the phone to avoid the long lines. ENJOY!
I've only known of this place from watching "Man vs. Food," my favorite show. It's been on my list of 'eats' for 2 years, and I FINALLY got to try it today, thanks to my cousin for bringing me here. It's a very small place with no tables, only benches. But who needs tables for this place?? Just get your sandwich and leave! The entire time I was there, it was non-stop flow of customers. So many things I wanted to try, but ended up selecting the WE'RE JUST FRIENDS sandwich: halal chicken (succulent and some tanginess to it) & avocados...i also ordered it with everything on it (lettuce, tomato, peppers, pepperjack, onion pickles and their famous sauce). I don't have any other Ike's sandwich to compare it to, but it automatically has become my favorite there. Yay for getting it right the first time! I can't wait to try the rest of their menu, but when I'm not in the mood to try, WE'RE JUST FRIENDS will definitely be my no-fail sandwich there :)P.S. Beware of the naked man that roams around the area. He's harmless, but just don't look down.
i can't say enough about the quality of Ike's sandwiches, so i'll settle for saying very little. They. Are. AMAZING.superman with extra dirty, delicious and well worth the price (as it can be two meals!)only downside: no longer at Lime (mimosas and ike's went great together)
Hollywood's SF CheeseSteak: thin sliced ribeye steak with mushrooms, provolone, the works on sourdough. Still drooling thinking about it 2 hours later. These puppies are hefty. Ingredients are fresh and bread is tasty. Called in to pick up while working from home and at 2:15 pm, they said to pick up at 2:55 pm. 40 minutes for 3 sandwiches. Worth the wait. Walked (ran) it over to Dolores Park Cafe to have it with double macchiato and then finished lunch off with an ice cream across the street at Bi-Rite. Logical, considering it was freezing today. Too many cravings in this city beckon.
SO GOOD! Definitely one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Prepare for a long ass wait though.I got in line at 1:45 pm, didn't get my sandwich until almost 3:30, but since it was my first time I didn't mind so much. Next time I would phone ahead and pick it up when it's ready.I highly recommend the Change, which comes loaded with thinly sliced rib-eye, BBQ sauce, and onion rings. I would get it with dutch crunch bread.
great sandwiches.I charged my purchase, and on my statement I was overcharged by 76cents. But I'll let it pass as a tip.
bomb.com!!! the wasabi sauce and sandwich was on point
LOVED the menage a trois on dutch crunch bread which I got for $12 with a bag of "Funky Fusion" flavored chips.My bf got the meatball sandwich which he loved as well. Everyone in this place is in food bliss - lots of smiles and happy eating sound effects all around. Highly recommend as a MUST try! I will probably have to go back to SF just to try the $20 Dynamite sandwich!
Helpful note: Do go to their website and decide on which sandwich you're going to get or you'll be stuck mouth agape at the staggering choices for half an hour debating on the merits of each sandwich. Oh and then you need to decide on the bread type.. I am pretty much in love with the DutchCrunch. Oh and the dirty sauce is amazing. I've even been able to incorporate the term 'dirty sauce' into my bedroom act. I should probably stop though b/c I heard her muttering 'Oh Ike' the other day under her breath. WTF HOMEWRECKER!!
Menage a Trois on dutch crunch = orgasmic and mouthwatering :).... and you get a side of chips. Nuff said.
Spiffy- tiffy!!! Best sandwich I have ever had... Ike's put together all my favorite things on an awesome bun! Never thought pesto and avocado would be such a perfect pair!!! PS it's to go only- no tables, so find a perfect place to eat before you go.
I'm not going to lie to. The wait is long, like 45 minutes to an hour and a half long. Rest assured, achieving this sandwich nirvana is well worth the wait. Every time I come up to the bay area, I always make it a point to stop by for an Eli Manning.  Halal Chicken Breast, zesty garlic and herb Sauce, mushrooms, avocado, and cheddar inside a toasty dutch crunch roll is what carbtastic dreams are made of. I've tried many a sandwich from Ike's, but the Eli Manning is my favorite.  Other noteworthy ones: Meatless Mike, King Koopa, and MILF. Honesty though, you can't really go wrong with ordering any one of them. Most sandwiches are priced around $8 to $9, which might sound a little pricey, but it's worth trying at least once... or weekly.Service is also awesome. Ike is super nice and brings out the sandwiches himself. Plus, free caramel apple lollipops rule.
Now that Ike's has thousands of reviews and an unchangeable rating, its hard to say anything that hasn't already been said. Alas, after eating many-a-sandwich here I feel an obligation to give them a shout-out online.So its like this: There are a few firsts in life that you never forget. They usually (though not always) include highly emotional & pleasurable experiences. In this category are things like your first best friend, first wedding day, first sexual experience, and first Ike's sandwich.Hands down, Ike's is the best sandwich I've ever eaten to this day. 'nuff said.
Summary:I saw this place on Man v Food. So I visited the website to look at the menu. There were sooo many choices.. I had a hard time picking just one. I decided to go with "The Hollywood SF Cheesesteak" and my boyfriend ordered "Th Mack". On the homepage it said that it takes a while for the sandwich to be made because they make everything fresh.. Meaning as soon as you order.. Including the bread. So I called ahead of time and placed an order. They told me to pick it up in 45mins. Even though that's a very long wait for a $8-$15 sandwich.. It was well worth it. The sandwich was out of this World!! I want to try eveything single sandwich.Food: "The Hollywood SF Cheesesteak" added additional Mozzarella Sticks.Price: Ranges $8-$15Service: 45min-1hr. Call and place your order instead of ordering there.. That way you can just pay & pick up your sandwich instead of waiting outside for that long.Dining: Well I went there on a cold, cloudy, & windy day. They didn't have any tables or chairs set up.
I've never had an Ike's Place's sandwich before since I don't usually buy into hype, however, my coworker did bring pick me up a sandwich from here so who am I to complain about free food?This review is for the *SANDWICH* only seeing as I didn't have to stand in line nor deal with any employees (at Limes' for goodness sakes).I got the Elvis Keith w/ real mayo instead of wasabi mayo & everything but pickles and peppers WITH grilled onions (yum!). I was surprised at how delicious the sandwich was. Though SMALL, yes I did say Small, it was quite yummy and filling. My "dirty sauce" didn't leak through the bread as I was hoping (though dreading since I was still at work) so I feel like I didn't get the whole experience of a jumbled mess of delicious sandwich slopped together.Though I've had better sandwiches, I do believe Ike's wins out in the savory department. Sold 4 stars for their sandwiches (or at least for the one I ordered).
Need not say more. Read the others and you'll know what I mean. Sandwiches are AWESOME. I'd say 4 1/2 stars.Sandwich, chips, and drink during there happy hour.Chips were salty. Cheerwine is delicious. All and all a great establishment.I waited in line and got my food at 45 minutes in the cold wind, but worth the wait my first time. Line gone at 6:45.
5 whole months of un-ike like sandwiches at my university left me so depressed. Which was why I was determined to get my Ike's fix once I got home. Thankfully, the line was a short 15 minute wait, totally bearable. I followed my normal craving for chicken, but this time, instead of ordering the backstabber, I got the Spiffy Tiffy. The delicious blend of pesto, chicken breast, avocado, mushrooms, jack pepper, and provolone sure hit the spot. I was pretty starved, but the sandwich was so packed that I was only able to fit half of it in my tummy. Some words of advice:1. If you are in a rush, or hate lines, call in so you can just pick up your order. 2. just make sure to get plenty of napkins because this sandwich, like most ike's, will leave a mess when you're done.
Ike's Place makes great sandwiches. How great? So great that it made two of my friends, loyal hardcore dodger fans, disregard their fanhood and order sandwiches named the SF giants and Matt Cain. Ike's sandwiches are made out of the best, tastiest ingredients and they are monsters. There is a ton of meat but its a good balance of meat, veggies, bread and of course dirty sauce.The line can get pretty long and street parking is the only thing around. Be prepared to wait a little for a great sandwich.Overall, Ike's has sandwiches so good they can make people renounce their loyalties.
really really good sandwiches. i always get the MILF. bomb.
Best sandwich I have ever had, hands down. Make sure to get the Dutch Crunch bread.
I'm a huge fan of many of the Scripps networks (Food Network, Travel Channel, etc.), especially when the Bay Area is being represented by credible eateries such as Ike's. I came here with my boyfriend for the first time a few years ago and ordered a couple sandwiches to-go so that we could have a little picnic at Dolores Park. My memory could be cloudy but I believe I ordered the SF Giants (turkey, mushroom, Swiss cheese, avocado, bacon) and my boyfriend got the Tony Soprano (a typical Italiano-type sandwich). Both were remarkable and are now our favorite sandwiches to order from any Ike's after trying some other concoctions. This original Ike's were generous with the size of their sandwiches and chips were also included. I'm not sure if this has changed since then, but I do know that other Ike's locations serve smaller regular-sized sandwiches and have a surcharge for the addition of chips. I'm very impressed that the bread used in their sandwiches are baked to order and also have the "dirty sauce" baked into the bread. This is what captures the true essence of an Ike's sandwich. As much as I loved our little trip to the city for this adventure, I'm grateful for all the other locations opening up around the Bay Area for me to enjoy an SF Giants anytime.
I love sandwiches. It never ceases to amaze me how such a simple concept incites and creates such incredible and delicious culinary creations. I mean it is just meat and condiments between bread right? Wrong. As has been said, the dirty sauce is the main ingredient that makes the sandwiches so delicious. I mean, who doesn't love things with the word dirty in front of it? Things like Dirty Jobs, Dirty Laundry, Dirty Girls, Dirty Deeds, and now Dirty Sauce have all been hugely popular in America. What also puts this place into the Pantheon of Sandwich greatness is the bread. The bread selection is pretty good, but BY FAR the tastiest bread is the Dutch Crunch. For me, it is what makes the sandwich. I had the Menage A Tois twice here, once without the Dutch Crunch bread as they were out. It simply was not the same. The sweetness and light crispyness of the Dutch Crunch bread blends perfectly with the ingredients in the sandwich. Without the bread it is just a good sandwich. With it, it is truly spectacular. For baseball fans, think of it as Performance Enhancing Drugs for the sandwich.My only complaint is the lack of seating here. There might be 5 or so tables outside. I guess you can take your sandwich to a neighbouring park. However for tourists like me, it makes it a lot more convenient to have a place to sit down to enjoy the sandwiches. Regardless, the Menage A Tois on Dutch Crunch bread is the best sandwich I have ever had in my life. A very bold statement, but it simply is true. I also had the Meatless Meatball and a roast beef with onion rings (forgot the name.) Both which were tasty as well. Ike's is definitely a place that I MUST go to any time I am in the Bay Area.
Great food! I loved the sandwiches and believe me, the portion was huge (For me and my wife)The owner (Or manager) was super nice. I didn't know they close at 7 and I called like 10 mins before 7. He asked my name and told me over the phone that he will make sure they will serve us if we arrive a bit late. When we arrived, he came to our desk and checked us!
delicately seasoned chicken, dutch crunch bread has great texture and the hint of softness to it, flavors with the works of my sandwich balanced off to give me a great experience! I order the "were just friends" which is funny really does go with me, and i loved it! am a cook so it does took quite a bit to impress me, theres nothing i could add or fix to my sandwhich. I saw this place on tv, i had forgotten name so i yelped it and boy! now i trust yelpers almost 97% ! almost because some yelp finds have been dissapointing but not this one! definetly have to try the sensation! Parking was not hard to find, but i did come during lunch time on a weekday so might be diffrent other times
I went back to Ike's the next day and had a Menage a Trois, extra Dirty. Eating at Ike's feels like sex in my mouth. Try extra dirty sauce on any sandwich you buy, and call ahead! Waiting in line makes no sense. I've always made early lunch plans and had no problem swooping in to pick up my sandwich with no wait at all. If you're driving, go ahead and double park in the street, I've never had a problem doing so.I'm going to miss you, Ike's. See you when I'm back in town.
Three-stars confirmed. I'd go 3.5 if that were allowed.Had the "Paul Reubens" this time. Again enjoyed the experience and appreciated the quality.In one of television's most famous shows ever, Jerry Seinfeld says, "You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle". I was lucky enough to live in NYC while "Soup Kitchen International" (aka The Soup Nazi) was still in business, and it was indeed one of the most remarkable taste sensations imaginable -- every single one of the seven or eight different soups offered every single day was mind blowingly spectacular. You could order something you normally dislike -- split pea in my case -- and still the overwhelmingly beautiful flavor would knock you silly. Ike's Place makes fine sandwiches (and the staff is much friendlier than the Soup Nazi's!), but it's not in that five-star culinary league and not the value so many raving yelpers led me to believe.I'll surely go back and try something else from among the ~200 choices. Who knows, maybe I'll get hooked and cough up another star...
This place is amazing. BEST SANDWICHES EVER.Whatever you order, try the Dutch Crunch bread. Delicious.Plenty of options for vegetarians and vegans. Pretty much any sandwich they have listed can be transformed into a vegetarian version. I had the Super Wa-Luigi, which had vegan meatballs, jalapeno poppers and marinara sauce in it. Not healthy, but incredibly delicious. A friend had the 'Stupid Eggplant' sandwich, which she adored.It's a tad pricey for a sandwich, but the portion size is large, so you could definitely share, or save half for later.There was a wait because word has obviously gotten out that this place is awesome, so come here and order a little before you get to the 'hungry' stage. The service was excellent, and Ike himself came out to deliver the sandwiches. Only downfall is the seating area is a little on the small side ... I wish there was a park or something closer by, but it kind of doesn't matter because the sandwiches are just sooo good.Plus, they include a caramel apple sucker with the order ... haven't had one of those since grade school!
It had been far too long since I had tasted the deliciousness that is Ikes... With my taste buds and appetite ready in full gear, I called in my order and made my way to Ikes @ Lime (hadn't been since they moved)Lime itself was the last place I would ever want to be, loud crappy music with screaming drunk people at 11AM? No thanks..... I gladly waited outside for my yummy sandwich, thankful that I would be devouring it a home in peace. As I dug in to my Blind Date, I realized a few bites in that it was missing several ingredients...wtf?!Blind date is supposed to have veggie chicken, avo, pepper jack and honey mustard.... plus the onion, tomato, lettuce and peppers that come standard, and at 11.21 it should!But today... Ike's let me down. I asked for no mayo, but my sandwich did not have onions or banana peppers, and they forgot the pepper jack. While it still tasted good, when you pay that much for a sandwich, it should at least include what the description says.... Maybe it's the new hectic location @ Lime, but today was not Ike's best day for me :(
I currently work at a "gourmet" sandwich shop but nothing will be like Ike's. Ike's is amazing. The sandwiches are delicious. The chips and free lollipop are just the cherry on top. w.o.w.
Three words.BEST SANDWICH PLACE!that would be it.Nah just kidding.Ah yes I recall it now...it was only a few months ago that I first tried Ike's place. You know at first I never understand why anybody would wait so long for a sandwich place especially when there is no spots to sit at and all. I immediately take back my words as soon as i took my first bite. I got the Hollywood's San Francisco Cheesesteak and oh man it was so delicious. As soon as you take the first bite, quiznos and subway needs to just disappear from the world. Those sandwich place got nothing on Ike's place. Its almost like Heaven and Hell. A major difference between the two places.First of all, you get to decided on the different kind of bread which is nice. Then of course there is the fact that there are SOOOO MANY different kind of sandwiches you can get varying from Meat to Veggies sandwiches. The sauce they put into the sandwich is just awesome and as I said this is the best sandwich place ever. You can always buy one to go and have it for lunch the next day. It would still be delicious as long as you microwave the sandwich and toast it. :)They also give you the apple and caramel candy at the end which is a nice addition. Overall, if you love sandwiches and you live in SF you gotta go there right now!
I called in my order and it was ready just as I walked in. The cashier was quick and the food was hot and ready. They had a selection of beverages in the mini fridge which I've never tried but I tried a few and they were all good :)There are tables to sit on and enjoy your food. Oh, and chips are included :)
Great sandwiches, long wait! I've never found a place that has so many vegetarian options! Awesome spot if you want a veggie option with vegan turkey, etc.Recommend calling in your order and picking it up, otherwise you're probably going to be waiting for at least an hour.
It has become a weekly ritual now for me and my wife. We used to stand in line at first but we call in for our sandwiches now. No one beats ike's sandwiches in SF, CA or the whole country. I lived in philadelphia for 6 years so for those who can understand, ike's is way better than pat's cheesesteaks. The MILF is my favorite, Eli manning comes in a distant second.Couple of things to keep in mind -  - if you plan to stand in line, know that the wait(torturous, because you can smell the food!!!) is worth it. - if you want to order by phone on a weekend, call atleast 2 hrs before crazy desire for ike's sandwich gets you. - make sure you get something to drink to wash down the sandwich. All that good food makes you thirsty
What can I say about a place that has this many amazing reviews, except to echo what everyone else says?The dutch crunch is amazing. The dirty sauce makes every fantastic sandwich that much better. The meat, the veggies, everything is fresh and tastes fantastic. Will you wait in line 20 minutes (or 45 on the weekend)? Yes. Will you wait another 15-20 minutes to get your sandwich? Yes. Will it be worth every minute when you unwrap that unassuming brown wrapper and get to the deliciousness that is an Ike's sandwich? Unquestionably yes.
What can I say that already hasn't been said? Long-ish waits (for a sandwich place) every time I've been here but it just goes to prove their well-deserved popularity. Um, because of their good sandwiches. Worth checking out....
Heard all the hype... and thought Ike's delivered. Had the Spiffy Tiffy (Halal Chicken) and loved it. It was a good size, and very filling, so I didn't even finish mine (which is very rare).Shockingly, the line on a nice Saturday was extremely short at ~11:45am, which was great.I highly recommend using their online menu/interface to browse sandwiches ahead of time. The setup makes it easy to narrow down choices from what otherwise could be a very overwhelming menu.
Never disappoint best sandwiches in town. afsd
WOW.I took bart from dublin to the SF 16th station and rode my bike the rest of the way to Ike's. So imagine my disappointment if Ike's did not deliver the taste so many yelpers have written about. Luckily, the 2000+ yelpers were right, Ike's is probably the best concoction of sauces, meats, veggies, stuffed between 2 freshly baked sides of a roll in the world. Yeah, world. Food: I ordered the Manage a Tois as so many have recommended and the name of the sandwich was fitting. The tastes played dirty with my tongue and taste buds. The dutch crunch was crunchy and crispy, yet soft inside. WOWOWEEWOW.Service: I called in to ask what the wait time would be as I rode bart, and it was about an hour! So i ordered over the phone, and when I finally made it to ikes it only took about 2 mins and my order was finally done. It was fresh. The dudes inside were super nice and laid back as well. Misc: They give you a side of chips and a caramel apple pop which is awesome! I paide about $13 for the sandwich, chips, lollypop, and bottled water. Well worth it, and a reasonable for the quality you get! Support the small guys!Next time im going to try the "Hella fat bastard" .
Everything that needs to be said about Ike's amazingness has been said. I only have a couple of words to add:CALL AHEAD!If everyone called ahead, there would not be a crazy line around the block. They are amazingly accurate about how long your sandwich will take. And sure, maybe it'll take 2 and a half hours but when you show up, Ike will put a sandwich in your hand with a smile on his face because you CALLED AHEAD.And when you call, get the Paul Reubens. Its goodness is almost as shocking as Pee-Wee's exposure scandal.
Great sandwiches! Don't come here if you want a simple, healthy sandwich, come here if you want the gut-buster version.Dirty sauce, godfather sauce, heaping amounts of meats makes these sandwiches extremely tasty - and also immensely greasy and filling. The Mark Cuban I got easily made two meals - one half for dinner, the other half for lunch the next day.The dirty chips are excellent, btw.
I was curious about Ike's Place since seeing the block long lines for a few months everytime I drove past it. Today on a rainy Friday I thought perhaps a good time to try it out. I waited only third in line to place my order I was amazed there wasn't a long line!I was greeted by a friendly chap who when I told him it was my first time at Ike's he replied " Welcome and this is Ike" and they both shook my hand which was pretty impressive for a take-out only sandwich shop. I asked him what is recommended? He replied "Well there are over 150 types of sandwiches (I only needed one) what do you like?" He recommended cornbeef on French Crunch with dressing and homemade coleslaw. SOLD! It was 12:30 pm and I waited for my order inside keeping out of the rain and watch the line grow about a block long and call in ordered seemed to equal those in line. Ike called my name and read my order and handed me the sandwich saying "Its my favorite one!"I took the sandwich and unwrapped the paper. The sandwich was fairly large and at first didn't think I would be able to eat it all in one sitting. It was warm and the cornbeef very lean, and the colesaw was a nice touch. Excellent sandwich. I ended up eating both halves foregoing the chips and drink because it was so good.Now I know I will be back in Ike's Place again like so many others. Only 149 types of sandwiches to go!(Only wish they had a place to eat in--the reason for 4 stars vs. 5)
Can there be such a thing as sandwich heaven?! HANDS DOWN, BEST SANDWICHES I HAVE EVER HAD.You know how sometimes a place gets hyped up so much, you wait in line for an hour, and then you are disappointed by the final product? Not Ike's. Amazing sandwich-gasms everytime. And if you mind the wait, then call ahead of time for pick-up! PROS: Dirty sauce, variety of sandwiches (and their funky names), can call ahead of time for 0 wait, Ike himself greeting and taking your order, the mouth-watering goodness of every ingredient coming together in your mouth, and free lollipops FTW. CONS: the wait (call ahead), parking is sometimes hard, and no seats except for a few chairs outside. I suggest going to the park nearby and eating on the grass =] Excuse me while I go back to daydreaming about swimming in a pool of Ike's sandwiches... MMmmmMMM..
After seeing Ike's on the Food Network and reading countless reviews, I wanted to believe the hype. I wanted to be an Ike's zealot. Really, I did. Alas, I walk among those who say no to soggy overstuffed sammies. Call me boring. Boring.After waiting in a line that appeared to have no end in sight, we decided to order for pick-up. We ordered the Superman and Name of the Girl Dating. Deciding what to order was a task in itself as the menu lists about a gazillion sandwich combinations. We picked up our order at the designated time and hurried to our parked car to devour our sammies like bingers. Sadly, somewhere between their creation and walk to the car, our sammies became huge sloppy sponges and lacked any sort of texture pleasing to the mouth. I am not a fan of messy soggy sammies. And though I wasn't happy about the money I spent for the soggy messes, I'm glad we had an opportunity to try a Bay Area favorite. Ike's, it's a missed connection for you and me but your throng of fans will continue to keep you warm.
Whoa. Yelp reviews and friends alike were not joking about this place.We took advantage of the amazing weather and walked 10 blocks to get there and it was the perfect warm up for the meal. I came hungry and I had high expectations. After the walk we saw the line from a block away but it moved quick. I would say that we were in line for about 30 or 40 min but it didn't seem that long. They also pass a menu in the line so you can decide what you would like to order. When I got to the register to order I was greeted by a super happy dude named Chase who took my order and was crazy nice about it. They had the Dodgers/Giants game on and Manny had just shown them how its done. I asked what the score was and when they found out I was a Dodgers fan they ribbed me but it was all in good fun. Can't stress how nice the guys who work there are. They seemed to know a lot of the customers by name! That is awesome. I ordered the Say Hey with Mozzarella sticks. Awesome choice. I also asked for a diet cola. Chase told me that the Empire Diet would be the best I have ever had. He was not joking around. AMAZING. Not as amazing as the sandwich though. Where to start? The Sourdough Roll. Perfectly crunchy and soft all at the same time. Not too thick and mos def not too hard. Very fresh tasting. The meat: Holy Shit. If I could find pastrami like that on this side of the bay it would be over for my fake diet. The pastrami was perfectly tender and moist. The cheese and other toppings were awesome too. The cheese sticks added were off the chain! Its not as weird or out of place as you would think either. And the best part about the cheese sticks is that they weren't greasy. Neither was the pastrami. Usually you would have grease dripping off of the sandwich WITHOUT the cheese sticks but not on this sandwich. And the number one selling point for me: Sriracha. This is an amazing hot sauce usually only found at Pho places. But not at Ikes. These guys had it and used it in the perfect way. You have to ask for it but don't fear the head. The garlic will give way and you will experience flavors never imagined in hot sauce. The Sriracha complimented the sandwich very very well. After you order your sandwich should be up in a few minutes. We walked a few blocks to a school yard and enjoyed the sandwiches in the sun. I can guarantee that I will be back here.
After tasting the first bite of my Kryptonite, I immediately slapped myself in the face. It was a dream come true, the biggest most flavorful sandwich imaginable packed with four pounds of the lords finest ingredients. All my sleepless nights of praying have finally paid off. + "God Bless Ike's Place" +Tips: If you go at 4pm they have happy hour and you will get a free drink and bag of chips. Don't be scared of the dirty sauce, its quite delicious.
I've eaten sandwiches in 39 of the 50 United States. I've had sandwiches beloved by presidents (Ben's Chili Bowl on U Street in D.C.), masters of industry (Baoguette on Lexington Ave in New York), as well as the favorites of the folks who shower AFTER work from north to south (Pat's King of Steaks in Philadelphia, Mac's Speed Shop in Charlotte, and dozens of others). I can say without hesitation or equivocation that Ike's Place makes THE BEST sandwiches in San Francisco. I won't say they're the best in America -- that's just too big a label for any sandwich to have to bear -- but in the country's Top 10 without question. A few tips: 1) Go hungry. Ike and his cadre of sandwich masters are not skimpy on the ingredients -- I'm not even talking about the Kryptonite, which probably belongs in the "competitive eating" category -- and all those ingredients are the freshest.2) Don't tinker. When they ask you how you want your sandwich, your reply should be: "Exactly as it was invented." Okay, maybe you'll want to add jalapeno poppers, but don't omit any ingredients -- and for the love of God, don't fear the dirty sauce!3) Be patient. Nothing worth eating comes quickly. From the time you arrive at the back of the line to the time Ike comes out on the sidewalk and personally hands you a delicious sandwich, it'll be about 30 minutes. You'll be in excellent company, so say "hi" to your neighbor and enjoy.
a sandwich at ike's was my very first meal after moving back to the city...and i couldn't have picked a more perfect place! possibly the best sandwich combinations i have ever seen...and everything works here...from the dirty sauce to the delish dutch crunch bread...to the mozzarella sticks and the jalapeno poppers that they put in select sandwiches.yes...you read that correctly...jalapeno poppers in your sandwich. i ordered the super luigi today...meatballs, stuffed jalapeno poppers, marinara sauce on dutch crunch bread. that is by far...my PERFECT sandwich. wifey ordered the superman...little did we know that this particular sandwich is big enough to feed four people!!! the superman consists of roast beef, corned beef, pastrami, salami, turkey, bacon, ham, avocado, and jack cheese...on dutch crunch bread with the works...the dirty sauce just makes the sandwich...super tasty garlic aioli mixed with a bunch of spices baked into your bread and also smeared on your sandwich...omg *DROOLS* my goal is to try every sandwich on the menu...i don't care if i have to wait 30 mins like i did today! it's worth it...the people that work here are super nice...and i love how they throw in a caramel apple lollipop with every sandwich. oh, it comes with a bag of chips. a little on the pricey side...but the quality makes you forget about the dollar signs. YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!! we already know what to get the next time we're at ike's..."super mario" and "pride of castro"....AMAZINGNESS!!!
Come early to get your first choice in sandwich! After waiting for about 45minutes in line and scrolling through the menu to find the perfect combo, I got to the front and they were out of a couple ingredients that were supposed to be in my sandwich. That sucked, but it would have sucked less if I'd had some type of notice before so I could pick out something else. By the time I got to the front, I didn't want to hold up the line scrolling through the menu (again), so I went ahead and got the sandwich sans lettuce and cheese. I ended up going to the nearby Whole Foods and..borrowing...some produce to try and make the best of my sandwich, but it wasn't really salvageable. Ike's, just a tip: if you've got 50 people waiting in line, it miiiiight be a good idea to shout out that you don't have any cheese once or twice! I probably won't be going back here. The sandwich pastrami was dry and I can't fathom a sandwich joint with no lettuce. I get bigger and fresher sandwiches at the deli in my local Safeway! Disappointing to say the least.Oh, I also didn't like that there was no seating. I brought a friend here and we ended up eating in the car after getting the food...Not really the lunch I was expecting.
I loved this place. Me and my friend went around 1:30pm and it was about a 30-40 minute wait. Time went by pretty quick, but if you go during a busy hour I suggest you pre-order by calling in. I ordered their Dutch Crunch bread with mushrooms, tri tip, and some sauce. Their sauce is really good. It doesn't look small to begin with, but it was really filling. Each sandwich comes with chips and I got the orange bag. It had a ton of flavor and was really tasty. A meal will come out to about $10 a head and definitely a good deal for one of the best sandwich places in California.
Go early! We went at like 11:15-ish and there was no line.It's kinda hard to find, no sign on the exterior building at all, but there's an Ike's menu on the sidewalk.The menu has like 100+ items (very overwhelming) but they all sounded good. I got a chicken sandwich with avocado and orange glaze (yummy!). Man was the sandwich good. It was really moist and flavorful with really fresh bread (dutch crunch - my fav). And you get a bag of kettle chips with the sandwich (yummy!)Love this place. Can't wait to try more sandwiches.
Not really sure what all the hype is about. Yes, it's a good sandwich. And yes, there are a lot of choices and some really interesting combinations. However, I didn't think my Nacho Boy (roast beef, mushrooms, avocado, and swiss) was that great. I think, for me, this place is just a place to get a sandwich that might be more expensive than your average sandwich place.
I am not much of restaurant sandwich fan (read: I will make my own at home, but when eating out, would prefer something different). Went there on Saturday (Pride weekend) and stood in line about 1 hour despite being very hungry.To my amazement, it was GREAT! I am sold, and I am sorry to hear about the eviction notice. What we got:What I had:Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian ( = grilled mushrooms, artichoke hearts, pesto, and provolone cheese) with mustard on Sourdough with no mayo & no red onion. What my partner had:Papa Sam = Salmon burger on Dutch Crunch with everything.Both were absolutely delish. Do not skip Dirty Sauce. It's superb.I could do without the chips that come with the sandwich, but that's my problem, not Ike's.
best. sandwich. ever.enough said. go now.
Forget coming on a weekend or holiday, the line goes down the block (literally) regardless of what time it is.Sandwiches are yummy, but you have to eat them right away or they get soggy.Personal fave is the Tony Soprano
Ike,Please hire my friend. Thanks!P.S. Your sandwiches are awesome! And so are you! Aggie Love!!
I said to my boyfriend, let's go to Ike's for brunch, and invite a friend.So, the messaging starts. Ike's? Yeah, let's go, we love sandwiches. No, we've never been there. You haven't either? Perfect. Let's go and we'll meet there.What? Only newbs go and stand in line? Those who know phone in first? Surely, I dismissed this as a lunch time weekday phenomena. It couldn't be true on the weekend. Right? Right? Wrong.Our friend got there the same time we got there, except he walked because he lived close enough, and we drove. He stood in line while we parked.Ten minutes later, he was still in the *same* spot. Ok, ok, maybe he moved up a foot. So we get in line. And we wait. And wait. And wait.Thirty minutes into the wait, a couple behind us decides to cheat the system. They get out of line, and while standing next to us, call in the order. Then disbelief shook the woman's face. Their sandwiches won't be ready for two hours. Ha ha! Please don't cheat the system. It gets you nowhere. And what's worse is that they lost their place in line.I ordered the #59. I forget exactly what it's called, but it had turkey and bacon and salami. I got it with everything and pepperccini. I had mine on Dutch crunch.Beware, there is no place to sit, unless you're fine with the sidewalk. I am okay with the sidewalk, but there also happened to be a loud group of queue jumpers who had flirted shamelessly with the workers at Ike's Place, and were continuing to do so. Less I vomit up my food, we decide to go back to our friend's place to consume our sandwiches.The first bite? OHMYGODICOULDDIETHISDAMNSANDWICHISSOOOOOOOGOOOOD. Yeah, like that. Crunchy, warm, and the best part is there is no mayo. I hate mayo. Really hate it. But their version of aioli that they call dirty sauce baked into their bread is so good. So garlicky good. I could still taste it.Total time from standing in line to first bite of my sandwich? TWO HOURS. Yeah, that's right, I waited two hours so I could eat a damn sandwich. Say what you will, but the sandwich was damn good. I'm a sandwich lover and I think I just found myself a new pimp.Was the wait worth it? Well, nothing is worth waiting that long for (NO, NOT EVEN AVATAR, WHICH SUCKS, BTW AND I WANT MY MONEY BACK, although the 3D was kinda neat). For what it's worth, I'm still thinking about my sandwich. I crave it now. It's entered my consciousness. There is a new standard. I want my #59 sandwich, please.Lesson learned: don't act like a newb and go stand in line. Call your order in, then go pick it up. But, make sure you order an hour or two before you are hungry. You know, just in case.
As we drove past Ikes we saw that there was a huge line around 12:30 so we immediately checked their menu on-line and phoned in our orders. "2 Pastrami Charmed life, Menage a Trois, and one Nacho Boy all on dutch crunch please"! They said it would take an hour- took us almost half an hour to find parking and spent the other half getting a snack at tartines. Back to the the food- all delicioso!
simply wow!!! to be honest i was skeptical at first.. because really, how good can a sandwich be??? after trying Ike's for the first time, i had to agree this is by far my favorite sandwich joint! My gf and i was on a weekend roadtrip up towards SF and other bay areas, and since they accept phone orders it helped us to time things accurately and ordered our sandwiches for pick up instead of waiting in a dreaded 2 hrs wait line.. i got the 'Manage-a-Trois' and the gf got the 'Spiffy Tiffy', both with dutch crunch.. and i gotta say their 'dirty sauce' compliments all the ingredients soooo well! I personally like my 'manage-a-trois' sandwich more than the gf's but i'd be happy with any of their sandwiches! We loved their sandwich so much that we end up ordering 'MILF' & 'Eli Manning' the next day before our drive back to SoCal!!!
Ok! So I'm from Southern California (L.A.) and heard that this place was awesome and it just so happened to be one of the places my friends and I wanted to try out. The day was very cold and drizzling and there was a looonng line (not too bad) about a 15 minute wait. Anyways, I heard this place was amazing. I got the izzy lips? or lizzys lips? Something around that name. I thought it was delicious, although I wish I had ordered something else that they were more famously known for. It was a great WARM sandwich to eat on a cold day.The people that work here are so nice. One of the workers brought out my friend's sandwich and accidently dropped one half of it. He said that he'd bring out another one and we thought he'd only bring out a half. Turns out he gave her a WHOLE new sandwich! How awesome is that?!PLUS! they gave us carmel apple lollipops, which of course would excite the taste buds after that delicious sandwich! I hope to go there again when I go back up to Norcal or to San Francisco .....and for the sake of having friends from Norcal: This place was HELLA/HECKA delicious! (even though you have to wait a bit, it's well worth it)
If Ike were to go to our 20th Holy Name middle school reunion, he would shine and take the top spot.At last, I was reunited with Ike last night after 17 years. Back then, we were'e playing dodgeball and scarfed down Lunchables.Sliding down the Mario Brother warp pipe, we are now both 31 years old but some things probably have not changed. Ike still has the perfect blend of Vince Chase (charming) and Ari Gold (wheel + dealing) from the Entourage.Ike's not in the sandwich business, but more obviously, he is in the People business.Regulars knows him name, and people want to take pictures with Ike.Behind the creator of the "Dirty sauce" which is like a Jay Z hip hop beat with savory,sweat, and sour notes, Ike has had his downs. After previous business deal gone bad, instead of lying in bed, eating Pop tarts all day, and blaming life, just like any real entrepreneur would do, he bet it all again on Ike's Place.Resiliance and self study pays off. Nothing is by accident, the long lines, employee leadership, every details potrays the creative master mind of Ike himself, he's brilliant.A long line that rivaled the unemployment line set up Great Expectations.Aside from having hot female sandwich makers, "are they any good?"#52 The Napolean Complex Turkey delivered a comfort food note. Served on warm French bread, the flavorful Dirty Sauce welcome my palate. Nutty notes from Harvarti combined with turkey and creamy avocado is like a Warm hug that vaporizes the ill senses from the fog. Spicy wasabi sauce amplified the taste in the Elvis Keith, which included halal chicken with sweet teriyaki sauce. Served on a sweet crunchy Dutch crunch, GAME OVER...simply lovely.Perhaps Ike's Place is more than just a sandwich place, it is a class act story resmembling the Amercian dream. So Yelpers, if you have cards stacked against you life right now, damm it.Grab a sandwich, thank God you're not Kayne West, and get off your ass and be like Ike.
These guys are a trip.The sandwiches are really very good, and I suggest going before 11:15 a.m. in order to not stand in line for a really annoyingly long time.May dirty sauce live on forever.
First off, didn't mind all that much waiting in line as it's in a great area for people watching (btw, found out later you can call ahead, hooray!). Secondly, the people who were running the place were super nice and you could tell they were working real hard to run the Ike's sandwich machine. Gotta give 'em props. Now on to the sandwiches...So, having heard good things about the Manage-a-Trois on Dutch crunch, I grabbed that and my boyfriend got the Not Tonight, I Have a Headache sandwich, while not forgetting to mention that it reminded him of me. Aw, guys always know how to say the right things!Anyway, why the three stars? I forget what exactly was in the Not Tonight sandwich, but I remember the taste, and it tasted exactly like my sandwich (chicken and lots of dirty sauce)! Don't get me wrong, they were tasty sandwiches, but I think the dirty sauce was a little overwhelming in both and was unfortunately all I could taste. With all the yum-tastic ingredients in both you would hope that there was something unique to distinguish the two. Also, keep in mind that with all the sauce, you have to eat the sandwiches pretty quickly as they become a soggy mess soon after.Another thing was that the sandwiches were pretty heavy and greasy, making me feel like I had a brick in my stomach after. Obviously, it was probably my fault for choosing the sandwiches that I did, but just fyi, these sandwiches are not for the faint of heart.I'm definitely willing to go back and try a few different sandwiches, though the ones I tried didn't exactly leave me craving more. But one day, when I do, I'm sure I'll eventually find a sandwich that's to die for from their ridiculous encyclopedia of a menu.
i probably cannot add anything to the already stellar reviews of this place. the first time we walked by, we didnt know what this place was. we saw policemen getting in line. the line was so long! we decided to come try the sandwiches on a friday lunch and the wait was not too bad. they only have two old menus to pass around in addition to the one inside on the board. i decided on the napoleon which is turkey, avocado, cheese and some sweet honey mustard sauce i think. i couldnt decide between a few but i wasnt disappointed. all sandwiches are warm and come with the dirty sauce.ike brings the sandwiches out himself and the bag also had two caramel apple lolipops. haha. he seems super nice and personable.we drove all the way to crissy field so the sandwiches sat for a while before being consumed. but they were still good. so many flavors and textures all in one handheld meal!
Quite possibly the best vegan sandwiches I have ever had. They have a whole vegan section on the menu (and it seems even more choices on-line if you wanted to have a look before you rocked up). The first time I had the Meatless Mike (meatball sub) and the next time I had the Pee-Wee (turkey sandwich). Both amazing - I can't decide which one I liked best. You get a free bag of chips and a lollipop with each sandwich - the guy there even made sure to get me a vegan blow-pop. (PS - the staff is super-friendly).5 stars for awesome sandwiches, nice staff and a location a couple of blocks from Dolores park - perfect to go and eat and people-watch.
After four years of college up in the Bay Area, I've only been here a few times only because I found out about this place fairly late. To be short, if Subway and Quizno's are Toyotas, then Ike's Place has to be a Lamborghini.I absolutely loved the Manage-a-Trois, which comes with chicken, honey, honey mustard, bbq sauce, and a variety of cheeses and veggies along with Ike's customary secret sauce. The combination of honey, bbq, and secret sauce is that perfect mix of different qualities. Kind of like seeing that gorgeous multiracial girl on campus who looks like Jessica Alba or Kristin Kreuk. Or watching your favorite football team score consecutive passing and rushing touchdowns with a defensive pick-six to top it all off.There are some great sandwiches in California (such as the Tri-Tip in San Luis Obispo, and the Philly Cheesesteak in Culver City), however, Ike's place is the only food place I know that is home to dozens and dozens of unique and innovative creations that will leave you wanting more.
If you don't want to wait, (sometimes waiting in that line is the best part....builds up the appetite) call ahead, and your sandwich will be ready to go when you show up....With that said, you should realistically have zero complaints about this place.Food-   I've had three sandwiches here. 1) King Koopa - Not the best meatball sandwich I've ever had, but come on now, Mozzarella Sticks and Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers in a meatball sando??? How can you not love that? 2) Superman - This sandwich was enormous (and you're paying for it...over $12), but honestly, in my opinion, there's just way too much going on inside this sandwich...Roast Beef, Corned Beef, Pastrami, Salami, Turkey, Bacon, Ham, Avocado, Jack. Some people love it; I, on the other hand, feel like when there's such a vast number of different meats in one sandwich, it devalues the taste of each one.....Good, but not great.3) Menage a Trois - Just shut up and order it. I really can't see anyone not liking/loving this sandwich. One of my all time favorites.Service -   Guys working here are always super friendly. All three times I've been there, Ike himself brought out the sandwich, was unbelievably cool, shook my hand, etc etc etc....The guy takes pride in his sandwich shop, and he shows it.Overall -   If you grab a sando, chips, and drink, you'll generally be paying between $12-$15...but you're getting good quality food, good service, and the fact that you have over 100 sandwiches to choose from makes it easy (yes, difficult at the same time) to find one you'll love. I can't wait to get out there this weekend to try a couple more.If you don't want to take my advice on the Menage a Trois for your first time, I would take a look at their menu online before heading over there for the first time.....not easy to choose one.
Okay, I avoid hyped places with long lines, but WOW these sandwiches are really worth it. Yum-o-licious!
Just looking at the menu makes me drool. My friends and I ordered the sandwiches through the phone (which i would recommend you do because once you get there, you won't have to stand in a long line). Be patient because we had to wait 2 hours before they would make the sandwiches ready for pick-up, but the affordable prices and scrumptious tastes make the wait worth it. This is the best original sandwich place I've ever been to thus far. I ordered the Napoleon Complex which had turkey, avocado, honey poppy seed French sauce, and Havarti cheese. The sandwich was on warm, Dutch crunch bread, which made it all the more heavenly.
Their back...I no longer have to travel outside of the city to get a great sandwich, or wait in long lines, for this I thank you Ike's @ Lime. Nothing really to say on this review except that they meet my taste buds needs and anything you order must come on Dutch Crunch and have EXTRA Ike's dirty sauce. Enjoy!!!
Hands down best sandwich in the city. Huge menu that will have something for even the pickiest eater. Fresh baked bread to order and a big sandwich stuffed with everything you want. There is always a line, but if you possess any ability to plan, you will order ahead either by phone, or on their App. They will give you a pick-up time and everything, so there will be little to no wait.
If you think you've had a delicious sandwich and haven't been to Ike's Place, then your experience with delicious sandwiches doesn't amount to a pile of shit. I was a lot like you once; Confident in my knowledge of tasty sandwiches, assuming that I knew everything life had to offer when it came to two slices of bread and stuff in the middle of them. Fortunately my eyes were opened the minute I took my first bite of the menage a trois sandwich. The intense revelation destroyed my concept of self and my entire understanding of reality. My taste buds overpowered all other senses as well as my ability of higher thinking. It was as if I were in my mothers womb again, safe and sound, owing the world nothing. After I woke up on the side of a freeway on-ramp, I wiped the dirty sauce from my face, dusted myself off and started walking in any given direction until I could find something that could rival my experience at Ike' Place.I'll save you the trouble. There is nothing else.
Incredible sandwiches. My personal favorite is the Matt Cain, but I don't think I've ever had a bad sandwich there. The line can get very long, but you can call ahead and skip the line to pick up your order. If not, it's still definitely worth the wait.
Ike's is so vegan/vegetarian friendly, i love it! Tons of vegan cheeses and vegan meats. It's always great to find a place that will make vegan/vegetarian sandwiches. And they are so good too. I had the Vegan Meatless Mike, like a meatball sub. I had read about it once on some PETA list of the best vegan sandwiches in the US. It did not disappoint. Even though the sandwiches are a bit expensive, they are very filling and the ingredients they use make it worth it to me. Plus, the sandwiches come with a bag of chips that would probably be almost $2 at any other sandwich shop. I really want to give Ike's 5 stars, but the wait is just so horrible. I've only been once even though I loved the sandwich because of the horrors of the wait. My friend and I went to the De Young museum and decided to try Ike's afterward for the first time. We knew there would probably be a wait, so we called in our order around 3 PM from the museum. Ike's told us it would be two hours. Shocked, but still determined to try Ike's we hung around the museum a while longer and then slowly walked to Ike's. Finally when two hours had passed, we went up to the door and were told that our sandwiches were still not ready. We ended up waiting around outside the store for an extra 45 minutes. It was awful to have to stand there waiting when we had been told what time to come pick up our sandwiches, but by that time we had invested so much time waiting that we didn't want to cancel the order. So bottom line, the sandwiches are delicious and I love the fact that there are so many vegan/vegetarian options...but I probably won't be going very often because the wait was so horrible, even after calling in the order.
Dr. BethAnn Palermo is wonderful vet! She is very thorough and kind with my animals. I have 5 cats and a rescue greyhound and I have transferred them all to her from another vet. She has a great staff. Once when I had a sick cat, she evan gave me her cell phone number. She is a no frills country vet. We, in the valley are ver lucky to have her! Rosemary McCarthy
Today I had a sandwich shaped hole in my belly, and Ike's filled it up perfectly. Actually, it was an Ike's sandwich shaped hole; having been there before, I knew there was only one place that was going to satisfy my weekend sandwich craving.The only problem is the weekend wait, but you can avoid the line (but not necessarily the wait) by calling ahead and picking it up. Totally worth it. Call ahead, finish your weekend taking-care-of-business and stop by Ike's to pick it up when it's ready. They give you an exact time to meet up with your sandwich.Today, I saw that they had moved the register, and thus the end of the line, outside the front door, which makes a big difference when trying to place an order, decide on a soda selection (Jeff's Orange Cream Soda ("Get Creamed!") is my favorite), or acquire your sandwiches.Seating and parking are both "street", and thus extremely limited, so I like to get it to go.Really, this place is so good and so popular, more locations might help spread the Ike's love.
Great sandwiches, loved the dirty sauce but not understanding all the hype and the long lines?
This is the best sandwich shop I've ever had the privilege of being a patron of. Not only do I love the crazy naming scheme, but low and behold, their food makes the cynical part of me die in a fiery inferno of flavor (and cholesterol, but let's not go there). I think that half a sandwich would do anyone well for a meal, especially if you get the really rich ones like I always do. Brie and honey chicken... yes please! And their dirty sauce seriously must have some addictive substance... other than garlic. I'm sure it's gotta be illegal somewhere, it's sooooo good!The lines are intense. Don't go during the work week during lunch time unless you have a really really long lunch break. Or call ahead, and expect to wait even then.They also won me over with their Happy Hour gimmick, of a free drink and chips with a sandwich. Word of warning - it's not always active. I think it's a summer promotion.If you are watching your weight... just plan to exercise or fast for a week to counteract the richness that is an Ike's sandwich. My friend once got deep fried cheese sticks in her sandwich, if that's any indication of how dangerous this place can be. Only sandwich to avoid is their seafood one... nasty imitation crab and assorted grossness. However, I've swooned over every other sandwich of theirs I've tasted, and I've probably had a dozen different ones by now (despite almost always getting the same ones over and over again).
I came here for Cece C. 's UYE. This place doesn't have much room, however, they have seating nearby you can sit at. On the window, there is a list of sandwiches that are most popular. I have a feeling that whoever named these sandwiches had relationship problems or something. Ex-girlfriend, backstabber, etc.. I can just imagine someone coming into work all pissed or moody because of something. Decides to toss together a random sandwich and apparently it is good and calls it whatever he fells. But, it would be funny if it was true. I bought a "change" which has steak and onion rings. it is really good. The onion ring was a bit soggy though due to all of the bbq sauce that they toss in there. One thing I wish was that they had thicker slices of steak. The steak was super thin. I barely tasted the steak.  The owner, Ike is a really cool guy. He brings out the food to you when it is done. And made sure that we all had what we needed. It probably helped that we were a bunch of yelpers. I am a bit harsh, really good place to eat at. Just I think it might be over-rated.
I had heard of this place from a few friends and finally remembered to check it out when I happened to be in the area. The sandwich was quite possibly the most satisfying thing I have ever shoved in my mouth-hole. The only caveat is the wait, but it is well worth it. The staff is also super-nice.Sandwiches ordered: Hot Mama, Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian, Strawberry Girl (get yourself some Empire Cola too!)
I like ike's. every sandwich I've had there has been great so far.
Ohhh Ike's you saved the day yesterday. I've been going through some really stressful times so I skipped work yesterday, to regain some sanity before jumping back in. Anyhow, I went over to the City (froze my ass off on the Harley), waited in line for about 30 minutes and it was all sooo worth it. I had the veggie 16th and Market, and a side of onion rings. Ohhhh there you are sanity!!! Thanks Ike's, you saved me from losing my mind!
Ike's is the greatest! I called at 2:30pm on a Sunday and picked up my sandwich at 5:20pm, right when they said it'd be ready. i got to skip the long line that stretched down the block.I got the "Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian" :Mushrooms, Marinated Artichoke Hearts, Pesto, Provolone and got some mozarella sticks stuffed in too. It was big and delicious! Cherry on the cake: I was about to throw away my bag when I finished but then I saw my favorite-- caramel covered apple lollipop, yes!!Just make sure you call ahead so you can enjoy your sandwich when you want it.
Had 'The Joker.'1st bite: "what the hell?"2nd bite: My spirit actually left my body.3rd bite: My spirit returned because it didn't want my body hogging all of the wonderfulness that is this sandwich.My husband asked me for a bite and I growled at him like a starved, rabbid wolf protecting my kill.Best f-ing sandwich I've ever had EVER!!!Not for people on a diet.Enjoy.
I hate waiting for food. I really do; I think it's genetic, my mom will throw a fit if she has to wait for more than 5-10 minutes for food. The wait at Ike's place is insane, especially since you can't even go into the store. Our wait was 30 minutes, and I cannot believe I can actually say that it was TOTALLY worth it. Holy crap! That sandwich was to die for. My friend and I always get sandwiches together, and he always manages to pick the better tasting ones, probably because they are all the fattier tasting ones. My sandwich was on the dry-er side, but it was still so so good. That sauce they use is completely phenomenal, and the dutch crunch was worth the palette-scratching pain on the roof of my mouth. The only thing I don't really like is when places use shredded chicken in sandwiches. I am all about chicken breasts, so I'm not a huge fan of their shredded chicken. I'm sure you can order it in the form of a breast though.The prices are very very fair for the taste and size of the sandwich. The line is long, and parking isn't awesome either, but it is so worth the try.I will definitely come back here, who doesn't love a good sandwich?
Living in the East Bay I didn't realize how much I miss having vegan options for my food. I was lucky enough to find street parking close to this establishment. Walked over and saw clusters of people, I tried to figure out which cluster I should be in to order my food.Didn't see a menu but I did see a few floating around in the hands of other patrons and was able to get one before I reached the cashier.I ordered a Vegan Meatless Mike on a dutch crunch roll. That dirty sauce is sooo good on the sandwich of "marinara meatballs" with lettuce, ripe tomatoes, pickles and soy cheese all on a crisp/soft roll.
Worth the hype. Lots of options to chose from, but the staff there is very helpful and very friendly. Have the Dutch Crunch bread with whatever you're ordering. Best way to get your sandwich is to order for carryout because this place gets really busy.
One of the best sandwiches I've ever had comes out of this little place! My go-to sandwich is the menage a trois on dutch crunch bread with red onions, and maybe some more of the free extras. The great texture of the dutch crunch bread soaks up the sauces from the chicken, which makes it so satisfyingly easy to destroy. Since this is in the city, you can expect long waits during peak lunch time. Lines can go outside to the corner and back! (longest wait I've seen here) It is well worth the wait!
Best sandwiches in SF!
Sandwiches are good but fell below expectations. The lines are really long so call in for pick up. Even so, we had to wait at least 15 minutes.Menage A Trois - Don't know it was an off day but this sandwich is WAY over rated. The chicken was dry and the flavor was so so. Maybe I should have gotten this with the Dutch crunch bread but I went with the wheat. Nacho Boy - the roast beef was very tasty and there was a lot of it but the Dutch crunch roll was soggy by the time we got to it and it was only about 15 minutes later. Pastrami-Charmed Life - best sandwich of the bunch, even with the soggy Dutch crunch roll. The coleslaw, honey mustard and pepper jack cheese just melded so well with the pastrami (which was also fantastic) - sandwich magic!If I hadn't ordered the Menage A Trois, if the bread had stayed crunchy, and if the wait was not ridiculously long, I would have given this place 4 stars. At least you get a nice bag of quality kettle chips with each sandwich order.
Usually a place this popular doesn't live up to the hype. I came to the City, grabbed some sandwiches, and headed to Dolores park. Like I said, I was expecting to be disappointed. I wasn't. The sandwiches rocked. Up there in the top three sandwiches of my life. Awesome. (I believe we got the "1/2 spiffy-iffy" or something like that).Will be back every time I'm in S.F.
It's amazing how good a sandwich can be when it's made with real thought and care. My friends and I waited a while for our food but in the end it was so, so worth it. The bread was crunchy and soft, the meat was tender, the veggies fresh and the sauces, oh wow. So good. There is nothing pretentious about this place, which I love. (I really do like 'wichcraft in Las Vegas but it is rather floofy for a sandwich place.) Ike's is almost literally a hole in the wall but maybe that's what makes the service amazing? The people working there are very genuine. I had a great experience and I really hope they open a new store soon so when I visit again I'll be able to enjoy another Ike's creation.
On my road trip I promised not to eat at any big chains or repeat eating at a same place twice. Ike's was the one exception.The first time, we waited in line. The second, we called in the following morning. In 3 of us tried 4 sandwiches and all of them were delicious.It's worth the wait if you aren't in a hurry but if you call in and just pick it up then it's all good! Gimme the dirty sauce!
I dropped by during lunch hours on a Tuesday The taste of the sandwich was 4 stars. Luv the Dirty Sauce. Too bad they were out of lettuce & pickles by 1:15PM already. I had the Hot pastrami, bacon & cheese. My friend had the hot link. 2 Drinks. Came out to a little over $20. The wait time I'd have to give 2 stars:15 min wait to order25 min wait for the sandwiches
This is the best sandwich shop EVER?! When I first heard of this place, I heard it was on the food channel and that everyone had amazing reviews for this place. I was like, WTF? what's so special about a sandwich shop. Boy was I surprised. This place is by far the the tastiest and most orgasmic sandwich shop there is. Their combinations of flavors are perfected and their prices are reasonable.The only downside about this place is that there is no place to sit and the wait is incredibly long to order and to get your food, but the wait should not discourage you from coming here!
I put up with the wait to have an Ike's sandwich before its possible eviction. Two hours after calling in an order, I had a Napoleon Complex in my hands. It was good.I have a sneaking suspicion, though, that all their sandwiches taste alike despite the innards because of that dirty sauce. I tried a bite of the Manage-a-Trois (Halal Chicken Breast, Real Honey, Honey Mustard, BBQ, PepperJack, Swiss, Smoked Gouda) and it tasted just like my Napoleon (Turkey, Honey Poppy Seed French Sauce, Avocado, Havarti).
YESSSSSSSSSSS! My heart hurts but its only because I just scarfed down half a doomsday sammach. My coworker Julie F and I spent 40 Minutes just trying to call in from 1050-1130. Over and over and over, until finally we got a human voice! Hooray! Phoning in was the WORST part about the whole thing, I totally got a major headache. We ordered 10 sammaches total and trekked it to the castro at 1:15 to pick up our sammaches. Julie mentioned that it would be more fun to get "the experience" of going and she was right! Ike took his time and told me to let the people who ordered dirty sauce on the side that it wasnt cooked and baked in--therefore not taste as good. It was sweltering hot inside, and there was like 10 cooking people in a hundred foot space. We had to go back for one of our sammaches. Instead of getting the doomsday we got the superman! Well its only without the stuffed peppers and mozzerella sticks, should we go back? HELL YES! The sammach was really good, extremely meaty and is giving me a heart attack as I write this. If no new review's appear for awhile, I probably have passed on. Ohwell, so worth it. nomnomnom
I love Ike's Place, I am definitely a fan. They have a vast variety of sandwiches they can make; I went there yesterday and tried the SF Giants with mushrooms, jalapeno poppers, and onion rings, it was delicious. The place itself is not nice at all but the taste of the sandwiches makes up for it. I think the sourdough bread tastes a lot better than the dutch crunch. Ike's Place can get pretty pricey though, for 3 sandwiches we paid over $42, a little too steep in my opinion but the sandwiches are pretty good.
I've been wanting to try this relatively new and famous Ike's for quite sometime now. I think it'd be safe to say that this is currently THE most popular and best sandwich shop that the city has to offer. After initially seeing this place on Man v. Food, I had the impression that we'd be waiting in line for a while just to order our sandwiches. Indeed the wait was long for a Friday afternoon... at least 30-40 minutes before we had our sandwiches in hand. The place is super-small which was surprising because on TV it looked a bit larger on the inside. Anyhow, the line starts outside the front door and nobody seems to be able to eat inside. A few young patrons will sit outside on the sidewalk to feast on their sandwiches, this is something I haven't seen much anywhere in SF. Most people in line here on Friday are seemingly young local SF hipsters. Now onto the menu, which easily tops over 200 sandwich choices of meat, veggie, and vegan. Simply overwhelming but in reality actually easier for someone to choose a sandwich to their liking. Looked at the menu for a few minutes and decided that the Menage a Trois would be my choice. My friend decided on the Superman which is actually the size of two large sandwiches, which isn't really indicated in the description. Strangely the girls directly behind me ordered a couple Menage a Trois as well. By the time we got to the front, we ordered the two sandwiches, a Pepsi, and Ginger ale which came out to $27. The superman alone is a little over $12, the Menage is $9, so obviously they overcharge quite a bit for the drinks. I'd suggest for anyone who comes here next time to bring their own drinks since you will NOT be eating inside Ike's. Anyway, the sandwiches are amazingly good. After biting into the Menage, I tasted some flavors that I haven't had in a sandwich before. I believe the sauce is what really makes it special. I had half the Menage and half of the monstrous Superman. If you're a relatively regular eater, you will have trouble finishing an entire superman. By the time I got down to maybe 1/3 left of the superman I felt like I was doing an eating challenge. I finished both halves but felt super full, but it was one of the most unique and insane sandwich eating experiences I've ever had.
This was my first time going here, and let me tell you, the sandwiches are delicious! I probably waited in line for 30 minutes and then another 15 minutes after I ordered. Although it took awhile, the wait was worth it! There were so many sandwiches to choose from and I had a hard time deciding what to eat. Luckily, one of my best friends who has eaten there numerous times, suggested something that WASN'T on the menu. I had the Lincecum sandwich, and wow! It was so tasty! Definitely worth going there again!
Menage a trois or Damon bruce on dutch crunch. Delicous. Huge. Worth the hype. Go.
Ikes must put crack cocaine in their sandwiches cause I cant get enough...I just sold my first born child to get money to get another sandwich.The M.I.L.F. and the Joker are my new favorites....These guys are killin it!I am going there Tomorrow!
I love Ike's!! I bring everyone that ever visits me here. Definitely look at the menu online because they can't fit all of the choices on their walls. I can't help but always order the Home for Thanksgiving sandwich. That cranberry mayo gets me every time. But all of my friends and family who have tried it (and other sandwiches) have had nothing but rave reviews. Go!
I've heard the hype about Ike's and decided to go there on a hot sunny day, on the way to my first Giants game. (No way am I going to pay big bucks for greasy ballpark food. A sandwich it is!)Luckily, there were no long lines that I've heard of. Instead, the small sandwich shop was cramped with boys with pretty mustaches that were extremely accommodating. They offered water and sandwich suggestions, one of which was the "Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian." Well, I'm pretty much always a vegetarian and this sandwich made me a happy one at that.Picture this: marinated artichoke hearts, mushrooms, pesto, and provolone sandwiched between a french roll. The cheese was perfectly melted in between the layers of juicy sauteed mushrooms and zesty artichoke hearts. I don't know what they did, but the cheese was perfectly baked to taste like the slightly charred cheese you would find on pizza. Yum!
5.5 STARS!!  Luckily I have been there during off peek hours. The longest I have had to wait was 20 minutes..or so. I could see waiting an hour though for one of these sandwiches. Hella Fat Bastard to be exact. I hate to admit it, but it has fried cheese sticks in it....and couldn't be more delicious. I even had a problem with my charge, and they totally rectified it when I went back the next time. If all ya'll neighbors don't like it....MOVE!
Ike's HAPPY HOUR?!YES! Mon-Fri. 4-7 p.m., free bag of chips and a drink along with your sandwich. Dude these people are killing me here. Basically, Ike loves you (and me), and we love him and the his sandwich crew back. Oh, and his sandwiches, duh.This time I got the Nacho Boy with the request of dirty sauce and jalapenos. They don't just give you that canned jalapeno stuff, there were actual red jalapeno peppers in there. Seriously legit. And their bread was toasted perfectly.No line + "surprise! happy hour!" = best Ike's day ever
Yup, sign me up for Ike's cult following mailing list. I moved to SF 5 months ago and finally made my way to Ike's today and I'm very glad I did.i don't think there's anything I can say that will make you want to read my review over the 2556 reviews before me, but let me reiterative a few of the highlights. The "dirty sauce" is what ties the sandwiches together, and what sets them apart from the Subways of the world. The "dutch crunch" bread is delicious; I'm not sure what kind of addictive substance they douse it in but it sure is tasty. And just to round out my 3 for 3 hit rate of Yelp's "review highlights" for Ike's, I ordered the "Name of Girl I'm Dating" which is what inspired me to write this fawning review.The only downside: there's no seating at all, and they are strict about occupying space near the store front out of consideration for their neighbors. Since it's essential to eat the sandwich while it's still piping hot, there aren't a lot of great options. I found an uncomfortable curb to plop down on and inhale my sandwich; next time I might try to make it all the way to Duboce or Dolores Park. Hopefully I'll have a bite or two left by the time I get there.
After hearing people rave about this place for years, I decided to finally check it out. I came at the perfect time, cause 30 seconds after I got here the line was going out the door. I got a turkey bacon pepper-jack sandwich. It was amazing. The dutch crunch was perfectly toasty, the turkey was fresh and all other ingredients complimented the sandwich perfectly. Another reason this place is amazing is because they have Dad's Root Beer. The sandwich comes with chips too. For 12 bucks I was full and also amazed. Ike's is tied with Lou's Cafe for being the best sandwich shop in the Bay Area. Definitely plan on coming here more often.
"Hey San Franciscans!" It's right here. The sandwich that will ruin every other sandwich in the world for you.After a frustrating morning, we made our way up to Ike's and while there was a line I was determined to finally uncover the overwhelming mystique that is Ike's.With a solid menu that covers the spectrum of possible toppings with charming names, the hit is in the delivery. Yes, other shops may have the same pieces in their sandwich, but Ike's is playing on a completely different field.I had the the #9, "The Name of the Girl I'm Dating", Chicken Breast, Honey Mustard, Avocado, PepperJack on toasted sour dough and it slapped me back into reality. Hard.In no way do they skimp you on items, and this sandwich fully loaded will give you a gut bomb that will leave you asking for another.Everyone in the shop gives you a smile, and serve you with a modest confidence. They know the sandwich they're delivering, and they should be damn proud.While it's no secret that Ike's is a great sandwich place, I finally had my first experience there, and I have no doubt that I'll be wearing down the pavement out front as I wait for my next trip to sandwich bliss.** OH I forgot to mention: Watch Ike and Co. take on Adam Richman of the Travel Channel's Man v. Food. The episode will premiere this Wed, Aug 26. **
Can you say AMAZING!? It has wonderful sandwiches for everyone! Vegan, vegetarians and meat lovers can all enjoy a GREAT sandwich here! :)THE BEST!
After 1,600 reviews... i'm not sure what else I can add except.+ their sandwiches are awesome. Especially with toasted dutch crunch bread+ the sandwiches seem to take a while to make.. it took ours about 15-20 mins+ we were the second person there when it opened and it took 15-20 mins to get our food so if theres a long line.. oh man.. I have no idea how long you will wait.The sandwiches and pretty packed with ingredients. They don't suffer from the problem from liquids leaking into the bread and making it soggy. Bread/meat balance is nice, and the filling was warm (I had a menage a trois - EDIT - THE SANDWICH for those dirty minded people lol). My friend had a simple peanut butter and jelly sandwich and even that was good. Pretty amazing to me.
Pretty decent sandwiches!!!Tried the Krypto(nite), Doomsday, Paul Ruben and the Eli Manning...35 minutes wait and $55 and change poorer. =)
Super friendly workers here. There is no place to sit and eat your sandwich, and there are signs prohibiting sitting on a nearby curb or anywhere but maybe the nearest park. Couldn't find a full menu anywhere, but they have a large chalkboard on the wall with some of their more popular choices. But the cashier was quick to make suggestions based on what I was wanting and they were spot-on and delicious!!!! I got a Guess who's coming for Thanksgiving, which involves turkey, havarti, sweet cranberry sauce!, I assume dirty (spicy) sauce, lettuce, tomato. It was really, really, really good. Got it on dutch crunch, which could only make it even better. Got hubby a Tony Soprano (italian), and it was also very tasty. No dirty sauce, more like an Italian dressing, but it was also really good. Sandwiches come with choice of 4 chips, which are Dirty's from Gramercy, LA, and reminded us of the more popular Zapp's chips. I have since perused their website menu and am excited to try some other choices next time I'm in town! These really are gourmet and well worth it! For drinks, they have plenty odd soda choices in bottles and cans. Very cool.Stopped in mid-afternoon and it was great, not too long of a line.
Ike's Place: New location, same old sandwich with a few exceptions.I remember the Ike's of yesteryear when there were still tables out in front of the shop and the neighbors weren't at Ike's throat over the noise levels or the smell of the Dirty Sauce. Those were some great days filled with even greater sandwiches. Classics like the Matt Cain and the gut-busting Kryptonite always hit the spot. The bread was nice and soft, perfect for soaking up the Dirty Sauce and all the other juices that invariably came with the sandwich. The meats were tender and the ratio of meat:bread was awesome. I never complained about too little meat or too much bread.Nowadays, however, Ike's has lost some of that awesomeness. Stopping in for lunch this past weekend at the new location was really foreign. The hole-in-the-wall feel was gone and the sandwiches just weren't the same anymore. Don't get me wrong; these sandwiches are still amazing with their delectable breads like the Dutch Crunch with the ever-so-famous Dirty Sauce slathered all over them without regard for your heart's health. However, these sandwiches seemed to be all about the sauce and bread now. The meat has almost disappeared! Having ordered a Paul Reuben, I thought I would at least get a nice helping of pastrami. After all, it was a Reuben. Imagine my surprise when the layer of pastrami was as thick as my pinky finger and the layer of slaw was just as thick. Hell, one layer of bread was thicker than the stuff in the sandwich. I don't know what happened to the portion sizes here, but it was rather disappointing. The only consolation was the fact that everything still tasted amazing. I can't complain about the flavor, but the drop in portions and the seeming increase in price was a little disappointing.
THE FOOD=========================REALLY???Lots of my trusted yelp compadres have rated this place 4/5 stars.REALLY???Adam Richman from Travel Channel came by and all of a sudden..people are intrigued.REALLY???People rave about the "freshness", and "portions" and how flavorful it is.And was it like all the hype said??Er.....NOT really...My wife and I got here at 2pm this Labor Day. We finally got our sandwiches at 3:40..after waiting in line to order for 45 minutes..and then waiting another 40-45 minutes to receive the order.We're not phased by waits that much. It's not a big deal. We're not the kind of folks who get upset when we're at a restaurant and our water glasses aren't refilled and topped off every time we sip them.  We're not THOSE PEOPLE...We can wait and that's not a big deal.  We've waited in long lines at all kinds of places (especially when in NYC).So then...what was the problem???The sandwiches were just MEH....just OKAY.They are not BAD mind you..I won't say that.But, they weren't this world beating life changer either.We ordered three different sandwiches to sample.The "not tonight, honey you got a headache" barbecue halal chicken w/gouda on french roll, the "say hey" pastrami on sour....and then the "superman"..all kinds of meats in dutch crunch.First of all..the "PORTIONS" were not that gigantic.I think people really overstate this part.  The way Ikes cuts out the bread, and the way the sauces sog up the sandwich..makes the sandwich end up not that big.  Flavorwise, we actually preferred the SUPERMAN above the others. It was good by default and not by achievement, because w/that many types of meat..it can't possibly be flavorless. And again..the SUPERMAN was not SUPER BIG.The "sey hey" and the "not tonight" were just plain....bland.They didnt' kick as we thought they would. We even had them all w/the dirty sauce and jalapenos and it still didn't hit. We could barely taste anything DIRTY...THE PEOPLE YOU WAIT WITH================================OMG...this is actually the fun part.Lots of travel channel show watchers for sure..who were lined up to a)see what all the fuss was about...and b) just be seen.No one wanted to be seen more than this over the top hip hop filipino couple in front of us toting as much louis vuitton and gucci logo'd paraphernalia as possible.  The guy had a louis vuitton damier coin purse attached to his belt. REALLY????Behind us was this white couple who loves to golf and also came to see what the hubub was about. They were also enjoying the "people watching".Is it a requirement to wear New Balance shoes in line? Or was I just so bored in that hour and a half to notice people's feet? Almost everyone was wearing new balance shoes. We all got SO bored that everyone started complimenting each other on their "new balances".We also ran into some young school teachers who were nice and thought I went to school w/them (which I took as a compliment)..So in short...you wait SO LONG that the people you line up with..end up like family after it's all said and done(The logo'd couple would be the distant cousins from your dad's side that you are all ashamed of). It's THAT long of a wait. You even decide to eat with them at a table!!!SO...Is is worth waiting over an hour and a half in the sun, getting to know complete strangers to the point that you are almost family, to get mediocre soggy sandwiches that costs 30% more than sandwiches just as good at other places and drive you to the point of insanity to where you end up writing this run on sentence? (the sandwiches were between 7-12 dollars and are not that big...WHAT?)NO they are NOT WORTH IT.IT's a ONE TIME DEAL...ONE AND DONE...IN AND OUT...THAT IS IT.Nice to have tried...but WILL NOT be back again.If you guys want a REALLY good deli sandwich...try Little Lucca's Italian Deli in South San Francisco off of El Camino Real(No I'm not employed by them..but I did grow up near there and went to school next to it).Their spicy garlic sauce will run laps around the "dirty sauce" at Ikes Place. They cost SIX DOLLARS and are BIGGER than the SUPERMAN sandwich..and the SUPERMAN is 12 bucks???.REALLY....
It took me an hour to get this sandwich and it was the first time I have ever been to IKE's. I got a little impatient and wondered if this sandwich was worth 1 hour of waiting...it was. I got the Hella Fat Bastard and it had everything i loved! Cheese, bacon, mozzarella sticks, peppers, and ham...all wrapped in a soft, yet crunchy dutch crunch. We eventually ate the sandwich a half an hour later (finding a place to eat) and you would think the sandwich would get soggy and the bread would collapse (like most sandwiches), but it didn't. Everything was intact and the Dirty Sauce is sooo good. Hella Fat Bastard is my favoriteM.I.L.F is very unique. It is chicken and has a lot of different spices on it. Mario: Very Italian. If you are craving meatballs, this is the one. I want to go back soooo bad, but unfortunately, i don't live around Castro :( sadness.
Best sandwich shop in the entire city (maybe even CA). This is as good as it gets folks. The dirty sauce is to die for. While the actual establishment may be a bit on the tiny side, there's plenty of seating at Dolores park, so head on over there after you grab your lunch. The service is top notch, as you're always greeted with a smile. I'm sure they'd hug ya, but they're stuck behind the counter in that hot cramped kitchen.
As if this place needs another review. I think this is more of a statement for me (That's right, I've had Ike's!) than it is for Ike's. Oh well, I still can't help but rattle on about how AMAZING it is.Been here quite a few times now, and never been disappointed. Kryptonite, Change, Manage-a-trois (Don't you love how they name their sandwiches?), Eli Manning, Hollywood's SF Cheesesteak... Dutch crunch & dirty sauce. Mmm. I took my family here today, and even my mom--who abstrusely throws out the bread in sandwiches--loved it AND finished it.I will say, however, that I'm not fond of this new location. Feels like waiting time is longer, and they won't even pick up the phone. Not to mention all the booming noise and dancing on the windows Saturday afternoons, though I will admit that watching drunk people gets my mind off the wait. BUT when you consider the quality of the food, you have to forgive 'em. Come on, it's just too good.
$30 for two sandwiches. Think I'm going back to this place just because they have this "dirty" sauce they use? Or that they bake your bread to order, hence the long ass wait outside? Oh, how about the fact that your sandwich may start at $9 but can eventually lead up to $15 when you add stuff onto it, leading to an order for two people costing just as much as a sit down diner?HELL FUCKING YEAH THIS PLACE IS WORTH IT!! Salivate fools because until you've had Ike's, any other sandwich you've eaten and plan to eat in the near future doesn't compare to their grandness at Ike's Place. It's like comparing a newborn baby to the ant farm your Auntie Rose gave you on your 35th birthday - no freaking comparison!!Seriously, the price of the food is worth every penny. I thought I was only going to get a $10 sandwich, but as I saw what I could add onto it, I said "Screw the price, I want it" and ended up adding nearly every add-on they had, resulting in a $14 dish without the drink. I honestly scarfed that sucker down the minute I got back to my car.One day I'll try one of their Superman dishes, maybe when $50 doesn't seem like a big deal anymore, lol!Enjoy their sandwiches, you'll find them to be one of the best you'll every have.oh btw, as fun as it may seem to wait out in line during their rush, which sometimes is fun, it's better to just phone in your order and pick up when it's available. call in at least 30 min ahead of time to build up that appetite, and to give them some time to make your food =D
I love it when sexy people make my food.I love it when sexy people make my food even sexier with dirty sauce.I don't like not being able to see every sandwich selection in front of my face, but I will live because all the sandwiches are amazing. (What kind of amazingness am I missing out on, I wonder...) I don't like waiting in lines outside. But, oh daddy, I do love it when you give it to me dirty...Give me a messy bbq chicken sandwich with sauce every where and spicy jalepenos and make it EXTRA dirty!!
Ike's is one of the best sandwich places I have ever been to, hands down. You MUST try their "dirty sauce", it adds to the experience. They offer a wide variety to suit whatever your heart desires. My personal favorite is: "Name of the girl I'm dating". I love how all the flavors come together with every bite. Every bit is just like your biting into the sandwich for the first time. I highly recommend calling in your order. Depending on the location there is usually a long wait. You can anticipate 45mins-1hour+.
Had to convince my dinner companion that we were indeed getting sandwiches instead of a handy in a club bathroom. The location is some kind of cluster**** between a club and a kitchen but the sandwiches are remarkable. "Going home for Thanksgiving" was "ridikaluss" good and ended any of the earlier complaints about the club locale. The meatball sandwich hit it out of the park. Don't forget to ask the cashier about how the struggle for the new location is going and enjoy your sandwich.
I am a sandwich guy. If I could eat one for lunch every day I would. Hell if I could eat them every night for dinner I would. So for me Ike's is like Mecca. I was highly suspect about the other overly positive yelp reviews as I have found SF to not be the best places for hearty, finger dripping, calorie packed sandwiches. HOWEVER I was not disappointed by Ike's. My sandwich was packed with the best balance of produce, sauce and chicken. I washed the work of art down with a fantastic root beer and almost went into a happy food coma. Thing to know about Ike's:- the line sucks- there is no place to sit so everything is to go. But the sandwich are AMAZING!!!!!!!
Words cannot express how much I love this place!!! I have to eat gluten free, and this place is hands down the BEST place I have found yet to get a gluten free sandwich!! The best thing is to call in your order though, because 45 min is pretty standard (totally worth the wait though!) If you want a specialty sandwich (such as gluten free) make sure to call ahead to ensure they have what you want. I've been there before when they've run out of things too (like steak, or a certain kind of cheese). They're a small spot, and the demand is really high, so you can't blame them for running out of supplies, but you wouldn't want to get all the way there to find out they don't have what you want. The first time I went, I was very pleased to have Ike himself come up to me and tell me to make sure to remember that their ranch dressing contains gluten, so if I ever want one of their sandwiches that normally comes with ranch, order a substitute. That may not seem like a big deal, but it's huge in the allergy world :) And their sandwiches last me two meals they're so big (also a huge treat--gluten free bread is quite small in comparison to "normal" bread; Ike realized this so he gives you not one, but TWO sandwiches on gluten free bread. And, he doesn't charge a penny more for it!!) Another thing I love about this place, the workers. They are always in such a great mood. It's clear that they are treated well. Last time I was there, I gave them my name for my pick-up, and they broke into song singing Elvis Costello's "Allison" Totally made my day (well, that and the amazing sandwich) :)
I Freaking LOVE this place! I've only tried a few, but my must haves:-Purple B-Free Tibet-Keith Elvis-Sometimes a VegetarianIve only been a vegetarian for 6months, i get everything veg n i f'n love it. The boys there are awesome! once one of them asked me if i cooked n i thought he askd me to clown on me for being there so often but he gave me some free veg meat to cook with at home! WOO!
The line looks long, but its worth it. Good people know their stuff. It was our last day visiting San Francisco over the weekend, and before our flight back to LAX, we decided to grab a quick one.There were four of us, and we all decided to each order a sandwich and have the good folks at Ike's cut them into 4 pieces so we can all taste everyone else's sandwich. We even got a 5th sandwich for our "JUST IN CASE CLAUSE" - and i'm glad we did.We went 5 for 5, and I dont know if you know anything about odds or whatever, but 5 for 5 is PERFECT, a 100% shot; all the sandwiches were on point. I'll definitely go back just for another...We had: King Koopa, Backstabber, Name of the Girl i'm dating, 16th and market, and Pride of Castro.Can't wait to go back.
A sandwich is just a sandwich, right? Not if you go to Ike's!! With over a hundred of choices for the meat lovers and vegetarians alike, everyone is bound to find a sandwich that's just right for their palates. Just be prepared to stand in line.People weren't kidding about the long line here. However, we were fortunate to meet a friendly couple ahead of us who were just excited to see the place Adam Richman stopped by to have a bite of the Kryptonite during his trip to SF for a Man vs. Food episode. Being in line with people who enjoy watching food shows as much as the bf and I do made the hour-wait (starting from getting in line to getting your hand-delivered sandwich) a bit more do-able. Although their menu "book" was being passed around in the line, I perused the menu online. I thought I was giving myself a head start. But I wasn't smart enough to figure out that you can phone in your order and just pick it up without waiting in line. Oh well. Once I finally stepped foot in this 4x4 of a shop, I was quietly going back and forth in my head about what kind of sandwich I wanted. The smell of garlic, deli meats and freshly toasted bread was messing with my mind! Seriously! So many deliciously sounding choices, how can anybody pick one? But I managed to stick with my original choice of the SF Giants - turkey, bacon, avocado, mushrooms and swiss cheese on dutch crunch roll (doesn't that just make your mouth water already?) while the bf ordered the Paul Reuben - corned beef, homemade coleslaw, french dressing and swiss on dutch, and a side of jalapeno poppers. After ordering, everyone steps out of the shop to wait for their sandwiches, so we followed (not to mention the fact that this place is barely big enough for the employees themselves). Before we knew it Ike himself came out and called my name. He hand-delivered our sandwiches (and complimentary lollipops) to us, making the comment that the Paul Reuben was one of his favorites. Well heck, if it's Ike's favorite, we are definitely in for a treat!We briskly walked back to the car, got in, unwrapped our sandwiches and took a bite. Holy mackerel!! Somehow I could taste every flavor in that sandwich in one bite. Scrumpdidally-umptious! The SF Giants is a classic combo of ingredients (minus the mushrooms) but Ike's has turned the flavor way up with that dirty sauce! The Paul Reuben was a bit messy because of the dressing, but it was just as good as mine. And to think, we have been depriving ourselves all this time...Thanks, Ike, for being the creative genius behind these awesome sandwiches and for establishing yourself in SF!
Since the lines started going around the bend, it was official: This place is the real deal for a bomb sandwich. The menu is pretty F'n funny and so is Ike. Glad to see this guy doing his thang!...Sup wid it Ike? got the "Dirty Dee" on the menu yet?...lol! Come early and call it in as the lines get long.
Everybody and their mama has been raving about Ike's place, and yes it's worth the hype. I went here one weekend to see what the deal was.I got there around 12:30, and the line was already 3 houses long. After about 45 minutes, it was almost my turn to place my order and I've just received a binder full of sandwiches from the person in front of me, but what's this? The menu featured over 200 varieties of sandwiches! I was pretty overwhelmed with the array of choices, but I ended up choosing the "Cowboy Curtis" which consists of sliced corned beef, home made poppy seed coleslaw, BBQ, smoked gouda on a freshly baked dutch crunch roll slathered in dirty sauce.It took another 20 minutes to actually get the sandwich, but it was completely worth it in the end. The sandwich was rich, spicy and wonderfully garlicky. Dutch crunch rolls usually tear up the roof of my mouth, but this one was soft and chewy. Ike's famous "dirty sauce," which is their secret house garlic sauce, is even baked into the bread in case the sandwich didn't have enough flavor.One of Ike's famous sandwiches is called Doomsday. This $16 sandwich consists of roast beef, corned beef, pastrami, salami, turkey, bacon, ham, mozzarella sticks, stuffed jalapeno poppers and avocado. I give props to anyone to can finish this sandwich. I could barely eat half of the Cowboy Curtis in one sitting!For those of you who work in the peninsula, Ike's opened another storefront in the hallway of an office building. You'll find Ike's at 555 Twin Dolphin Drive, Redwood City, CA.
good food
The Kryptonite is like the biggest and yummiest sandwich I have ever had! Meat eaters have to get this sandwich. I felt like I was going to have a heart attack after finishing a quarter of it, but it was worth it because the Kryptonite was so good. You can't go wrong with Dutch Crunch bread and some dirty sauce. Totally worth waiting 45 minutes for such a delicious sandwich! I'm definitely going back!
This place doesn't need much hype cuz IT'S THE BEST DAMN SANDWICH PLACE I'VE EVER BEEN TO!!So instead of reviewing it for its awesomeness, here are a few tips instead:1. Get the Dutch Crunch Bread (I don't really know what it is, but its delicious!)2. Ask for extra dirty sauce (ridonculous!!!)3. Make sure to either bring a drink or get a drink cuz you're gonna need one for these hefty beasts4. Have a roll of napkins with you when you eat cuz it gets quite messy5. Don't be disappointed if you can't finish the whole sandwich in one sitting, cuz its still freakin gaaad damn good a few hours later6. Don't ruin this sandwich for yourself and eat it while inebriated in any way, you're gonna want to savor every single bitWell, I hope these tips were helpful, enjoy!
Love this place!!!!!!!
I almost didn't stop by because of the long waits but since it was on the way home, why not? Surprisingly, there was absolutely no wait! 10:30am on Sunday ~ score! I had the Menage a Trois (halal chicken, honey, honey mustard, smoked Gouda, bbq sauce) and it was delicious. The ingredients complimented eachother very well. The sandwich was a bit messy but it's all part of the charm of Ike's. Come here and then take your sandwiches to nearby Dolores Park for a lovely picnic ~
I like Ikes. I don't know if I like it enough to stand in a line for 2 hours... but I like it enough to call in ahead and then stand in a line for half an hour. That is ok. Got the M.I.L.F and the Change last night and they were both good. The Change was a little heavier cause of the BBQ sauce. Also, we caught them during "happy hour" which meant a free drink and chips with our sandwich purchase. sweeet. I'm glad I got to experience it before they close up shop at this location and move on. It's kind of like a rite of passage... a bond now shared between me and all the crazies who will continue to find places to wait eons for food. Gotta love SF.
The hype about this place is just hype. And like Chuck D told us all those years ago, don't believe the hype.Food-wise, it's nothing special. It's completely Californian, though, so if you're from anywhere close to Philly, Jersey, or NYC and you order a Tony Soprano, don't expect the kind of sandwich you'd find in the Italian section of town. But the meat's tasty, the bread's ok, and the topping are fine, if not better than that.I do wish they'd honored my request for no mayonnaise, though. See, I know Californians _have_ to put mayo on every sandwich by default, but most places are pretty good at holding off on it if you specifically ask. It's not a taste issue, but a digestive one, so for those freaks like me, watch yourself with this place.Of course, there's some awesomeness about this place. I love how one of the options is a "vegan womanizer" and that they carry Jolt Cola. The inner going-to-all-ages-hxc-shows and 12-year-old respectively in me were going nuts when I saw that.I'm not sure if this place is worth $10 a sandwich, but I'll keep the option up my sleeve for the right time, and, hopefully, next time they'll hold the mayo.
DAMN this is something beyond a sandwich....they be right "this ain't your momma's sandwich shop," oh no this is MUCH MUCH More. As in MORE stuffings or ANYTHING for that matter, including mozzarella sticks and onion rings!!! Ooooo I just love the feeling of that oily grease clogging my arteries while my taste buds are in ecstasy.I got the Nacho Boy : Roast Beef, mushroom, avocado, swiss. Which of course includes the special sauce which is drippingly good! The sandwich is beyond satisfying. AND comes with some tasty chips (which they have recommendations on) and a drink (some fineeeee soda's including LENINADE). What makes this place is Ike and his crew who are helpful, knowledgeable, and plain fun!! Its the service that makes the nearly hour wait in line seem a little more worth it.It really is a San Francisco treat, so if you haven't tried it......GO and GET IN LINE. Btw bring a friend to kill the time with in line!
Ok... so I went here with my brother and had never heard of this place in my life. Now I am not much of a condiment lover. I hate ketchup, mustard, and mayo. I often feel it covers the flavors of the ingredients. I know it is weird and hard to trust, but just hear me out. I ordered my sandwich with "no sauce", having no idea what "dirty sauce" was, assuming that it was like other special sauces (1000 island and what have you). Well, I must have committed the ultimate sin because they could not have been more rude to me after that. Instead of informing me what dirty sauce was... they were just total dicks. When I realized what I did, I asked for a side of the sauce, still having no idea what it was and they totally snubbed me. Finally the guy making the sandwiches (Ike?) came out and very nicely explained to me that their special sauce was toasted on the bread or whatever and it is not like a 1000 island or any other "special" sauce. I then explained that I am not a condiment lover and I had no idea what I was ordering and I didn't mean to be disrespectful by saying "no sauce". jeez.. I just wanted a blt.... I didn't think I would end my order by appologizing to the chef.All in all--- the sandwich was ok with or without dirty sauce... but I felt like I was at the Sandwich Nazi. A full reading of yelp reviews should not be mandatory prior to eating at a new restaurant. I left pretty upset and it will take a long time for me to give this place another chance, if ever.
Good: Unexpected ingredients somehow find harmony in these sandwiches. Not too big, not unnecessarily fatty, not overwhelming. Everything was just right. Thumbs up for the dirrrty sauce.Bad: The wait. But it's part of the experience, I guess.Bottomline: Best sandwich I've ever had. I'm a small girl and I killed the entire thing. I beat out my boyfriend. He couldn't believe it. Believe the hype. Ike's Place and it's harmonious blend of dirty sauce, pastrami, fresh bread, mozzarella sticks and more just made this one deeply satisfying meal. This place isn't all about "Let's see how much fattening food we could stuff into a sandwich so people can go "Whaaat?? They put that in there?! That's crrrraaazzy!!" These sandwiches actually taste good. The different flavors and textures balance each other out. I was thoroughly impressed. I crave it all the time, and that's not easy to do.
This place is ridiculously good. Well worth the wait. There is a reason why the line is always out the door and around the corner; they have the dankest sandwiches in town.
Ike. Whoever you are, you make damn good sandwiches.At first, I was discouraged by the long line, but the line moved efficiently and surprisingly fast. My one suggestion would be for them to have some printouts of the menu so that people don't feel rushed in deciding what they want. A list of bread options would also be nice.Logistics aside, the sandwiches here are good for three reasons. First, all the ingredients taste fresh. Second, the sauce they use is amazing. They have something called "dirty sauce," which I'm pretty sure is made from garlic-pesto fairy dust. Third, the bread. When I pray to God and recite, "give us this day, our daily bread," I will now envision the breads I ate at Ike's. To elaborate, here's what I got.I got two sandwiches at Ike's. First was the Nacho Boy on a Toasted Garlic French Roll. The Nacho Boy is filled with great-tasting roast beef, mushrooms, avocados, and Swiss cheese. Sounds amazing, right? Well, it is. The buttery, garlicky, crispy French roll only added to the hurricane of flavors in my mouth. Good stuff.Second was the Yelp-recommended (thanks!) Name of Girl I'm Dating on a Dutch Crunch Roll. This one wins. Not that it's a competition, but it does. This sandwich has Halal chicken breast, honey mustard, avocado, and pepper jack cheese. Again, amazing ingredients and a great combination of flavors. The best part about this sandwich was that the chicken breast was actually shredded, which not only made eating the sandwich easier, but also prevented the chicken breast from tasting too dry. The Dutch roll adds the right amount of crispiness to the sandwich and falls off with ease with every bite.Every sandwich includes the famed "dirty sauce," lettuce, tomato, red onions, pickles, and banana peppers, so if you want to lay off on a few ingredients, just let them know.My only caveat is that these sandwiches aren't for the delicate palate. They're really filling and tackle you with a football team of flavors, so be prepared, and maybe consider sharing one sandwich between two people. If half a sandwich isn't enough for you, then be civil and at least warn your friend before you tackle him/her for his/her sandwich.GET: Name of Girl I'm Dating on a Dutch Crunch Roll
great veggie sandwiches! unique hybrid of flavors! :) love their chips...mmmmm!
Need a sleep aid?Ike's Sandwich might just be the right prescription for you. Called in an order for pick up to avoid the 1.5 hour wait - strongly advised. Ordered the Menage a Trois as sugested by the 7x7 Top 100 list, which came accompanied by a bag of chips and a carmel apple pop. Was starved, was able to fit 1/2 of the sandwich into my stomach, and despite that took bites of the other half because it was just THAT good - sweet, and meaty, filled with I don't even know - lol. Within minutes I was food coma'd - and we passed out on the couch for at least an hour. Then I woke up and was like WTH just happened, the sandwich knocked us out - it was an interesting but satisfying feeling.Side effects: Food bloat, messy hands and table, can't be saved for later (bread will get soggy), and garlic breath for days.
Ike's, you never disappoint me. I was back visiting in SF, and therefore I was back at Ike's. =)I thought the Al Bundy was amazing, then I had the Tony Soprano, and I couldn't decide which I loved more. Then, Lex Luther came along, and it became a three way tie...
can't wait to eat that dirty sauce
Yet again, Ike's Place FTW! Last time, I had the Jeries' Big Meat Sandwich and I could only finish half of it. (That's saying a lot since I'm a bottomless pit when it comes to food.)Last night, I wanted something a little more managable so I ordered the Jim Rome. I've always had a crush on this ESPN sports-talk host so I figured his namesake sandwich would be equally as delicious! And, it was!!! Ike's Red Pesto sauce mixed with the smooshed avocado to keep Mr. Rome very moist and tasty.  (Did I ruin your appetite yet?!)
Is it sad that sandwiches are my favorite food? This place lives up to all of the hype. It's so fab. I had the Vegetarian pilgrim, yummy!
Awesome sandwiches!!! My boyfriend and I wanted to try this place after the buzz on Man vs. Food. I truely understand what all the fusses are all about now. Its worth the $30 for 2 sandwiches, and 2 soda... get the 2 free bags of chips.... I will be here again next time we are in the city
I shepherded my friends to Ike's last week because they had yet to experience the phenomenon. I don't know what it is, but there's something that just compels me to share the goodness of Ike's with everyone. It's like I've seen the light.Even at 2pm on a Friday, the line was about 20 deep. I briefly considered calling in the order as we waited in back, but it was a beautiful day, and all good things come to those who wait, so we spent our time debating what to get.It was a weekday, so this time I absolutely had to get fries. And since I'd been making good progress through the menu via Redwood City, I went with a repeat this time and ordered a nacho boy supreme again. I also splurged on Dirty chips (mmm salt & vinegar) and a ginger soda (so so snazzy). And we were lucky enough to get the table!! Har har, the zen paid off.Fries came first, which we all promptly devoured while dunking in dirty sauce. Some crunchy, some soft, not at all oily, and oh so delicious. Sandwiches came next. There were a few remarks of "oh this is the best sandwich ever" and "my god this is good" along with "everything is toasted, so awesome", but generally it was pretty quiet because we were too busy scarfing them down.We came 4 hungry people. We left 4 happy and enlightened souls.
ok so i've heard A LOT about this place. came here once before to stand in line for 10min before deciding to go to tangerine since it was raining and there was no where to eat. so fast forward to a sunny afternoon in februrary. we decide to take the step and wait in line for the famous sandwiches. we ended up waiting in line for about an hour and then another 30 minutes after we ordered for the food...... yes, the sandwiches were GOOOODDDD. but the wait?! ridiculous!!!! i dont think its worth the wait... i ordered the: - Nacho Boy (Hot Roast Beef, Mushrooms, Avocado, Swiss w/ Dirty Sauce, Lettuce, Tomato, no Mayo) - prob my fave. the roast beef with mushrooms in dirty sauce? ummmm anddd avocado. great mix. - Eli Manning (Halal Chicken Breast, Zesty Garlic and Herb Sauce, Mushrooms, Avocado, Cheddar) - very tasty chicken, also another popular sandwich- Papa Sam (Wild Salmon Burger, Dirty Sauce, Cheese) - umm no. its better to stick with the meats. the seafood was not that great... not only are their sandwiches good but they have some good drinks too. they carry empire drinks. their coke, orange soda, and root beer is great. definitely recommended.i also have to put in a good word about their service. we had the cutest girl put in our order. she was super friendly and nice. she was also VERY helpful. although in line, youre thinking UGH why cant those people ordering make up their minds!? but when its actually you, you want that undivided attention and she gives it to you. she tells you all the options and even suggest some sandwiches that you might like better. shes great!! ikes wonderful too however i didnt have much interaction with him. although it is nice that he still works there and brings out the food to each customer. TIP THAT WILL SAVE YOU AN HOUR IN LINE: call in your order... you might only have to wait 10-30min!!! even if youre in line, you might as well call in your order b/c it will seriously be faster. it makes the people in line jealous (like me) but you're the smarter one for doing so... and your stomach will stop growling and be happy with you..
ummmm no... sorry i was not impressed. Saw all the reviews on Yelp and decided to check it out. Was not the worth the trip from Daly City. Called in order around 4:30 and they said they would be ready around 6:15. No problem, for a wait like that it has to be good right? The sandwiches were mediocre at best. Bland and pretty small. Ended up spending $30 on 3 sandwiches, not worth it. I was really excited to taste the dirty sauce but to my dismay there seemed to be none on all the sandwiches. Not a great first impression. My advice, go to Little Lucca in S San Francisco. Their sandwiches are always on point.
Visited San Fran about 4 months ago and I remember going to "the best sammich shop in the world". We phoned in our order and made a trip down to Ike's Place. We placed the order about 30 min on the phone and waited another 30 min at the store. The wait was pissing me off and I was getting cranky.I admit it was a pretty good sandwich and quality of the ingredients were top notch, however I thought to myself that the sandwich was only so damn good cause they make you wait so damn long and anything tastes really good when you are really hungry. Well here we are 4 months later and I am craving that sandwich I had there. I've been eating at more sandwich shops near Los Angeles to get the same goodness at ike's but still nothing is close.Recommendation: If you're in frisco, go to ike's. Whether you are hungry at the time or not, it will be worth the wait. mmmm im hungry right now....
Had to give this place a try before leaving Frisco and after seeing all the good reviews and I'm a sandwich person. Ordered the kryptonite and that thing was huge, I thought they made a mistake and gave me a extra sandwich, they packed it in two. The meat was fresh and there was a lot of flavor, I didn't taste anything special with the sauce and the dutch crunch bread, after a while the sandwich gets soggy, but i finished everything, I did want more sauce to it though. My son got the Barry b, he enjoyed the meat not so much of the bread. My lady got the veggie Tom Brady and she enjoyed the chicken veggie patty the mozzarella sticks n most things inside, I wasn't to high on the mozzarella sticks, tasted microwaved to me. Spent almost $50 on three sandwich, pricey but had to give the place a try, ordered my sandwich through the phone which saved me time and the people were nice and got my sandwich on time when I came to pick it up. The prices for the sandwich I recommend they include a drink as well as the chips and lollipop. I see all the hype this place gets and I'm not to high on it, when I come back I'd like to give it a try again. I see the effort they put into making these sandwiches and they helped me out through the phone, made the pick up easy for me, only downside I think they should add a menu in the store, prices are a little high and make it a combo with the drinks and chips for those prices there charging.
I got the Pilgrim, which I found a bit too sweet and smokier than I'd like. The bread was on point though.
besssst sandwich i've ever had. Lizzy's Lips are the best!
It's kinda stupid for me to review Ike's because it's obvious that this whole dang city already knows. 550 reviews? Yah, this one is just another teardrop in the ocean. I'm so glad for Ike's sake that this little gem has taken off, though I'm bummed for my own sake. To say the secret is out would be an understatement. The sandwiches at Ike's are a little slice of heaven and remind me that it's good to at the top of the food chain. Woo Hoo!
Well Ike's moved again and I gotta say, it's the best location yet for them. Stark contrast to the last time they were on 16th...you can actually walk inside the building!You might have to wait a bit if you don't call it in but epic sandwich is epic
**I am strictly gluten-free, so my review is from the perspective of someone with this need.**After reading an article in today's Chronicle about SF gluten-free restaurants, I ventured into Ike's for the first time to try a sandwich with their GF breadPROS: A GF sandwich!! Actually, as others have noted, you get two sandwiches because the bread they used is slices from a typical loaf of what appears to be rice bread. I was told their "dirty sauce" is GF, which was a relief. CONS: Not the best GF bread out there; they would be better off buying rolls from Mariposa. Since they are offering GF bread, it would be helpful if they listed which sandwiches contain GF ingredients.Minus one star because Lime is so freaking irritating.
I read on here that Ike's will give you a free sandwich on your birthday and it's TRUE! I came here back in May on my birthday with some co-workers during lunch. None of them had heard of Ike's and I swore that it would change their world. We made it before a lunch rush and got 5 different sandwiches. When I ordered mine, I sheepishly asked "is it true that you get a free one on your birthday?" and the extremely friendly woman said "yup! we just need to see your ID" which I was more than happy to present. (This is the same woman who asked for my ID once when using a debit card and insisted that I was Jewish with my name and that we were brethren. And she pointed out that we're both Tauruses and stubborn. Love her.)On my birthday I had the sandwich that was essentially a Hawaiian pizza on a roll. Ham, provolone, pineapple, marinara sauce all on a dutch crunch.I'm just going to say it... possibly the best sandwich of all time.
great sandwhiches
The purple B is amazing. I hope Ike's sleazy neighbors go to sandwich hell. They are awful, gold-digging, evil people. nytimes.com/2010/05/21/uSupport local businesses with owners who actually care and make our community great. . . . and order your sandwich an hour or two before you want it so you don't have to wait in line.
Sorry to do this to you, Ike. Your food is delicious, but when I call in to get a takeout order two days in a row and I'm told that it's going to take TWO HOURS before I can get my sandwiches that is more than a little ridiculous. The first day was Friday at lunchtime. Okay, I understand, you're a little busy. But calling at 2PM on a Saturday and being told I can't get my sandwich until 4PM is just beyond annoying. This has happened to me before, I've just never felt compelled to write until today.I suppose this is a good problem for you to have, so to speak, but I don't care how good your food is if it takes me two hours to get it. I know this is the sort of problem businesses usually shrug their shoulders at - "Eh, I'm too popular, so be it," - but it has the overall effect of making me just think "I really like this place, but I'm never going to even attempt to eat there any more because it's such a pain in the ass."
Yep saw this on the Man vs. Food show..finally got to it. They serve sandwiches of GIGANTIC portions. My wife had the avocado BLT. It was to die for ....bacon thick freshly cooked.... role toasted. I had a superman. You have to be super to carry it. It was heavy and delish pastrami,roast beef, cheese dragged through the garden...You get the idea.."Subway" is a piece of tissue paper compared to this behemoth of a sandwich.So please give this place a try.(They are being evicted because of their success..Trial start June 29,2010) The neighbors are extorting or blackmailing them because of the success. Claim customers are too loud.Neighbors ask for $800,000 cause their peace was disturbs. awww.They just need to have a compromise and not be GREEDY Bastards
My husband and I love this place. I always get "HOT DATE FOR HIRE" if you are jalapeno popper lover you would realy enjoy this sandwish.
The matt cain! The menu is as fun as it is good, enjoy seeing what to eat next. The place can get packed if you're dropping in so calling the order in is more ideal. The staff is friendly and hussles, all I could ask for.
Best sandwiches I've ever had! The ones with the vegan breaded chicken are the best ones; this is like heaven for vegetarians. There is usually a long line during lunch time, but it doesn't take that long to get in and out, they do work really fast, last time I ordered, they arrived with my sandwiches in about 5 minutes. Good customer service too, very friendly people.
The sandwiches are good. Everyone agrees on that BUT....Dude, your place is starting to get the Soup Nazi attitude when it comes to ordering. The call-in orders are waaay longer than walk-up ordering. Isn't that the whole point of calling in?? It works at every other lunch place in the city. Pizza places can handle multiple calls. What's up? Don't let your place get like Pinky's in LA. Stupid long waits that take away from the food satisfaction. (BTW Pinky's sucks)Sorry dude, I'll only be visiting when I can waste 2-3 hours for a $10 sandwich. Maybe get a bigger place, more staff?Anyway, I'm just upset that I can't eat your sangweech every lunch day of the week.
My very first Yelp review and well worth it. Ike's seriously has the best sandwiches in the city. I've gotten the Menage a Trois twice and have loved it both times. There will be a super long line, but what do you expect. It's called supply and demand. If you truly dont have to time to wait in line, order ahead. Your pick up time will be an hour or so later than the time you placed it, but bottom line is you wont be waiting in line for more than 10 minutes. While I understand that ambiance and the dining experience is taken into account in all reviews, be smart people, this place doesnt have tables or chairs for your convenience. Plan ahead. Figure out where you're going to eat to be able to enjoy your sandwich to its fullest potential.
My favorite sandwich place in San Francisco! The sandwiches are tasty, everything on the menu is good, and I love the owner's creativity with the names. I used to get the CA BLT, the name of the girl I'm dating, or menage a trois. All delicious in its own way. Can't wait to go back and check out the new sandwiches next time I'm in town.
I've met my match! There was an epic battle scheduled on Saturday night between me and one of Ike's sandwiches, the "Menage-a-tois". The sandwich WON! My goodness, that sandwich kicked my butt! I thought I was tough. I'd been training and conditioning for months. But nothing could have prepared me for this gargantuan sandwich. Seriously, Ike? Mozzarella sticks and jalapeno poppers on a sandwich, with three different kinds of cheese and two different kinds of meat? Dirty sauce and barbecue sauce? I was determined to finish this sandwich, but it was not easy. I barely made it to the last bite. This place is dangerous, but definitely a must-try! :)
Just because it's worth noting, I called the sandwiches in just before 12PM on a Sunday and got a 2:20PM pick-up time. No big deal, as I wasn't hungry yet and content to chill at home until it was time to get them.We ordered: 1 Mobile Momma (breaded veggie-chicken, hot sauce, ranch, and provolone) on dutch crunch with all but mayo and tomato. 1 Wario (veggie-meatballs, mozzarella sticks, marinara) on wheat with nothin' but dirty sauce and some extra pesto. I had a half of each sandwich and, while I think I have to crown the MM winner, both were delicious. The MM had an amazing balance between buffalo wing-like tastiness and lettuce and pickle coldness/crispness. The bread was really, really excellent. Ditto for the wheat bread that held the Wario together. This sandwich was good, but I had higher hopes for a sandwich stuffed with mozzarella sticks--there could have been some more crispness and juiciness when biting into it. Definitely get the extra pesto. Bottom line: as a vegetarian, where else can I find sandwiches that go beyond the played-out portobello mushroom or hummus and greens? Moreover, where can I find sandwiches this awesome period? Pricey, yes, but this is definitely a treat, and I had no issues with the pick-up system.
Great sandwiches....too bad it was soo bloody cold and the line extented outside on the sidewalkFresh and tasty sandwiches....I like it as much as Little Luccas.I would go again...the BLTA was fab
Great sandwiches that live up to the hype. Just make sure to call your order in to avoid the line.
we came to Ike's oncesandwiches. just. changed. for uswe can't un-eat you
I went back to Ike's again yesterday with a coworker and this time ordered the Paul Reubens sandwich. Without doubt, one of the BEST Reuben sandwiches I've ever had. As we were waiting for our order, the line for sandwiches started getting longer and longer. I then noticed Ike himself coming out to help keep the line moving, taking orders and dealing with adjustments to exisiting orders, all the while popping back in to the kitchen to supervise the folks making the sandwiches. Very cool to see the business owner themselves roll up their sleeves and ensure the customers are taken care of.I then decided to take out my iTouch and see if I could pick up a wifi signal in the area. Guess what?!?! Ike's offers FREE wifi! This place just gets better and better every time I drop by to fill my belly. Staff was extremely friendly, professional, and helpful as usual. No surprise there. I wish I had more stars to give out.
Oh my goodness! I believe there is a sandwich god now!!! This place is like a sandwich heaven!!I decided to try this place over the weekend. The line to order was about 15 minute wait? Well worth it! They only have about 10 chairs for customers to sit outside. 5-10min wait for our sandwiches to come.I ordered the Nacho Girl which is a salmon/mushroom/avocado/swiss sandwich. Very moist, tender and heavenly~I also tried the Sexy Boy which is a shortrib/mozzarella sticks sandwhich. I love mazzarella!! To be honest i liked the Nacho Girl more, but this sandwich was still heavenly~But the secret ingredient for their sandwich to taste so god damn heavenly is their DIRTY SAUCE! Which is a garlic and mixed herb sauce. Makes everything taste more juicier and flavorful!Someone who was in line with me mentioned that all their sandwiches and burgers are good. Just choose whatever you usually like in sandwich (their menu is humongous btw) and the dirty sauce will make it 10 times better!Pricing is good for a taste of heavenly sandwiches.. around $7-$13.
This place should be on a list of places to try before you die. It's quite amazing, every time. The variety and options are also endless, even if you are vegetarian there are amazing sandwiches for you.
I've been here twice and both times the sandwiches were excellent. Ike's is one of those "trendy" places to eat in the city so you'll see all different types of folks there. It amazes me to see how many people find something trendy and love to talk about it. That's probably why it got such good reviews on Yelp. Is anyone paying attention to the return on what your paying for?The reason I give Ike's 3 stars is not for the taste. The taste is great. They are overly expensive and the portions are not big enough for a dude. Maybe for women, since they don't seem to eat as much as us...  I think i paid $9.83 for a chicken sandwich and that's just too much for a deli sandwich that doesn't fill you up.
WILDLY POPULAR SANDWICH SPOTMy friend C came to town and wanted go here because she saw it featured on the television show Man vs. Food. I have passed by here many times but the line was always too long and I just did not want to deal with the hassle.We joined the long line of about fifty people that snaked down the sidewalk. A couple of menus were thrown to the hungry crowd to study. The menu is overwhelming so I suggest previewing it online before you go. You will find creative sandwiches names such as "Not Tonight I Have a Headache" or the intriguing "Doomsday" filled with roast beef, pastrami, corned beef, turkey, ham, bacon, corned beef, mozzarella sticks, avocado, and fried jalapeno poppers!Eli ManningL and I chose number 100, which is called the Eli Manning sandwich, was filled with chicken, dirty sauce, mushrooms, avocado, and cheddar cheese. I decided to add bacon to the sandwich; everything tastes better with bacon. We both thought that the sandwiches really did live up to the hype!Forty!C chose number 40 which is also called "Forty!" It is a chicken fried steak sandwich topped with cheddar cheese. C decided to add the red pesto to the sandwich and had it served on sourdough bread. She let us have a bite of her sandwich and I would seriously order this on my next visit.The owner, Ike, was busy delivering sandwiches and greeting the crowd. It is so nice to see a local business thrive.
I don't get it. Obviously I'm in the minority here.I got some sort of asian chicken sandwich here. I'd rate that a 1.5. My GF got a fake meat sandwich, I forget the exact kind. I'd give that a 3.5. A friend who visited from out of town rated his sandwich as being good but not much better than that.I don't feel as though I'm being an east-coast sandwich elitist on this review. The place is mediocre. Throw in the 60-person deep line that's always outside and it's just not worth the effort. I would like to point out that the people who work there are nothing short of wonderful. So nice, friendly, and chill.
Great sandwiches!
Goddamit it's been a while and this joint deserves all the recognition it's received. You know that question motherfuckers ask you "If stranded on a desert island"??? Yes! It's that fucking good. Now that I'm back in my native L.A., there are few things I miss about SF; The weather, the walking, the retail, certain people (not native to SF) the pub life (it's good in L.A. too jerks, don't be presumptuous) and yes, the vegan sandwich offerings from Ike's.  I even enjoyed the experience prior to re-opening on Sanchez and was at my Sunday hang-out Lime. Hey, fuck-it. It was a good time and a good excuse to stroll the stro'. I was ecstatic to hear Ike is opening in Westwood regardless of my disdain for UCLA and that part of the city altogether, but I get it $$$!!! Not to mention Ike has a great back-story and is engaging online and off, a virtue which will garner him plenty of success in anything he does... Wait, Why am I wasting my time? You bastards know how good it is, just go!
Decor:I expecting a regular sandwich place; instead, I got a club in the daytime. LOL :) This place has pretty cool decor, and the DJ was playing hip-hop music. I went there Saturday afternoon. It has a fun vibe. They have a lounge in the front, and a bar in the middle of the restaurant. Some folks were dancing in the back. The line was out the door.Food:The sandwich was soooo good and juicy. My husband and I both ordered the Manage a Trois. It has Halal Chicken Breast, Real Honey, Honey Mustard, BBQ, PepperJack, Swiss, and Smoked Gouda. We ordered it on Dutch Crunch bread. The cashier suggested that we add bacon to our sandwich and boy was it good. It was kind of heavy and messy, so be careful when you eat it. :)
I'm totally addicted to these sandwidches.
Sizzle the dizzle all up in this hizzle! It's good. I'm a sammich lover, nay an addict. Something about wrapping things in other things prior to eating them just appeals to me.... hence why i'm a fan of the cousin of the sandwich, mr. burrito. but I digresss... a bajillion choices and I still managed to get something not on teh menu... Nacho Boy Supreme, but with swiss instead of Havarti.I won't bore you with review 1,000,006... but it was damn good.Long ass wait for the food though, and if it were any less good, I wouldnt be down to wait 30 minutes for a meal at it's simplist.
heard about this place a bit ago from my friends. Saying its one of the best sandwich shops in the city. I actually believe it is. Why? they dont have the most high end machinery to cut meat, nor do they have a huge amazing oven and they aren't dressed in chef outfits to make sandwiches. There is hype, there are rumors its a fluke. You are terribly wrong if you are able to say its not amazing and unique if you bite into one of their sandwiches. There is usually a line, worth it. There is usually a long wait for your custom sandwich, worth it. They have a very unique menu that will satisfy the weird salty sweet guy or the person that wants a enormous all meat sandwich.I always get the superman. 5 kinds of meat i believe stuffed into a dutch crunch. Extra dirty sauce which is Ike's special pesto sauce and a little bit of sriracha. A drink and a bag of chips for a little over 10 bucks.Worth the wait, worth the money. Definitely does not let down. Its not their fault they have good service, great "different" sandwich's thats causing them to have enormous lines. So stop trying to shut them down!
If the rumors about Ike's shutting down are true I may commit a crime. If it were possible to have sandwich-induced orgasm, i believe i have experienced it. The dirty sauce plus all the other fixin's on these ike sandwiches just make them heaven sent. I love that each sandwich comes with a bag of chips. The Jim Rome is out of this world. Hate the line but its so worth it! Would love them to move to a larger location but i feel like the long line and the view of workers in the back in a way-too-small space kind of adds to the magic of Ikes.
All you need to know before experiencing the fabulous San Francisconess of Ike's is this: Bring a jacket, bring a friend (or a book), and bring your appetite and you'll be one happy sandwich eater. The wait, which WILL happen (don't try to fight it) must be seen as part of the enjoyable charm of this place, because I'm pretty sure the employees know they can take their sweet time and still not get knocked for it. However, Ike's COULD be sped up if they wanted to, but perhaps the care and attention they give to each sandwich wouldn't be as complete without the 10 minute wait for your pieces of bread and a mess of dirty sauce happiness in the middle. Ordered the veggie menage a trois. It's a perfect love triangle between smoky cheese, fake turkey (which tastes awesome, btw) and the sweetest honey-laden bbq sauce I've ever tried...I could really drown my head in that stuff. Yum yum yum. Can't wait to come back to Ike's and make my way down their mile-long menu of sandwiches. And that's all I have to say about that. And all you need to know is that the menage a trois made its way onto the 2010 SF 100 Things you Need to Eat & Drink Before you Die. Even though this sandwich may help you get to that day much faster, you'll definitely be smiling :)
Love the sandwiches!!
I have come here about 3 times and the last time was just this past Sunday and I swear to you...IKES is a different breed of sandwiches! And look at those RAVING reviews down there! I'm usually afraid to try different sandwiches so the I honestly must say that the previous times I have gone here I order my usual deli sandwich which is a turkey avocado. This past Sunday I had the courage to give in and try something different since my friend got the Kryptonite! (Yikes!!) Chase was the one who helped us and he recommended that I try the SF Giants since I wanted to stay in the arena of Turkey Avocado. Wow it was delicious.....turkey, bacon, avocado, mushrooms and swiss cheese on dutch crunch roll. OMG!!! It was heaven at my fingertips and my tastebuds were jumping with joy. Of course I didn't finish it myself, I'd look like a pig so my boyfriend had the other half. I haven't asked my friend about the Kryptonite sandwich but I'm guessing it was just as good as mine.Make sure you are prepared to stand in a long line or wait about 1 hour for a called in order. Definitely worth the wait. I heart you IKEs...I hope you stay in the neighborhood. I'm guessing they never had an IKEs sandwich.....LOL
maybe i like to be contrary to trends. i dunno, but ike's is definitely NOT the best sandwiches that I've ever tasted. and worth the wait?!? uhm, no (and we called in our order - still had a 2 hr wait, AND it took forever to even get through to place the order!). super pricey sandwiches, long wait, nowhere to eat.... the best part was probably the salt&vinegar chips that you can get with your sandwich. husband and i ordered the spiffy tiffy and the sf cheesesteak. my friend LOVED his sandiwiches - matt cain (the best one), and eli manning. the spiffy tiffy was freakin' bland. the pesto was mixed with the chicken, and all of the other ingredients on the top had zero taste. similar to the cheesesteak, but i think the cheesesteak had a little more flavor. we all decided that the chicken options kind of sucked. would i ever go back? no. yes, having mozz sticks and jalapeno poppers in a sandwich sound appealing, but then again, heart attacks are never sexy, and why would i pay $12+ for that?!? not worth it.
Their manage-a-trois is hands down the best sandwich I've ever had. Ever. It has Halal Chicken Breast, Real Honey, Honey Mustard, BBQ, PepperJack, Swiss and Smoked Gouda. We also added bacon, avocado and mozzarella sticks into the sandwich. It sounds crazy but it's damn good and unlike any other sandwich I've ever had.About the price.... My jaw dropped when I found out how much the sandwich was ($19 bucks for 1 sandwich and a drink) but it was worth it once I took a bite. It was soo good that I ordered the same exact sandwich the next day for a road trip back home. Note: The sandwich is ginormous and filling so it can be split between 2-3 people.
How can such a tiny, out-of-the-way, brightly-colored, tasty sandwich shop be so overwhelming? Long lines, lack of breathing room, rapid-fire ordering process, and the most confusing menu this side of stereo instructions doesn't help the process. Oh, and I actually detected myself getting anxious after I ordered and I had no clue what to do next (should I go outside and wait with all the other plebians? Should I stay put? Should I look for somewhere to sit, and, if so, where would that be?) To top it off the tiny woman who took my order gave me attitude for not getting my drink fast enough from the refrigerator.Summary: Ike's sandwiches are very good-- possibly even living up to the lofty hype presented by the internet intelligentsia-- but this is one fo those places I'll only go a few times a year lest my hair fall out after turning gray from the pressure!That said, I love the line from the new Star Trek by Scottie (Simon Pegg): "You're from the future? Do they still have sandwiches there?" It's the important questions posed by JJ Abrams that makes places like Ike's worth checking out.
I'm no doubt still a fan but no "yay" today. I ordered a Menage a Trois, and I expected the sandwich to be a dirty, messy, gooey, sticky chewy piece of work. The sandwich is supposed to be dripping at the bottom because of the dirty sauce and honey, and whatever else may be in there. I don't even know if they included the honey and cheese. The stack of napkins they gave us - we only used two each. What in the world? I'm just wondering if the cool person who made my sandwich that day was just mad. I hope he or she is okay now, because if not, I don't think I want the Menage a Trois anymore. They might have to come up with a Menage a Quatre or Cinq.
Ike's is amazing! The line is getting ridiculous though. I was starved for 45mins before getting this super tasty sandwich! Taste-wise, it scored full points.I took off a star because we asked them to cut the sandwiches 3-ways, as there were 3 of us and we wanted to sample different flavors, in the end the sandwiches were only cut into halves.
wow. 1000+ reviews .. what do i even add on? i haven't yelped in a long time because i'm lazy and i write 24/7 for school now, but i decided to come back JUST to review this place. is it a small ass hole in the wall? yes. are there any seats outside? like one. but basically no. is it a long wait? yes. is it worth it? HELL MOTHAFUCKEN YES! luckily we found parking right across the street. boyfriend ordered the one with all the meat and i had the "say hey" [pastrami, swiss, bacon, and all the fixings] on dutch crunch. we chilled outside as we waited, no problem since it was a beautiful day in the city. the wait actually wasn't too bad, maybe 10 minutes or so. take into fact they heat the sandwiches and they are BUSSSSY. finally we got our loot and headed off to dolores park. there are no words. the bread is freshly baked everyday and you can tell. the dirty sauce is amazing and adds great flavor and kick to the sandwich. there was a damn good amount of meat, but it was still in good ratio to the rest of the fixings. as for the price? let's put it into perspective: a lame ass sandwich from A.G. ferrari will set you back about $9 and it's nowhere near the level ike's place is on. i seriously wanna eat one everyday. it's THAT good!
Ike's has the best sandwiches in the world! The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the crazy long wait.So yummy and the options are endless for meat-eaters and veggies. Everyone that lives/visits SF should plan a stop at Ike's, but, as stated already, do not go there if you are already starving as it can easily take one hour to get fed. I leave about one block away and can see the line out of Ike's Place at 10am in the morning, cuz this place is darn good!Bring time or, even better, if you live near, call it in. Ike's is a tiny place with no seating inside and little seating outside, so try to beat rush hour. Tip:Check out the menu online as it is extensive and once you're up at the counter you're gonna have to order right away. No time to start reading the menue with 40+ sandwiches thereDef worth going though!
Over 2500 reviews, geez. What more can I say that hasn't been said already?! Well, I get excited about this place and I wanna show them some love, so here's my review:Sometimes sandwiches can be boring, but not when they're made exactly the way you want them... just like they do here. I love Ike's sandwiches!!! You want choices? You'll get them here. They have a huge variety. My favorite sammie is Hollywood's SF Cheesesteak (my mouth is watering). And I really like how their orders come with a caramel apple lolli :)Hey Ike! I hope one day you'll open up shop over here in San Jose!
I went to Ike's Place about a month ago. It was delicious! It has a wide selection of sandwiches and options. They include various types of chips that I've never tasted before. And they even had some (albeit limited) sitting area inside. The line was pretty long on a Sunday afternoon though. Be prepared to wait 20-30 minutes.
First time I came here, I was AMAZED. The sandwich menu alone is impressive! I always get the menage a trois (bbq chicken with red onions and honey). Super good. Plus, you get a yum lollipop! The next few times I visited, I still thought it was great.By the tenth time or so, ehh not so impressed. Am I just used to it? I even tried switching up my sandwich order. I dunno. The bread is still good, but I feel like the love is gone. A little pricey, but I guess it's worth it. Too bad it doesn't come with a drink or chips.
I'm not a huge mayo fan so I was hesitant on ordering my sandwich with the Dirty Sauce, but I had to try it after all the hype.  It's the bomb.com!!  It does give you major garlic breath - YUM - but they give you a caramel apple lollipop to sweeten your breath.Make sure you grab extra napkins. You're going to need them!
The best damn sandwich I've had so farI love the 660 (not on menu but they'll know when you order it) and the Menage a Trois. There are still so many I haven't tried, but I don't get tired of the 660! The place is ridiculously popular so the wait time is kind of long. Best thing to do might be to order beforehand by phone and go there to pick it up. It's usually about $10 for a sandwich, but it's pretty big and it usually fills me up. It also comes with a bag of chips and a lollipop.
Finally, my Ike's virginity has been taken away. Was here on Monday around 1pm. Small line, 5 min wait. Workers were really helpful with sandwich choicesHad the menage de trois and bf had the kryptonite-biggest sandwich on the menu-easy 5lbs. It has all the deli meats, jalepeno poppers, onion rings and i think moz sticks. It was big enough to feed 4. With just a few napkins and the sidewalk as our dining table we looked like scavengers devouring our food. Very messy. Just don't want to think about the calories we consumed that day.o. overheard that they are opening up another located on Standford campus. 3 months? can't get enough of their dirty sauce and must have their dutch crunch.
YUM! Try the Milf and the Backstabber (i love these names)! They are big and messy so you will need napkins, a table, a cold drink, and a blanket for the food coma that is likely to come. Do yourself a favor and order your sandwich ahead of time because the wait is long! I like to look at the menu on my phone and just order on my way there. It is worth the wait!Try it. Love it. Repeat.
I went to the ever popular Ike's deli and ordered the Damon Bruce & my son had the Matt Cain. Both our sandwiches were excellent! This place is incredible. I don't think that you can go wrong with anything on the menu. Good job Ike's!!!
My grandma literally lives right there, on the cross street, and I never noticed the line before. I'm always with my mom and the kids when we're in that area tho and waiting is not on their priority of things to do. Neither are sandwiches that have lots of "stuff" in them.The Mr apparently sends out minions to get his Ike's when he's at work and he's all about the sandwiches. So this was a well thought out plan to get some sandwiches for me and the Mr. lol. We had to be in the area, so I called the order in. I honestly do NOT think I was talking to a real person. Automated. Not for certain. Of course I also called when they first opened, and got busy after busy after busy signal. And finally after 10x I'd say, ringing. Whew! We were quoted a 35 minute wait. Not bad considering all these other people talking hours. Scored a primo parking space and sent the Mr out to retrieve sandwiches: Shawn Michaels for him Spiffy Tiffy for me. And we were on our way to next destination. He's all about those fried mozzarella sticks in there *rolling eyes*. I had a taste of his sandwich, and it was MEH to me. lol. My Spiffy Tiffy was good, what a wonderful combination of yumtasticness.I'd definitely say peruse the menu online and call your order in. I've passed by the place a # of times and the lines are no joke.And PLEASE let's keep this Ike's location open in San Francisco people. No sitting on the neighboring steps and leaving your garbage there. Not cool. We don't want to have to drive down the peninsula for sandwiches. And FYI the Redwood Shores location is NOT open on weekends, what would we do if they honestly shut the SF location down. Well yeah we'd drive down the peninsula I'm sure but here's hoping we don't have to!
This place needs no introduction. The gf and I are always looking for new spots to chow down to. She remembered Ike's was on Man vs. Food, so we had to check it out. There was a long line when we got there, it does not move fast! It was about a 1 hour wait. Do yourself a favor and CALL IN before hand. This will give you a better idea of what you want because there is seriously over 150 sandwiches on the menu. Prices are average, $7-$9 depending what you get. Although, you get a lot.We both ended up getting the SF Giant, recommended by the guy in the front. BOMB DIGGITY! There is only one other place I can think of that would come close to this place (Freshly Baked in San Jose), but Ike's blew me away. Definitely coming back in the future to try out the other sandwiches.
Ike's sammies are truly an explosion of flavor in your mouth (and sometimes in your hand). Call your order in, get your sammie EXTRY DIRTY and on CRUNCH bread and thank me later =) If you're the type to always have room for dessert walk/roll yourself over to Bi-Rite and get a scoop of salted caramel after and be a happy fatty!
Saw them on the food network (man vs. food show) and had to check it out. They were right, this is a great sandwich place. I love that the sandwiches are warm, very tasty, and unique. We tried the Kryptonite (the really big one) and it was interesting, but honestly not as good as the Matt Cain or the Menage a trois.Tiny place w/ v. little seating, and sometimes a long wait. Worth it though!  Already been back.
3.5 starsWas it a really good sammy? Yes.Was it totally unhealthy? Yes.Did I probably gain 5 pounds from that thing? Probably.Was it worth the wait? Hmm...I have to rethink this one.All in all, that sandwich did rock BUT an hour wait for a sandwich that cost nearly $16 (with the extra fixings) was totally not worth my time. Sorry to all you Ike's Place fans, it was good but not THAT good.
ummm hello, amazing sandwich! The lines can be annoying, so I tend to call in my orders and just pick them up. Employees are always super nice too!
Has just enough of every ingredients. I would definitely eat here again. Note there isn't any eating space and lines can get long so make sure to call at least 45mins to and hr before you want to eat.
never thought sandwich could taste so goooooood !
Ike was the snake and I bit off his sandwich. Though it didn't all happen around a tree but at a cute little neighborhood store in the Castro. By the way, I'm a health nut who has good discipline when I face greasy, carb filled meals but this time I surrendered to the temptation after gawking at a couple sandwiches making its way toward the hungry customers, with their scent trails outside Ike's....No regrets.I had the 'Pride of Castro' sandwich. An out of the ordinary sandwich filled with ham, turkey, brie along with lettuce, tomato, mayo, mustard and here comes the drum roll.....served HOT & DIRTY as in their dirty dirty secret sauce on dutch crunch bread. I believe their bread is homemade.My friend had the Doomsday...which is the ever so popular one that I heard. Doomsday had all these meats...the total works: Roast beef, corned beef, pastrami, salami, turkey, bacon, ham with mozzarella sticks. Drum roll please.... served HOT & DIRTY as in their dirty sauce on sourdough bread!!Very informative & funny cashier guy who helped me, a first timer, choose from the menu. The service was fab and a lot of the hipsters working here seem to know their sandwiches really well.Bring your empty stomach and a tube of antibacterial solution for your greasy paws because your first couple bites off the sandwich will eventually turn into a gooey but satisfying mess at the end...think Joey Chestnut during a hot dog eating contest.
We went here before they got all crazy but it was crazy to begin with. We did our research and looked online to preplan our meal. I was totally overwhelmed by their menu and was completely lost on what I would order. After skimming it for a good 10 mins we decided to just head on down there and wing it. There was NO line and Ike was there. He was super nice and took the time to talk to us. What we ordered was good but definitely not the best we've had. I don't remember exactly was it was but I know I got chicken something. I was surprised to find my chicken shredded instead of whole. Costco brand canned chicken? I hope not. Nonetheless the sandwich was good and the fact that there are millions of different types of sandwiches to choose from I gave them an extra star. I'm sure when I go back I'll find my nirvana in a sandwich there.
Mmmm Yummy! Would love to keep coming here and trying different sandwiches but so much work to get a sandwich (parking, WAITING, waiting, & Waiting). I have two lil ones & an impatient hubby so gotta save it for when I have time. Hopefully when they move they get a place with more space, seating & staff. I like Ikes :)
Came here after a free day at the Cal Academy of Sciences. Not to mention a freezing day in San Francisco (low 50's in July?) Come on Bay Area. As a big fan of Man vs. Food, I like going to featured restaurants, and I'd been meaning to visit for a long time. It was a surprisingly small establishment for the number of customers that go there, so a lot of people are always hanging outside on the sidewalk. Apparently they're getting sued by neighbors for this. It was a considerable wait (approx 30 min), but not bad considering what I've heard from other people (we went around 3 in the afternoon on a weekday).The "Name of Girl I'm Dating" on Dutch Crunch (extra dirty) was delicious, as was the gf's "Reuben." It definitely lived up to the hype, but it was a tad bit expensive for what I got (about $10+ a sandwich). Would I go again? Probably, if I'm in the area and the wait isn't too long.Definitely worth going to at least once, as it has become an iconic establishment in the Castro District. Bring your own drink and don't plan on eating there, as there's no seating anywhere close. We ate up the hill using the trunk of our car as a table (ingenius!). Very creative sandwich names, unique creations. Final verdict, 4 starrrs.
Very tasty! Ike's a genius. And he trains his staff well!
I've never actually had to wait for a sandwich here -- both times I've had a sandwich a coworker has picked them up, so I'm not even influenced by the appointments (HINT: HIRE additional staff if business is that good!) and wait time.The food is just truly mediocre. The rolls are run-of-the-mill probably bought from Costco. The fillings are completely average meat or veggie burgers. I had some sort of turkey with cranberry, and it seriously tasted like the ingredients were straight from Trader Joe's. Nothing wrong with TJ, I eat there all the time, but a 5-star hype it does not make. I made the mistake of not saying "no" to the special sauce on my veggie burger. Ugh. People, their dirty sauce is MAYO probably with a bunch of Lawry's mixed in. If you slopped a third of a cup of mayo on any other turkey sandwich or veggie burger it would have the same effect: the fat and sodium sends your endorphins rushing and you feel all happy and sated. It's no different from what any other fast food establishment does.There's nothing particularly wrong with Ike's, but there's nothing particularly right with it either. It's got mediocre ingredients covered up with a cheap trick of globs of fat and sodium. Call me a food snob, but hey, I don't eat McDonald's either.
I remember discovering Ike's on yelp as I was going through my sandwich craze phase. All it took to convince me was a look at their menu. BOY DID I FEEL LIKE A KID AT THE CANDY STORE. SCOREEEEEEE! I absolutely love creativity and it shows on their menu. They've crafted a number of delectable sandwiches and ingredients in each sandwich compliments the entire sandwich.The first time I ordered (name of girl I'm Dating), mostly because I couldn't help the avocado and honey mustard part. and boy was it delicious! It also comes with a Tootsie pop. Don't expect to find seating, you'll be less disappointed if you expect to walk and eat. My sandwich got a little messy to eat but still good, soggy bread and all!
I am sitting here about to die."Why?", you ask?Because I just ate enough at Ike's to fill a pigeon for a year.Well, maybe not that much. I got the "Womanizer" with vegan chicken nuggets, vegan cheese, mushrooms, avocado, and all of the regular sandwich fixings minus the pepperoncinis.My sandwich was incredible. It was a little too filling in fact, because I hate eating and then feeling like I'm carrying a bowling ball in my stomach.My sister got the vegan BBQ sandwich which I took a bite of and I just may get that next time.We split a large fries which ended up going home with us.I've eaten here once before and didn't want to write a review just yet, and I got the vegan combo and it was really good, but there are so many different options on the menu that I didn't feel experienced enough to write one.Oh, and I have never in my life seen such beautiful men making sandwiches,*WARNING* This is probably a really really really terrible place to come on a first date. These sandwiches get so messy that it's kind of really embarrassing and unless you and your date are comfortable enough to lick sauce off of each others faces, I suggest at the very most ordering a salad or fries instead from here.
This review will be short, since I am typing in a horizontal position - I just wolfed down an entire Elvis Keith (#1: chicken, teriyaki, wasabi mayo, and Swiss on Dutch crunch) and need to lay down for a while. But it was good. Real good. Next time I'm goin' for the Backstabber!I saw Adam Richman (Man vs. Food) filming here about a month ago trying to take down a Doomsday (roast beef, corned beef, pastrami, salami, turkey, bacon, ham, mozzerella sticks, stuffed jalapeno poppers, and avocado) and boy was I swooning. Damn, I love a man who can eat.
Ok so i'm re-rating ike's and adding 1 star. i am impressed and will definitely go back more often now that i have found the right sandwich.I guess a lot of the rating goes with finding the right sammie for you, and let me TELL YOU, did i find the right sammie.i call it the "shadi swing my way" ha hait is....are u ready for this....TurkeyAvocado /(extra av!)HavartiCream cheese... Franks red hot sauceHoney MustardSourdough RollEXTRA DIRTYor basically the BARRY Z withCream cheese... Franks red hot sauceHoney MustardSourdough RollEXTRA DIRTYi am obsessed. enjoy
You've got to have no taste buds if you don't like Ike's. The longest I've waited was an hour for my sandwich. (Now I know better to call in my order, look for parking, chill for a bit, and then hop to Ike's). They have a crazy drink selection, so make sure the boys who work there pick a good one for you ;)Try the blind date (vegetarian)and the meatless mike (vegan)You won't regret it!
There isn't anything I can say that hasn't already been said.Dutch Crunch always, too good to pass up, Dirty sauce... more more more. Smoked Gouda, oh please say it's a dream.It's the right sandwich for the right time. Ike's has taken something so simple and given it fresh life again. I live in L.A. County, and I can say that there is no shop anywhere around that can compare to the home like atmosphere that is created here. Everyone that works there is nice and polite.My recent visit was during what looks like expansion, looks like the massive demand calls for more space. Orders are taken outside the door and the line is down the block. A good twenty mins to look up and down the menu then another twenty mins to get your food.The Al Bundy is amazing and even better that there isn't anywhere to sit, i went to the nearby park and enjoyed utter bliss.good luck on parking, so plan ahead and place an order but be sure you have an hour or so to wait.
As part of my Chicagoan-in-SF tour, my cousin took me to Ike's today. He warned me that sandwiches are huge and usually last him two meals, so we split the Name of Girl I'm Dating (halal chicken, honey mustard, avocado, pepper jack).  I normally insist on whole grain bread, but I was glad I tried it on their signature dutch crunch...definitely not the healthiest option, but it was sooo good! They usually have long lines, but if you call ahead and order, you can skip it and just pick up your sandwich. They don't have any seating, we took our sandwich to the nearby Delores park and took in the beautiful views while we ate.Considering the yelp-hype, I think it was all that and a bag of chips. Literally. With your sandwich, they give you a bag of chips.
Another hyped up place that delivers the goods.Sandwiches I've had so far:1. Elvis Keith, on dutch crunch. Halal Chicken Breast, Teriyaki, Wasabi Mayo, Swiss. Loved it.2. Manage-a-Trois, on dutch crunch. Halal Chicken Breast, Real Honey, Honey Mustard, BBQ, PepperJack, Swiss, Smoked Gouda. Loved it.The dirty sauce probably blends and deliciously obscures the other flavors in the sandwich, but I'm okay with that. It's not unlikely to have a two-hour wait for a sandwich on a weekday, so it's not a bad idea to call in the order.
So not gonna lie, I felt a little cliche/touristy to go here, since I've seen this place on food network, and every person I know has told me to go here since moving to the city, but I had to see what all the fuss was about!I somewhat expected it to be a bit of a novelty, as my friend had recommended a sandwich that weighed 6 pounds, and I was aware that they had some clever names for their sandwiches. After getting lost a bit after realizing they had moved we found it in the nick of time without a line. It smelled delicious so my suspicions started to fade. The menu won points because it had sandwiches named after Giants players OTHER than Barry Bonds and Tim Lincecum (although those were included as well) so they clearly were true fans. I ordered the Mnage  trois, a BBQ chicken sandwich, and Catherine ordered the Paul Rueben's. I asked the guy working what bread was best and he said Dutch Crunch. In that moment he had my vote for life. The sandwiches were out of this world. I don't even really know how to describe them. There were flavors I had never tasted on sandwich before and both sandwiches struck the perfect balance of crunchy vs. juicy, meaty vs bready etc. SO delicious. And you got a lolly-pop and a bag of chips. This is not just a tourist spot, these sandwiches are the real deal.
I came here because of the so many good reviews on Yelp. This place didn't fail to impress me. I love their sandwiches!
The mnage  trois on a dutch crunch roll is one of the greatest sandwiches I have ever eaten. The sandwich comes with a bag of Dirty potato chips that are also really good - get the "Funky Fusion" flavor.Order ahead over the phone at least an hour in advance to avoid waiting in line.
I wanted to eat at Ike's Place primarily because I love watching Man vs Food. Like many San Francisco native say, Ike's Place is that "whole in a wall" restaurant. The location did not resemble what was shown in Man vs Food. As expected, the line was out the door. While waiting in line anxiously anticipating this once in a life time dinning experience, I began to note the restaurant's environment. The walls was saturated with awards for serving the best sandwiches. The restaurant was small and extremely crowded. There was no tables present in or outside of the restaurant. Aside from a couple of chairs, most customers ate their food while standing. I ordered the "Paul Reubens," which tasted like a Quizno's sub. I was disappointed that I might have chosen the wrong sandwich to represent Ike's Place as a whole but this was the same sandwich that was mentioned in the show and was awarded by the city. Perhaps on my next visit, I will try another sandwich that best fits my taste buds.
Been here twice and loved it each time. I always try to make a picnic date when I go there because there is no room to sit, even if you are lucky to find a table, it's just really awkward eating when there is a long line of people over your shoulder waiting to order. But the sandwiches, amazing! Full with fatty goodness!
Saw this place on man vs food. OMFG the dude ate the Kryptonite sandwich in 1 sitting, WTF! Came here with Dee, Jerad & aniki. I got the "hella fat bastard" excellent. bought aniki the Kryptonite which its the biggest one they sell, its also as big as his head, and weighed about as much, "he has a huge dome". He's also an eating machine, and could only finish 1/2. I got my nephew "The Doomsday" which is the second biggest, and he eats more than aniki, he ate 1/2 and was so full that it made me uncomfortable.
I like trying new things; that's one of the best things about San Francisco--there are always new places to check out. However, as a diner, I tend to avoid ordering sandwiches because frankly, most places overcharge for them. A couple slices of bread with a few ingredients between = 6, 8, 10+ dollars? No thanks.So you can imagine my scepticism when the suggestion was made to give Ike's a try. Despite all of the glowing reviews, how good could it really be? They ARE still just sandwiches.As it turns out, they are just...the best sandwiches I've ever had. They may not be super cheap, but they're not expensive either. Served as two-handfuls of sandwich that could very well be shared by two people or across two meals, you definitely get your money's worth.The insanely long list of possibilities might be overwhelming, but the staff was very helpful in narrowing things down, along with some friendly bystanders in line who chimed in with their own anecdotal evidence. It's interesting to note that any of their sandwiches can apparently be made meatless/vegetarian, but I'm not afraid of things like ham, so their #20 - Paradise Found really lived up to its name.As a side note: being a gamer, I was pleased to see not only a few Nintendo-themed options like Mario, Luigi and Bowser, but also the clever meatless versions being the anti-heroes Wario, Waluigi, etc. Brilliant.The place is tiny--no seating room at all that I could see except a few small tables on the sidewalk nearby, and most of the sidewalk was occupied by the crowd of customers--but for all those people, the wait time was acceptable (~10 minutes).But on top of the absolutely excellent food, what really blew me away was the service. Yes, the staff was helpful choosing my lunch, but Ike himself wiggles through the crowd and hand-delivers each sandwich personally, recites the order for accuracy, and even makes some genuine, polite small talk before wishing them off to enjoy. It's no exaggeration for me to say that this place has THE BEST service of any place I've been in America, seriously.Bottom line: great menu selection, unbelievable sandwiches, unmatched service. Worth it, no matter what your excuse.
What can I say that hasn't already been said? Best sandwiches I've ever had, dirty sauce is the bomb, innovative combinations, great bread, yaddah, yaddah.How about this: A friend of mine cannot eat gluten AT ALL. So I call in and order the gluten free bread, I tell them my friend has celiac disease, and WITHOUT MISSING A BEAT, the woman on the phone says, "no problem, I'll let them know." I come in to pick the sandwiches up an hour and half later (because only a fool doesn't call ahead), and one of the guys from the back comes out to tell me they CLEANED THE COUNTER AND THE KNIVES before making her sandwich.Above and beyond folks. Above and beyond.
AMAZING. Kind people, amazing food, good deal. No seating, though--more of a take and go kinda place. Either way, if a gigantic, sloppy (in a good way) sandwich is what your aching for, go here immediately. Vegetarians wholly welcome. Many delicious options.
Um can you really add fried onion rings, jalapeno poppers and mozzarella sticks to a sandwich? Apparently you can here. And if you call it in, even 5 minutes before they open, they won't take your order. Though the last time I did, he said he'd let me order just that one time. But then how were there 25 sandwiches ahead of me, if you don't take the order before you open? Either way, this is worth it if you want that unique sandwich you cannot get elsewhere. ie. full of dirty sauce, toppings and piled high with really bad for you food. But if you just want a ham and cheese sandwich, plain, you are so better off going elsewhere. Don't wait in line here. You'll just get upset with yourself.
It was a good thing our wait wasn't that long because a 1 hour to 2 hour wait for a sandwich like this is not worth it. I had the Nacho Boy sandwich -- roast beef, dutch crunch, with the works. The roast beef was fine, nothing outstanding. The bread was fine as well, but nothing great. The dutch crunch at Little Lucca Sandwich shop in South San Francisco is better (much more tender and crunchy at the same time, but I grew up with bread since I grew up in South City). I felt that the avocado in my sandwich somehow negated the flavor of my Nacho Boy. In addition, the dirty sauce was nothing to write home about. My dad had the Pastrami, Bacon sandwich. I don't remember what it's called. His sandwich was fine too. Nothing special. My dad, though not a foodie or a chowhound by any means, also thought that the pastrami sandwich from Little Lucca is better. Why? He said it was because of the bread. Would I go back? Sure. Then again, I only waited for about 10 minutes. If the line was more than that, absolutely not.
Second time trying this place. First time was in Cupertino's location and I absolutely LOVED the "Curtis" which is their Halal Chicken, marinara sauce, and mozzarella sandwich that I decided to stuff with BEER BATTERED ONION RINGS!! Best creation ever (w/o the Dirty Sauce, though. Not too much of a fan). Overall, awesome place with a really great team working both behind the counter and in the kitchen. Will definitely be back whenever I'm in the Castro area. :)
The mnage a trois was saucy heaven!
The Kryptonite was great just a little too big. Definitely split it with someone. I was not a fan of Ike's cola.
The sandwiches here are definitely worth checking out. I came with a group of friends a couple of months back. We waited in line for about 30 minutes, but it was definitely worth it.The sandwiches are all very unique and extremely flavorable! There's something for everyone. Be sure to come with an empty and hungry stomach!
Stood in line for about 40-45 minutes on a Sunday noon making it our last meal before driving back to LA. It was such a nice, beautiful day out, although I was a little groggy from the night before due to food coma. I don't mind coming home with a few, extra pounds- SF has the best food!The group behind us was obnoxious and having endured that for the time that I did was worse than the time I spent on my feet. I rather would have stood for 2 hours in silence. ALL that was worth the quality of food I received. Best sandwich EVER. I got the Nacho Girl with salmon, mushrooms, swiss cheese, and some other goodies. It was juicy, flavorful, perfectly balanced and made me wish I had bought 7, so it could have lasted me a whole week in Los Angeles. The only sandwich place I'm familiar with around here is Subway. I WILL move to SF someday and Ike's Place will be 75% of the reason why. I envy whomever lives above it.
Really debated between 3 and 4 stars on this one. For what it is, they do a great job. This is not a clean healthy little sandwich. It's big, it's messy, it's beyond filling. Come here if you want to feel disgustingly full and overindulge. Do not come here if you're looking for a pansy salad-type lunch.The menu, like the feeling I got after finishing (well, nearly finishing) one of their sandwiches, is overwhelming. I love all the fun names for the sandwiches. Did not love the claustrophobic feeling I got when ordering inside- seriously, it's like being shoved inside a NYC apartment's closet with 15 other people. We did have to wait about 15 min or so for our sammies, but I really didn't think the wait was bad at all, nor was the line crazy. We were there at around 1 on a weekday.Being vegetarian, I really appreciated all the fake meat options. Personally, I don't like fake meat since I stopped eating the real thing b/c I didn't like the taste, but I can appreciate the availability of this sort of thing for those that want it. Now for the sandwich description: I got the Peg Bundy- eggplant, cheese, fresh dressing, avacado, and the usuals- lettuce, tomato, dirty sauce. Overall, it was tasty. It was a big, dirty, yummy, verging on greasy-spoon/diner type meal. I actually thought to myself when I opened up the wrapping (we got it to go & went to Dolores- I recommend!), "Hey, it's not THAT big." I finished half and thought to myself, "I should probably stop." But it was just tasty enough to keep going.... made it through about half of the other half, and then wanted to vomit. I felt like absolute sh*t the rest of the day. The eggplant was good but a little too heavy & slightly greasy feeling, or maybe it was the quantity of mush I consumed- avacado, dressing, and dirty sauce kind of souped together into a big spread soft topping squeezed into the bread- Dutch crunch- pretty good but didn't make or break it for me. Overall, I'd say in my world of eating this is 3.5 stars, because I prefer healthier stuff where it's all about the ingredients and not mainly about the quantity. Also, I wasn't blown away by any flavors or ingredients- they were all "A-OK" good, not "wooohooo" or "YAY!" (even the "dirty sauce"). Plus, I rarely give out 5 stars and 4 stars in my book is damn good. But like I said, for what it is, this place does a good job of consistently serving up big satisfying sandwiches. Plus Ike was super friendly.
Honestly, I can't rave enough about this place. It's like when you find something awesome and you want to tell everyone you know about it. It was like that for me. I went twice in one week...if that tells you anything.I've tried the Name of the Girl I'm Dating and the Manage a Trois. Both are amazing, wonderfully unique sandwiches that are extremely well made. Their menu is quite long and detailed, and both times I went which was weekday evenings the line wasn't too bad. The staff was friendly and one time we were lucky and went during happy hour which meant we got free drinks (get the rootbeer!) & chips to munch on while waiting around 10 mins for our sandwiches to be ready. Things to know:1. dutch crunch is a must2. dirty sauce is a must3. nowhere to sit inside, most people eat in their cars4. you will have to wait outside so dress warm! its sf
THIS PLACE HAD THE BEST SANDWICH I'VE EVER HADIt was my first time here, and the cashier was super nice and helpful. I wanted pastrami, so he recommended the 660 sandwich. I decided to get sourdough bread and everything in it. AGAIN, IT WAS THE BEST SANDWICH I'VE EVER HADThe sourdough bread was just perfect. Crispy, but NOT crunchy. They also dont skimp on ingredients in their sandwiches. I got lots of lettuce and tomatoes and just the right amount of banana peppers. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. I better visit again soon. 6-7pm is happy hour, so you can get drinks for free from the fridge on the right. The fridge on the left has more unique drinks which go for $1 at this time.
Update: I have discovered a new favorite sandwich at Ike's: the Papa Sam.The guy behind the counter was not Ike... still don't know who he is... apparently he's some Greek God in human form serving heavenly sandwiches.
Went to SF solely to come to this spot after seeing it on man vs food. When we got there the line was about three buildings away which was not bad at all. The wait was about 30 mins. I had already made my decision before coming here and knew I wanted the "superman" and decided to get it on a dutch crunch. A few of us decided to split a few sandwiches so we got that, 1/2 spiffy and a milf all on Dutch crunch. What can I say the dirty sauce does make the sandwich much better and the bread was delicious. Slighty crunchy top with a generous amount of meat. To top off a great sandwich with a awesome leninade drink we got to take a picture with Ike. Will be back there for sure the next time I am in SF.
Expensive.. checkworth it.. check can't find parking to save my life.. checkwaiting in line for hella long.. checkordered.. eli manning ( halal chicken with sauteed mushrooms, DIRTY SAUCE!! all the fixin's avocado) and I added mozzerallo sticks in too!!! checkjust gained 15 pds.. checkworth the food coma, and after work out reward.. checkWill come back and go through the same shit.. check check check check!!
The best sandwiches in San Francisco by far. I literally used to not eat sandwiches but after trying Ikes I can't stop eating them. The backstabber is probably my favorite, chicken and artichoke hearts are sooo good together.
Oh my God....Oh. My. God.
My god - fanfuckingtastic.This place is the portal between heaven and earth.Think I'm lying or being over the top? Well, try their BLT or Tony Soprano, hell try anything. Things to not try - don not try to be in a hurry and do not try to be a meany while in line.
Barry Bonds number of home runs: 762Number of times I've eaten a Barry B (turkey, bacon, swiss) from Ike's: 669I expect to beat his record by next summer.
Very good sandwiches, but the line is insane.
This time I came on a weekend so meaning there was a line!! None of my friends have eaten here but me, and they all loved! I split an eli manning #100 with my friend, and ordered some mozzarella sticks on the side since they don't serve fries over the weekend. boo. but it's okay the mozzarella sticks were good. But the sandwich was ESPECIALLY GOOD! Two of my friends ordered the kryptonite #200, they were insane to finish that, loaded with meat, and other stuff. HUGE. Anyways this time it came with a cotton candy lollipop :) LOVE THIS PLACE!
Ah-mazing.
It was my first time dining here. Ike's definitely lives up to its hype!!! I love sandwiches. Mmm. The people working there and my fellow customers were all so friendly! I hope Ike's isn't evicted cause I need to try moar sandwiches!I had the following:[Name of Girl I'm Dating] : Halal Chicken Breast, Honey Mustard, Avocado, PepperJack $9.99- Deliiiiicious! That honey mustard did some real good to that chicken breast, wow.Jeries' BIG Meat Sandwich : Turkey, Roast Beef, Pastrami, Ham, Salami, Jack $11.11 - This sandwich was twice or more the size of Name of Girl I'm Dating. No really, it's huge. It's also a really messy sandwich. And dang tasty at that! I love pastramiiiii.Also ordered:- Noyu Oolong Lychee Tea (tasted more like apples to me (there was apple concentrate in there)).- Dirty Chips in Salt & Vinegar and Jalapeno Heat (Can't go wrong with these two flavors).Have half of each sandwich left waiting for me in my fridge and I can't wait to devour them tomorrow. :)
As Usher would say O.M.G! This place has the best sandwiches anywhere! I've been there twice and I'm going to keep going back. So far I've had the Hella Fat Bastard on Dutch Crunch and the Manage-a-Trois. Writing this review up makes me want to go get an Ike's sandwich.
Hands down my favorite sandwich place i've tried thus far!! mmm..mmm..good. I'm in love with the Backstabber sandwich....amazing! I need to definitely go back and get more before i leave the bay area.Freaking delicious.....go get a sandwich.....actually, no don't get one...you'll make the line a whole lot longer...stay HOME!!!!
FOODGASM-Literally as good as it gets!The long wait is totally worth it! This place makes all different types of sandwiches, veggie and vegan too! They also give you a caramel apple lollipop and free chips with each order. I love how creative they are with naming there sandwiches. I usually order the Change which is steak, bbq sauce, gouda, and onion rings...the also put "dirrtyy sauce" on each sandwich which taste really good. DID I FORGET TO MENTION THESE SANDWICHES ARE HUGE? Def. not greedy with their sizing!!!! Keep in mind this place is just an order and go kinda place, but you can eat on the curb, in your car or what I like to do is go to Delores Park which is like 5min away
Best sandwiches in the bay area. Just had the Paul Reubens (sliced corned beef, homemade poppy seed coleslaw, French dressing and Swiss cheese piled on Dutch crunch bread) for the first time and it was delicious - highly recommend it. But don't just take my word for it, the Paul Reubens was named the #2 sandwich in America by HuffPo: huffingtonpost.com/endle). Go here for an easy, but amazing lunch!
amazing!
I gotta admit, I didnt like the prices or the fact thete is usually a long line....but after visiting there site, I decided to try them... Not to mention the yelp reviews.I ordered over the phone n headed there shortly. Parking sucks, you gotta find a spot.Got there, and no big line!Food was ready n they offered free drink n chips!I got the 'name of girl im dating'... I loved how it tasted!..So imma fan amd will be back.
This place is a mecca. You just gotta come here not just once though. You have to come again and again because there are just too many awesome sandwiches to try.I'm so sad I didn't eat here earlier. You will be entertained by the names of all the sandwiches and you will be distressed when you inch closer to the the door b/c there's too many sandwiches to choose from. It's pricey for sandwiches but each sandwich comes w/ a bag of Dirty Chips and a lolli.The Menage a Trois was awesome. The honey made is so good. But I made the mistake of convincing my friend to split the Superman with me too. The Superman was meant to be split amongst 2 hungry people not 2 semi-full people. The thing is gigantic and one half was the size of one whole Menage a Trois. Needless to say, we were disgustingly full.Call in and pick up your order, then go to Dolores Park to eat and watch dogs. Afterwards, go to Bi-rites down the block. Grab something from Tartine's and a Margherita Pizza from Delfina across the street for later consumption and you'll have The perfect day.
They have pretty good vegan sandwiches but they aren't the greatest things ever. I probably could have made a better sandwich.
Delicious, but I felt like I was eating a heart attack. Definitely call ahead if you don't want to wait 2 hours in line. We didn't have to wait but 5 minutes for our pre-ordered sammies.
Technically, this place is a 4.5. Best sandwich place ever. It's like a mix between Mr. Pickles and Beach Hut Deli, but better. Their dutch crunch bread is the best (better than Mr. Pickles) and the dirty sauce is what makes the sandwich. The bread for your sandwich is baked to order, so very fresh. My friend got the Superman, which was loaded with all kinds of meat: roast beef, corned beef, pastrami, salami, turkey, bacon, and ham....it's a whole lotta sandwich. Fresh meats and fresh veggies with great bread. What can get better.Friendly staff... the guy dressed up nicely in a collared shirt and dress pants asked us people in line to sing Happy Birthday for this girl that just got her sandwich. The downside was the long wait, an hour or so to order and get our sammich....so don't go on a Saturday afternoon. Also, the place is super small, old, and kinda dirty. Overall, well worth the wait.
Oh Ike's i wish i could take you back with me to Orange County and have you anytime i was craving a BIG yummi Sandwich! But sadly you will always remain in San Fran along with alot of other yummi places that i enjoyed while i was visiting!!Let me say one thing, this area rocked, loved it so much!! Parking isnt to bad either. I like to walk and since it was a nice sunny kind of warm day it was prefect. When we got there, the line wasnt long at all and was moving pretty fast (thanks to having 3 cashier's). The place is small, and there is no seating inside. So you are pretty much having to order then going outside to eat (beware you will get in trouble if you sit on other peoples stoops). With that being said, i was in total awe of Ike's menu so much to choose from (50 different sandwiches with 50 funny names). You had your classic's with a twist, vegerarian and vegan favorites. If that wasnt enough then you had to think about what kind of bread you wanted your sandwich on (Dutch Crunch,Wheat or French bread). Ahhhh, the endless possibilities was getting to be overwhelming!! And whats all this talk about "dirty sauce" i was interested to know!!Our cashier was sweet and took our order, even when i started laughing at the name of my sandwich (Name of Girl I'm Dating-Halal chicken, honey mustard, avocado, pepper jack cheese on wheat). Prices here are a little steep, but you do get alot of food, plus we got 2 bags of Dirty Potato Chips and 2 Caramel Apple lollipops that were tucked away in our bag as a nice surprise!!As we were waiting for our food, i noticed that the small little place was getting busier by the moment. Several employee's would come out from behind the counter with brown paper bags and call out your name. Took awhile, but we finally got our sandwiches. Decided to take our lunch to the park instead of trying to find a spot to sit at.Name of Girl I'm Dating sandwich lived totally up to its name (teehehee), it was full of of the yummi goodness a sammich should be. Equal amounts of chicken, avocado and cheese. And the sauce omg there was not a dry spot at all!!! I normally never finish a sammich with bread, but this one i happily enjoyed every last bite of it!!
I wish it hadn't taken me so long to discover Ike's. Favorite sandwich in SF by far. The first time I walked in, overwhelmed. What to order. Too many choices. Ike himself walked up to me and asked if I'd ever been in, must have been the look on my face. He told me his favorite sandwich (you'll have to ask him to get that secret for yourself), which I of course ordered. Since then I have volunteered my services to be Ike's PR department. I send everyone and their brother to Ike's. I don't care if it takes me that much longer to get my sandwich. I can't let anyone miss out like I did.*great Dolores Park eat, especially for movie night!*get extra napkins these babies are messy!*get the Dutch Crunch bread, so good!
Magnificant. This place has so many reviews I don't think it even matters that I'm writing this, but I will because I love it so much.I order the Paul Reubens when I go there. Surprisingly the wait when I went there (probably because it was in the middle of the week) it wasn't busy. The corned beef with the coleslaw and the dirty sauce! It's soooo good! So much flavor in one bite! I love how they include a lollipop with each sandwich, makes me feel special.The people working there are really nice. They even brought out my sandwich when they were finished making it. Some advice, call in your order during peak hours, and prepare to wait a loooong time. the line can get kind of hectic. Trust me, everyone is hungry also, they feel your pain.There aren't a lot of places to sit, so if you want, just go to Dolores Park to eat there.
Sandwich was VERY good! Definitely coming back if i'm ever in town. The store is very simple, no tables or anything, but definitely the sandwiches are very yummy!
What can I say that hasnt already been said about ikes? Probably nothing so I'll make this one short.Call ahead if you are in a hurry, normally I only go to Ike's if I have some time to kill because I like standing in line with a friend just to talk.Get ginger beer if they have it. Thank me later.There is a massive collection of sandwiches, i suggest experiment and have a good time.pee before you arrive... not alot of private trees to do your business.
Everyone who eats sandwiches should try ikes. I came up to the sf for work and heard about ikes place and I have gone back five time in two weeks and tried four different sandwiches(17,111,89&amp;91) and loved them all. My coworkers are onto ikes...you should too!
I stood out in the rain yesterday waiting for a Nacho Boy Supreme -- and I was not alone.That's all you need to know to understand just how good Ike's is.
Ike's Place is a sandwich shop you have to eat from AT LEAST once in your life.It's usually packed, so you should call in and avoid the wait. The sandwiches are amazing especially the sauce and the added chips and lollipop just makes it harder to pass up.I had a Matt Cain and the meats with the sauce made flavors burst around and the chips made it even more flavorful.
Tony Soprano was magnificient!
The menage a trois was probably one of the best sandwich I've ever had.I think you guys all know that by now. Best sandwich right behind Ike's is probably the Fried Chicken from Bake Sale Betty. Call in advance to avoid long waits. Thats just my advice!Very friendly service, nice people.
Customer Service just doesn't cut it at IKE'S...My 14 year old son and I stopped by after so many great reviews...Music pounding...I'm OK with that...Even waiting 45 minutes...Sucks but so what...only two people were there (Woman who did all the work was delightful and funny-The guy was stoned/buzzed or had been drinking) who took your order and you pay and then have to wait another 20 minutes for another guy to come out the back door to hand us our sandwiches...Your have to be "Fing" kidding...ROFL...So my son ordered a Change and Nacho Boy, both extra dirty on Dutch Crunch..We drove to Dolores Park...parked right in front of my Old High School (Mission) and walked into the park...We found a spot with the hundreds of others enjoying the great day...I'm guessing no one who has ordered a sandwich has opened it up to see what was placed inside...I found thinly sliced meat, three (3) slices on each sandwich, and the other items listed per order...The sandwich tasted very good...I would say one of the best breads I've every had...and Ike's dirty sauce was very good..Paying over $11.00 dollars for each sandwich I did feel cheated...Yes the sandwich was better then most...but you have to look at everything your not getting for you dollar...Making a sandwich doesn't take over 10 minutes and you don't need to charge twice as much for it...You get more meat on most $5.00 dollar sandwiches...I would list this like a "Over priced Subway like sandwich at best"...(Sorry Subway for the insult) if Subway had Ike's dirty sauce and its bread, Ike's would be empty...I will not be going back...I figured two sandwiches was a fair test...I bet if you (who is reading this) will feel a lot different if you open up your sandwich and check out what your really getting...and what if they charged you $15 or $20 dollars for the same sandwich...When do you say, it's not really worth it...it does taste great but not if it's over 8 dollars...Overpriced, No customer serviceIf your down South San Francisco way try Darby Dan's Sandwiches...They have a sandwich called, The Sleeper...Off the hook...They get you in and out fast and you know you have stepped into a sandwich shop not a fly by night, bar/club/mistake...Oh...and I'm sure from San Francisco you can, at the same time get to Dan's, buy your sandwich and drive back before someone in the Ike's line has his...~Aaron
Delicious. Great value. Awesome.
Very good and tasty sandwiches. Lots of choices to choose and friendly service.
Their sandwiches are quite good, but is it worth the experience? I'm not convinced. The wait in line is long, and the menu's are really disgusting. I couldn't even read the name of the sandwich I wanted, and the last guy to handle my menu was very sick. There aren't enough menus, so you take what you can get. I guess I just cant wrap my mind around how a place generating that much revenue can't afford to print new menus every once in a while. The seating is also very limited, so don't plan on eating there.I had the stupid eggplant. The flavors were great, but the whole sandwich was dripping in grease.Absolutely worth a try if you can come by off-hours -- just don't let the yelp reviews set your expectations too high.
It seemed for a while like Ike's wa the only place everyone was talking about, except me. Why not? Well, simply because I hadn't made it there yet. Hearing from multiple friends how amazing Ike's was, I finally made it there...time to see what this place is all about.Ike's simply comes down to this....awesome sandwiches. Flavorful, fresh, and great combination of flavors. The first time I went there I thought, eh, this is okay. I mean it's good, but not absolutely amazing. Until one day, out of nowhere, I had a major craving for Ike's and since then, i'm addicted. Something about it just calls out to you.In the end the question to answer is, can I think of a better sandwich anywhere? and quite simply... no. No better sandwich out there. Try calling in your order (early), helps cut the wait time :)
Best sandwiches I've had hands down! When ever I consider this place as an option to eat out my mouth waters. Only reason I'm not eating there on a daily basis is because the old lady likes to eat at different places and has this thing about saving money. The only reason I give this place 4 four stars instead of five are because of the lack of seating, it can get a little crowded, and the fries are not good at all. Other than that the sandwiches are on point! Although the times I went they are always out of avocado. :( Guess I need to get there a little earlier. The names are of the sandwiches are also quirky too. Makes for an interesting and slightly comical time out when you go through the menu. You can call in by phone which I recommend during the rush hour because it beats standing in line. Bottom line: If you haven't gone there go now! Don't walk, run! Don't causally drive there, speed! And if you can't afford it panhandle!
I love it when places live up to the hype. I'm never really in the Castro but was showing a friend around San Francisco and finally had the opportunity to try Ike's Place. I ordered the Eli Manning on sourdough and holy crap that was a good sandwich.On top of the amazing food, I was really impressed by the staff, who were very friendly. A lot of joints with hype like Ike's Place can have some uppity staff (Bi-Rite creamery, Arinell pizza) so I was really glad to see that's not the case here.I guess the only improvement would be more places to sit, and/or an indoor seating area, but we went when it was cold as fuck and sat outside and left very happy. Yeah, it's that good. I have a feeling I will be going to the Castro more often now.
What can I say about this place that hasn't been said? I've waited in line for an hour for these sandwiches. An hour standing in front of a couple being emotionally abusive towards each other. But still worth it. The most recent adventure included a friend who lives 5 mins away so he waited in line for us. After securing rock star parking, we arrived just in time to order.MILF: I don't like BBQ sauce (generally) or shredded chicken but this sammie works. Really interested flavors. How do they come up with this stuff?Meatless Mike: I'm not a vegan but as everyone has said, this sandwich is G.O.O.D. The marinara has a great kick.
Just went here 6/24/10 and had the best sandwich in my life!I usually eat gourmet sammiches like subway but had to hit this place up because of all the hype. Parking can be Bish but its well worth it and the wait isnt too bad.I ordered a 'fat bastard' and they gave me chips with a caramel apple pop *yum*.  What makes this sandwich so great is the freshness in the sum of all the parts. Also the dirty sauce is like Bobby Flay in yo mouth.The menu is pretty vast making it hard to not have something you would like! So def. hit this place up yelpers
Probably the best sandwich I've ever had. I got the mnage a twa with jalpeno poppers and it was out of this world. Can't wait to go visit San Francisco again so I can devour some more deliciousness at Ike's.
I love sandwiches. I love the types of Deli's where I can always make my own sandwich because I am a picky eater. But at Ike's place, there's no need to make your own sandwich because they have sooooo many options for all types of sandwich lovers. I've never had to order a sandwich differently. And they are so so delicious. The only bad thing is, for those of you who hate options, there are almost TOO many options and it's hard to decide because everything looks so good. I love the Mill's Viking, the Pizzle and "The name of the girl I'm dating" sandwich. This isn't the classic Deli, Ike's place adds a twist to the good old sandwich with it's special sauce. It's not too overwhelming and it gives it something extra to enjoy! There is usually a line about 30-45min wait. But the wait is always worth it. But to avoid the line, calling in is the way to go. They give you a pick up time and almost always honor that.
I waited in line for about an hour but it was well worth it. I left with the Kryptonite and ate half on the way to the BART. I have the other half (which equals a normal footlong sandwich) in the fridge for dinner.The staff is a lot of fun and top shelf in customer service.
So many reviews for Ike's sandwiches. Sure enough, there was a LONG line halfway down the block, but you pretty much order out the door, so it's not as if there's an actual restaurant to walk into to wait.The wait was probably a little more than 30 minutes, but I walked up the street to get some coffee, so it wasn't so long for me :) When we got to the front, we found out that the owner was giving everyone a complimentary bag o' dirty chips because it was his birthday. How nice! It's HIS birthday and I get chips! :) Happy Birthday .... Ike?The guys taking orders were super friendly and full of suggestions and answers for my questions (what makes the dirty sauce dirty? Garlic, apparently). I had the Hollywood on Dutch Crunch with Salt + Vinegar chips. very good; and the bread is actually crunchy! :) The sandwich was pretty big and I almost didn't make it, but almost doesn't count and... well, I made it after all :)I don't like waiting, but it was a great sandwich; I'd make a trek back, next time we're in the city. P.S. They give you caramel apple pops with each order, man. How you gon' say no to that?! :)
YUMMMMY! I was so happy to finally try this place after hearing about it from everyone and their mother. I got the meatless mike, with the vegan meatballs and these meatballs were just as good as i had heard. To anyone who is looking for a time to skip the lines, it would appear 7:30pm on a thursday is that time. we had no line and got to sit at the table outside. awesome. delicious. worth the trek.
MILF heavenWho knew shredded chicken, franks red hot sauce, ranch and jalapeno poppers went so well together!!!!I love a place where I can go everyday and not eat the same sando for a year.
I don't know if it was that I was really hungry or if this place was really THAT good (probably a combination of both), but I thoroughly enjoyed the sandwich I ate. My friends and I made it just as they were closing. I was surprised that they treated us like they would have another customer at any other time (I've worked in the food industry and customers after hours are not fun sometimes). I really have no point of reference of another experience at this place, but from my first impressions, I thought my sandwich was super tasty. I got a sandwich called "The Name of the Girl I'm Dating." First of all... LOVE the names of these sandwiches. It really adds character to this place. Second of all, LOVE that they use halal well... EVERYTHING in their sandwiches. This one in particular was halal chicken with some sort of... goodness, my memory is slipping away from me right now... some sort of sauce (sorry, I am not helpful at all). Anyway, it was good. The sandwich is pretty huge and it comes with chips. Definitely a great meal even for dinner at the end of a long day of walking. End the night with some Bi-Rite Creamery down the street, and your night is pretty much complete. happy eating!
OMG my first yelp review!!! And how awesome is it that its a 5 star place!!!After a gut wrenching morning of working out on an empty stomach and a gym that smelled unusually of roses... me and a very special, good looking, and muscly man friend ( thats right people my first yelp review is also intended to get me laid..) decided to try this place..I dont know about you, but when i think of the Castro i think of thinly sliced deli meats piled into bread so carbohydrate filled, Atkins would probably flip in his grave.... Well not really... but thanks to Ike's Place i certainly changed my views of Castro!First off... Their "dirty sauce" is a gift from heaven. A seriously dirty mind had to have thought of such a pornagraphic sauce that could slather itself so graciously on my bread. How nice they call it an aioli too makes me feel so classy.... Let me digress for a moment to tell you have absolutely awesome the bread was, crusty in all the right places and i have to say, rivals the bread in SOME vietnamese sandwich joints...I wish i could remember what sandwich i had, but it had pastrami and bacon... and we all know that if you add bacon to anything its quite and orgasmic experience... I will definately be back for more... in fact, all this hard work ive been doing to meticulously form this pudgy and shock absorbing body into a leather studded muscle-fest for folsom would be gladly thrown out the window for a dirty sauced anything from this place!!!
I checked out Ike's today because my sister couldn't stop talking about the one in Santa Rosa. I have to admit, it was a pretty damn good sandwich. I will be back!
Good Golly Miss Molly - Ike's sandwiches are lip-smackingly delicious. The clever names of the sandwiches are an indication of how creative the ingredients are. This really is one of the best sandwich places in SF. My fave is the Menage a Trois and not just because I'm a man.
Really tasty, really friendly guy helping me decide what sandwich to get. I got my sandwich with jalapeno poppers and am definitely ready to try adding them to my homemade sandwiches, genius.
DE-FREAKIN-LISH! wow. I dunno what it is about Ike's - maybe they lace their sandwiches with crack? Something amazing happens with every bite! I really want to kiss the person who came up with putting Jalapenos Poppers and Mozzarella Sticks in a sandwich. That's deep fried goodness masked in bread, lettuce and tomato! GENIUS! I have had the Hey There with with Avocado (the cashier called it the home run something or other- sorry, I forget!) Pastrami, Bacon, Avocado on an amazing dutch crunch roll. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The best thing about living in the east bay might just be not living so close to Ikes. I swear I would gain hella weight if I was walking distance from it. Thank you Ikes for an amazing sandwich - I hate you for the weight you potentially can make me gain. =)
It's not "As Good as it Gets," but Ike's deserves 5 stars for its inventiveness. The dirty sauce may not be all it's cracked up to be, but that's especially true because people act like it's the most amazing condiment in the world. It just tastes like aioli. So far, the Paul Ruebens has been the best sandwich I've tried. Wasn't a huge fan of the SF Giants. Although the complex combos are a draw, it seems like simpler may taste better at Ike's.
For some odd reason earlier this Summer I decided to declare Friday as "Sandwich Friday" where I eat a nice sandwich. I turn the decision on the venue and order to my Facebook network. Today they did not disappoint as it gave me the idea to make some sort of certification process and declare a place as Sandwich Friday certified. I would sell out in a second to Subway. My network recommend a place called Ike's Place and the Mario Brothers. If you are in a rush, perhaps to quickly adopt cats (this a joke only I will get) then I would pass but if it is a nice day and you want to be in Sandwich Friday heaven, (the workers said any day could be Sandwich day but that is crazy talk..) They are true sandwich magic people!! One of the best sandwiches I have ever had. Well worth the wait..
After seeing Ike's Place featured on "Man vs. Food," I decided to stop by Ike's on NYE with the sis..sort of a last "sisters only" meal before I left Cali.We stopped by a little after 1pm and waited in line to order. Didn't get our food til about 2ish. I was starving by now and scarfed down my Eli Manning Sandwich on Dutch Crunch.After driving around for parking, waiting in line for over an hour and paying $10 for a sandwich, I would say that it wasn't really worth it in the end. The sandwich was good but not amazing.
IKE and his sandwich shop IKE'S PLACE is the best!!! on 9/13 around 7pm I get word IKE's is shutting down so I status update fb to see if anyone would go with me sure enough my cuzn was willing to go... I get in line at 8:30p and was thinking okay.. I'll get my sandwich around 10:30p go home eat it and have a birthday shot (9/14) at midnight... boy was I wrong, I got my sandwich at 3a so I spent the first three hrs of my bday at IKE's but it was cool cuz I got me a doomsday birthday special c/o IKE.. he is an awesome guy and glad I went. I dont know if the doomsday was extra special cuz it was the last day or cuz it was my birthday or it was naturally just so filling will all of the meats.. bottom line it was AWESOME!!! now I'm glad IKE has partnered up with GREG (lime).. who of my favorite business owners in the castro hands down... GREG has some mean happy hour specials and IKE has some friggin good sandwiches!!!
decided to try it out when a friend recommended to go here for sandwiches. Loved the employees, creative menu, atmosphere. Met and surpassed my expectaions for a chill sandwich place for a fresh delicious meal and friendly environment.
First time here and loved it. I'm a big sandwich guy and this place is amazing. I had the vegan Heath Ledger. Great stuff, highly recommend. Tip: order in-advance over the phone, generally a 20 min wait but well worth it!
This place is absolutely amazing! While the wait was longer than I expected and wanted, it was worth every minute! I went with a couple of friends, so we each ordered our own sandwiches. And i can say everyone enjoyed their sandwiches very much! Each one is so unique and just tastes so good. Their creative names don't hurt either! I will definitely be coming back to try the other sandwiches.Plus, each sandwich comes with a bag of chips and a caramel apple lollipop!
I always saw huge lines outside this place and wondered what the big deal was. My friends raved about Ike's place as the best place for sandwiches, so I figured I'd give it a shot during the week when the madness dies down and I don't have to wait forever for a sandwich.Unfortunately, since I commute from the South Bay, I usually get in around 7.30 or so and Ike's is always about to close. Ike (the owner, I presume) however, was incredibly gracious about it and even gave me HIS OWN SANDWICH because he felt so bad for me. It was chicken, and it was delicious.I've moved to London since then, but the least I can do is write a decent review. Ike is one of my fond San Francisco memories - I'll always love you SF!
I went here because of Man VS Food. Adam did not steer us wrong. I'm going to go a different way with this review. The others can give you "best sandwich ever" "amazing" etc. I agree for sure. What I want to note is the staff. I was there on a weekday holiday with a line going half way down the block. Lots of folks gave up and left but we hung in there for a good 45 minute wait. Normally I would have left BUT I had come 5,000 miles and Adam told me it was worth it (it was)Now back to the staff. Even with this unruly mob, they were the nicest servers I've seen. The place was a MADHOUSE and they smiled, thanked and went out of their way to provide great friendly service. There were a few customers that I wanted to smack - but not these folks. Amazing.
I present the Ike's Paradox:Its a great sandwich, so people wait 30+ minutes to eat one, but although the sandwich is good, its not worth the wait.Explain that one
The only bad things I could say about Ike's Place is the fact that my friends and I had called in an order and they said it would be ready 2 hours later. Too bad the sandwiches were soggy when we ate them. :( Eli Manning + Change + Sometimes a Vegetarian + Nacho Boy + The Joker = food coma & very messy fingers. extra pesto at no extra cost? YES PLEASE!
I didn't even know this was on TV when I first yelped it. I just love eating sandwiches! The line is a tad bit long, but it's definitely worth the wait. They have such a wide selection of sandwiches, including alot of vegetarian & vegan options. My friend & I ordered the Eli Manning & Change and we split. The Eli Manning had "Halal Chicken Breast, Zesty Garlic and Herb Sauce, Mushrooms, Avocado, Cheddar" & it was really good! That is..until i tried Change. Omg...I couldn't really go back to the Eli Manning after that. Haha Change had "Thinly Sliced RibEye Steak, Beer Battered Onion Rings, BBQ, Smoked Gouda." eeekkk! so delicious! The owner personally brings your sandwich to you along with a lollipop for dessert. It was a really good experience!Note: on weekends, they don't serve any sides because it takes too long to cook. Also, if you're planning on eating at home, you should order in first, it'll make your order go faster :)
Ike's Place hands down have the best and most creative sandwiches Ive EVER had. My own mother couldn't make a tastier sandwich than the ones here at Ike's. Ike's has been a local favorite for a while now and has had some troubles recently after the hit show Man vs Food was there, its been sooo crowded there that I guess the neighbors are complaining its too loud. My favorite sandwiches there are the "Spiffy Tiffy" and the "Mission PZ". The meats and veggies there are very fresh, and the bread tastes like it came straight out of the oven. I ha vent tried even half the menu there yet but so far EVERY sandwich ive had there has been AMAZING! The best time to go is during their Happy Hour because you get a free bag of "Dirty" chips and any beverage they have there, that means free JOLT cola in a BOTTLE! Ike's Place doesn't have any seating areas but you can stand up, eat in your car, or your in a gorgeous city....DRIVE AND FIND A BEAUTIFUL PARK TO EAT AT! Def one of the BEST Sandwich shops EVER.
Oh boy. I had high expectations for their sandwiches and I'm still thinking of my meal days later. I chose Name of Girl I'm Dating with tomatoes, lettuce, and onion on dutch crunch and every bite was perfect. The chicken had a nice spice and was super flavorful. The avocado was fresh and plentiful. The sandwich is big; It could feed two. There was a small line but it moved fast. Passed the time waiting by eating the chips that come with the sandwiches. Love this place!
Best sandwiches in town!!! So many options!!! Sometimes it's hard to decide but every time it seems I got just the right one when I sit down and eat. The "Dirty Sauce" is awesome! The workers were super friendly and very swift trying to get my sandwich to me as quickly as possible.  Only down side is be ready to wait especially during the lunch time rush.
Admittedly, I only know of this place because of Man vs. Food, but hey who cares how I found it.So it is in the Castro area which usually means parking is going to be a b*tch...which to my surprise it wasn't too bad.A buddy and I thought we'd give it a try since it looked pretty good on the show and even better on the on-line menu. Kudos for categorizing the menu under "Meats", "Vegetarian", etc. makes it easy.Not to be a poser, but I had to try the Kryptonite (ref MVF). I didn't see it on the on-line menu, but there was the Doomsday sandwich. It looked just as daunting and delicious. We rolled up to the place and found parking almost immediately....woah, that is awesome... things on a good foot. Just for reference, if there isn't parking right there, just down the block is is a whole slew of spots near the middle school. The place doesn't have any seats and in fact you don't even go inside. The hostess/cash register/server (all the same person) is just outside the place and takes your order. The main menu is in the window and there are some supplementary menus next to it. They had samdwiches named after Giants players (Tim Lincecum) and some other cutsey ones like "Not tonight, I got a headache". Cute, but I'm here for the doomsday.We got to the hostess (very nice and friendly girl). My buddy ordered the "Phil er up" which is a BBQ sandwich. I asked for the Doomsday and the Hostess said, "If you're going to get a Doomsday you might as well man up and get the Kryptonite." ---AHEM--- sounds like a challenge to me.... Let's get 'er done then... give me the Kryptonite.This is where the suggestion they make on the website should be taken. Call in your order and pick up your sandwich when it is ready. We got there about 10:45 for an early lunch and we still ended up waiting about 20 minutes with no place to sit and just hanging out with the other patrons on street.The sandwiches came... toasty warm...couldn't wait to bite into it. The second mistake was trying to eat it in the car...no way... it is 4 lbs of protein overload, so wasn't going to happen. Once we got to some place proper to sit and eat, opened it up and it was awesome looking. First bite was a crazy mess, but it was fanatstic. Love at first bite. You really can't bite all of it at once, so you have to attack it systematically. The meat was juicy and flavors blended nicely.My buddy's sandwich was pretty good took. There was just enough sauce without overpowering.I only made it through half the Kryptonite, but guessing the other half would have killed me. A great sandwich to share with another meat lover, but not for the light hearted. Plus the sandwich is like $16...good price for what you get, but pricey. The sandwiches run about 9 bucks a piece, so not dirt cheap, but well worth it. Each is about a foot long with fantastic bread. With the child size (normal) sandwiches you can choose the type of bread...recommend the Dutch crunch. For the Kyrptonite, they choose the freshest bread (aka... specialized bread to fit the gargantuan sized filling). I'm actually going back again today with a colleague of mine to try it out.
Ike's Place is a hole in the wall with delicious sandwiches. I enjoyed the food very much and would've given them 4 stars but...I found a follicle of hair in my sandwich. Not coo. Nonetheless i enjoyed the parts that didn't have any unwanted surprises.
As good as they say. Better. The Best. Days later and I can still taste the "Veggie Not Tonight Honey I Have a Headache" (veggie turkey, veggie bacon, BBQ, smoked gouda, Dutch crunch roll). I'm not even vegetarian, and that sh*t still changed my life.Really. Truly. Best ever.Call ahead.
Matt Cain on Dutch Crunch...Orange Soda...and a bag of Dirty chips.YUM!!!!
Heaven came down to earth in the form of a sandwich shop. Ike was the man put in charge and created Doomsday. Ike's Place has hands down the best sandwiches I have ever eaten in my life. I ordered the popular Mnage  trois and it made me forget that this sandwich was man's creation. My buddy ordered another delicious sandwich, I'll update this when I ask him what it was.We waited for 30 minutes but it was worth the wait. I see myself eating here at least 200+ more times before I leave this earth. The best part was Ike's smile giving us our sandwiches. Keep it up bro.
Ordered a Tony Soprano = Turkey, Ham, Salami, Italian Dressing, Provolone.The highlight of the sandwich is the bread. The sandwich all together was good but not for ten bucks and a 2.5 hour wait. Overall 3.5 stars from me.
Do you want to eat OK sandwiches, or the best sandwiches you've never even imagined?GO TO IKE'S. Wait in a 20 min line to get a sandwich. Trust me. Out of everyone I know, I'm the the least patient, but I would wait even longer if I had to. Nothing compares.If you're really hungry, stop reading now.My favorite sandwich of all time in my 24 years of living is at Ike's called Change.Toasted Dutch crunch, some mayonaissey aioli on one side, warm bbq sauce on the other, thinly sliced succulent brisket, with melted Ghudda cheese and friend onions rings in the middle. Can you believe such a concoction gets fed into your mouth at one time??!!There's an array of other sandwiches just as delicious but I'm loyal to my Change. Thank me later!
Love every sandwich I have tried even the meatless ones. We stopped eating them after awhile and found ourselves craving them lol definitely the best sandwiches EVER!!!!!!!
It just goes to show that almost anything tastes better with dirty sauce and a great sourdough roll - even eggplant!Twice I've order by phone, twice they (or maybe me) heard wrong, twice I couldn't have been happier. Some of the names are so close sounding that either they heard me wrong or I heard the order confirmation wrong over the phone.The meatless mike was the best damn veggie sandwich I've EVER had!! And this was due to an order mix-up, or else I would not have normally tried it.I am not a fan of eggplant, but when ordering a BUD bundy - and them hearing PEG bundy - I decided to try it when they handed it to me. (They did offer to remake my original order and also gave me a free drink and chips - CUSTOMER SERVICE IS INCREDIBLE!) The eggplant is amazing, breaded and I believe fried. It was crispy, savory and totally filling.
AMAZING!I think the amazing thing about this place is that we had our sandwich 3 hours later and it was amazingly good. I can only imagine how it must taste when fresh.We called in our order for pick-up at 6pm: A Menage A Trois cut in three. Got there a little late and when I cluelessly looking around to figure out what to do, the order taker was nice enough to usher me through the doors to wait to be rung up. I got to stand inside the kitchen and it was so cool to watch what goes on behind the doors...though it was also torture to stand and just smell all the deliciousness wafting around. The cashier was super friendly and even threw in an extra lollipop as he ushered be out the door.I'm incredibly excited to begin the journey of going through each of their sandwiches. Side note: a bit pricey. A part of me died a bit when he announced it was $12.68 for the sandwich. But then again, I'm gonna choose to believe that the entrance into the kitchen would normally cost $10.00...leaving my sandwich to be 2.68! :)
I came here quite early (around 11AM on a Thursday) so it wasn't crowded at all. I had the "[Name of Girl I'm Dating]" and was satisfied. I have also tried the "We're Just Friends" at the Ike's Lair (Cupertino location) and enjoyed it more. Nevertheless, a great sandwich once again!
Tons of choices, great every time
Their sandwiches are my favorite. I ordered once for a party, and now keep going there with my GF. recommend to all my friends.
Does anybody really need to write a review for Ike's? Do I even need to write one??Yeah, I do. I grew up eating deli sandwiches all the time. Katz's was a favorite spot of mine, so believe me, I know sandwiches - I am one with the sandwich. I am like Joey from friends except I don't like meatball sandwiches...too soggy for my taste. This place made the best pastrami sandwich I have ever eaten. Order it with the dutch crunch and throw everything including some jalapenos on it. Yes, welcome to cloud 9. I also encourage everyone to write a review because this place NEEDS to stay in business at this location. Show some love and support by telling the employees how much we appreciate their awesome sandwich-making abilities by leaving a comment here. Don't forget to sign your name on the petition!
I continued my sandwich quest at the very popular Ike's Place. It's been featured on the Man vs. Food TV show and in a recent Grub Streetm spread on the Bay Area's top sandwiches. There are always lines outside this place, even on cold rainy days. Waiting in line is never fun, but we decided it was time to take our chances and see what all the fuss has been about.It seems that you are either in the "love love love" category or the disillusioned "meh... overrated for the price and wait" bucket. I say LOVE. OK yes, the waiting is the hardest part, but oh man, the sandwiches are YUMMY. Between the freshest bread baked with their garlicky "dirty sauce" is served a huge stack of fresh ingredients and tasty flavor combinations. We tried the Hella Dirty Bastard -- ham, mozzarella sticks, bacon, extra dirty sauce, and American cheese -- and The Legend of Zelda -- beef meatballs, beer battered zucchini, marinara, and pepper jack. Both were insanely good. This is not diet food and it's a lot of food, so come hungry or ready to split a sandwich.
First off I dont think anyone can complain about their sandwich cos they are HANDS DOWN THE BEST IN THE CITY! The chicken is halah!! Love the lil lollies they throw in with the sandwich However, if you want to complain that the wait is ridiculous by all means!My cousin n I came out here Saturday afternoon prbly not the most ideal time to come... but then when is cos there is alway a line halfway around the block. there is two reasons for this line being so LOOONNNNGGG 1. the food is great2. the cashier loves to talk and take pics and takes his sweet time NO GOOD!!!!!TIP: CALL IN ADVANCE I learned that when i was paying:/ Ike is a really sweet guy the whole team is very hardworking and team oriented!MSG TO IKE CANT WAIT TILL YUR PALO ALTO LOCATION OPENS GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!
After years of driving and walking past the massive line outside of teeny tiny Ike's Place, my husband and I finally got up the nerve to stand in line and see what it was all about. ...........An hour and half later, sunburned with a back ache and scarred from all the nasty looks I received by pedestrian passers-by and neighbors of Ike's, I am satisfied. I am full with a sloppy face and greasy hands. And it was good. I had the Paradise Found and my husband the steak and cheese with wasabi sauce. All on the dutch crunch. AND they sell root beer and Dr. Pepper = yes please!I get it. However, next time I will call ahead at 10:30 and pick up my deliciousness an hour and half later.
Food was FANTASTIC!!! I wish wish wish they could fed ex me another Kryptonite. OMG.. I am dead serious. Only thing we noticed since we have children the new locale was not children friendly. It is a little more hip and young. I would probably take the sandwiches to go next time. My one year old was chowing down on chips and being loud and some of the twenty somethings sitting close by seemed purturbed. Just a heads up. I would go back for sure. Loved it!
I don't need to tell you how amazing this place is - the number of positive reviews speak for themselves. HOWEVER, I wanted to write a review from a gluten-free perspective. Even in a big city like San Francisco, finding a restaurant that serves gluten-free bread, let alone quality gluten-free bread, is hard. I'd tried ordering Ike's over the phone about a month ago on a previous trip to SF, but apparently they stop taking phone orders at 6PM. (Wish they put that on the website...) So this trip, I was determined. I called my order in around 5, and was able to pick it up at 7PM. However, after circling the block once, my compatriot decided to let me out, and keep circling until I was done paying, etc. Even after closing, there were about15 people waiting around for their sandwiches, making me very, very glad that I did call in. My order was ready in 5 minutes, and I was able to enjoy my sandwich (a #65, Jim Rome, and it was DELICIOUS) at Ocean Beach. :)I will definitely try to come back to Ike's next time I'm in SF.
I know Ike's doesn't need another review, but I had to go there.Best sandwich of all time. Ever. Ever ever.I always get The Name of the Girl I'm Dating with Grilled Mushrooms. I called once to get a to-go order and hung up because it went to voicemail. Ike personally called back and apologised that no one answered and took our order. How crazy/awesome is that?
Ate Ike's for the first time and was very pleased. We had a full 45 minute line, so I had some time to checkout their menu on my blackberry. I loved the hundreds of sandwiches and loved their names. After filling out a survey for a 2 for 1 deal - I asked our friendly cashier for a opinion - Menage a Trois it was. I loved it - so flavorful and delicious.The cashier was hillarious and the owner/manager/someone was very personable and shook our hand and thanked us for coming. Although it was 26 bucks for 2 sammys, 2 drinks, and 2 chips - it was well worth it and the wait.There is no where to eat so we took the lunch right up the street to Twin Peaks and had a stellar view of the city. I think we just found a new tradition - Ike's and Twin Peaks - two SF insitutions.
My favorite sandwich spot in the city! One day I was starving and wanted to go to Ike's for lunch, and to my dismay the location on 16th and Sanchez was boarded up. I was like - Damn! What the hell happened?Anyway, it took me a minute to find the new location (hidden within Lime a bar/lounge), but now I know. This place has great selection of unique sandwiches. They all seem like they would be very tasty, but my favorite at the moment is called the Change (138). Two big thumbs up! The only downside(s) is that the line can be rather ridiculous, and parking is few and far between (still 5 stars!). But well worth the wait! I highly recommend!
Phenomenal.....absolutely puts a new standard to sandwich cuisine. Who thought two pieces of bread and meat and veggies would evolve to what we now fortunately have at Ike's. Superman was enough to feed a starving family, meaning it fed me and my girl. I ate probably 75% of it, but boy, that was humungus (that's what she said)...but really, its not the quality of the deli or ingredients, but rather it is the combination they have. It makes me wish I had all those ingredients at home and ate sadnwich every day. The thin cut rib eye steak slices are like no other. And believe me, if you thought that you'd like to go on a diet and start getting into sandwiches, stay the hell away from Ike's because you'll just get even more fatter if you ate here. The sides you can get are jalapeno poppers and mozarella sticks...doesn't that spell out bad for you already?so bad.......yet sooo good.
Ike is the Best. Simple as that. Shame that every damn hipster in a 4 mile radius clogs the place up so much, so I can't get my 'wich anymore with out a 45 minute wait. But Ike and Co. has gotta be making some serious bank, so I cannot begrudge then that -- especially in this economy.
best sandwiches in san francisco
The sandwiches are solidly good tho it is not hard to fine excellent sandwiches practically everywhere. Ikes sandwiches cannot compete with po-boys of New Orleans.
We came here for lunch last week, and though I adore "Nacho Boy," I forced myself to branch out and try "We're JUST Friends". It was, of course, awesome, but I still think I love Nacho Boy a little better. It's just so overwhelming coming here, b/c there are SO MANY delicious options to try, yet it's so easy to get stuck on a favorite. But hey, that's not a bad dilemma...
who doesnt love ike's place?!only down side is the wait in line..
Let me start off by telling you that I am a tough sandwich gal to please...I mean there are TONS of deli's all over and usually they are eh good. You know the type of places you would go back its a sandwich shop after all!I can honestly tell you this may be one of the best sandwich places I have even laid eyes and mouth on! To begin we hit this place on an off hour...right before closing so there was no wait which I recommend hitting this place up on off hours as I hear you can wait quite a long time. So we walked up and they were restocking the beverages outside! This place to warn you is tiny!! Literally its a cash register and a counter. I couldn't believe there were 5 employees stuffed back there, but surprisingly they all were working away and not bumping into each other!!Now down to the food - the sammy I selected was the hot mama huda. And HOT it was!! The sammy was chicken, hot sauce (sort of a buffalo sauce, hot and spicy), ranch and provolone. I had mine on dutch crunch and got the works. All I can tell you is it was love at first bite and 20th bite. The flavor was INSANE! They all worked well and I was craving Ike's the next morning. Filling, cheap and again Insane flavor. I will be planning my next trip to Ike's very soon and yes I would wait 45 min for one of their yummy sammy's any day! Yet another reason I love this city!!!
MOBILE MAMAOk, so we heard this place was getting evicted so we had to experience the glory of ikes before it left the city. Unfortunately, we had to wait in line for 2 hours. We tried calling ahead to preorder but wait time for that was also 2 hours, so we figured we'd just wait in line for a fresh sandwich.OMG so I love SF for soooo many reasons, but def as a vegetarian I feel like there are sooo many options here in the Bay and in SF especially. Ikes falls into that category. NOt only are there delicious meat sandwiches, there is a plethora of vege options. These include all vege or some with meat substitutions. There vegan options too. I got the "sometimes a vegetarian" which was tasty but not really to die for. I'd still eat it everyday if given the chance. And oddly enough, the next day, after sitting in the fridge, it was more tasty than it was fresh. Weird huh? the sandwich that morphs...MOBILE MAMA omgeeee yum! def not as healthy as "sometimes vege" but SO GOOD!!! It had fake chicken with hot sauce and ranch and all the fixins. YUM YUM YUM!!!!My roommate got the "barak" one and the "menagatrois" i spelled that wrong... aaaannnywayshe loved them both but she liked the menage better. both were kinda messy so she wolfed them down just like i did with my mamaI will go again before they get evicted. They are also opening many locations in south bay. I hope they get another location though, please dont leave SF!!!OHHHHH and we met Ike. He walked by us and we were like "is that Ike" so i said, in a whisper"hi ike"he kept walking, so i said"bye ike"AND HE HEARD US... 0_0firs i was embarrassed HAHAHAHAbut he was a really cool guywe talked about business and how successful this flagship issoooo yes, i like ike
I am addicted to Ikes! I have been coming to Ike's every week for the past 4 weeks and I am not tired of it yet! I've been going to the Redwood City location since it is closer to where I live. This is my first time actually coming to the SF location. They have a wider selection of sandwiches but everything on the menu looked so good! My friends and I came around 11ish and thank god the line wasn't too long! Today, I was deciding between two sandwiches, Fat Bastard or the Eli Manning. It came down to the Eli Manning. This had Halal chicken breast, Zesty garlic and herb sauce, avocado, mushrooms, and cheddar. It was AMAZING! I loved every bite of it. The sandwiches here are HUGE and full of flavor from the first bite til the very end. My goal is to try every sandwich on the menu!! Some of the ones to try are:-If I were cute-Pizzle -Flipper -Eli ManningI assure you that Ike's will NOT disappoint!
OH MY GAAAAAAAAAAAWD Y'ALLLLLLLL. SERIOUSLEEEEEEEE.The bread smells like pizza, they offer vegan sandwiches, the bread is toasty, the toppings are delicious and THE BREAD SMELLS LIKE PIZZA! What do they put on it? It's soooooo goood.Had the backstabber and the #2 Philly which they can make vegan. Both were beyond amazing but the backstabber took it a little further beyond. Good thing I live 6 hours away from this place or I'd have to buy a new wedding dress. Oh and they gave us 2 Blow Pops with our order, how cute! The guy even made a point to mention that the lollipops were vegan.My mouth is watering in memory of these sandwiches.
Walking into this place, I couldn't believe the good smells coming out of this shop, it was the best aromatherapy a stomach & nose could ever ask for. I'm glad I came hungry!We got our sandwiches to go, then drove to Land's End and sat down on the ruins of the Sutro Baths to eat them. I ordered the chicken sandwich with mozzarella and Italian sauce on a wheat roll and was oh-so-very pleased when I finally bit into it with a view of the ocean before me, and a friend at my side.
Wait in the long line for their sandwiches! Love, love, love the food. Not cheap for sandwiches, but worth every yummy bite. I had the Love Triangle and my sister had the Nacho Girl. Both excellent! I will be returning every possible chance I get!
I saved the second half of my sandwich for later and when I opened the fridge the next day, it was gone! I only got to experience half of 'The Name of The Girl I'm Dating' sandwich so that warrants another trip to this place.This is a "I saw this on Man Vs. Food and I had to see it' review. I had work in the city and decided to pick some up for dinner.After circling the streets for 20 minutes, I finally got a space and ordered. The girl at the register was nice and allowed me to get the happy hour special (free chips and drink) even though it was past 7pm since I was technically in line by 7pm. I think the only downside is bread choices (DUTCH CRUNCH) get sold out at the end of the day. I didn't get to eat my sandwich til after I trekked back to Hayward so it was a little soggy, but enjoyable nonetheless.Don't forget about their other location in Redwood City!
Mike missed an opportunity to really offer something special to Modesto. Instead we got the same per sized portions from his supplier wsrmed up and delivered to our table. It would have been so great if they actually created something. Can't say it was terrible, can't say I'll be back either.
I've only tried one sandwich here so far... "#86: King Koopa - All Beef Meatballs, Mozzarella Sticks, Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers, Marinara Sauce"All I have to say is thank goodness I split it with my boyfriend because I would have gone into cardiac arrest if I had finished the whole thing on my own. But yummy it was... woulda died a good happy full death.Line wasn't as long as I expected from all that I've heard, but then again, it was raining kind of hard... so there you go... maybe that's the key for when to go lol. Def will go back and try a less artery clogging sandwich soon.
There was no wait at 3:45 on a monday afternoon.And they couldn't have been cooler.Gave me a free sandwich since it was my birthday.Gave a bum a free sandwich just because.Me and my fiance got a Big Meat and a menage de trois. Crap those were good. The dutch crunch bread was killer as well. So much meat. I think a good 2 inches worth. How'd I eat the whole thing?But man, that was good. Ate it on the sidewalk. Walked back to our Union Square hotel to try and burn it off.
Okay, so I had two Menage-a-trois within a week (for the 7x7 food scavenger hunt), but I must have forgotten the kool-aid.The sandwiches were good, but after picking up the sandwiches, in the 10 minutes it took to get back to my office, they were a soggy mess (um, like a menage-a-trois is supposed to be?). I had called ahead and the sandwiches were waiting (this was a bonus). I figured it was my fault for not getting there early enough.Skip ahead a week and try it all over again, this time I arrive early, so I'm there as soon as the sandwich is done.Same result, wet, sloppy mess.Both times, same with my co-workers.Oh well, as long as I can call in my order, I'll be back. Next time trying a different sandwich. Looking forward to a positive update.
Had their veggie turkey and veggie meatball sandwiches. They were amazing. Totally worth it. Perhaps should be listed as $$.
With so many reviews there is not much that I would be able to say. I may be in a small minorty of people who don't like this place, but at best this is a mediocore sandwich. They skimp on the meat and douse the sandwich with their special sauce and then charge $11 for a sandwich that left me hungry when I finished it.
Despite its long lines, Ike's is definitely one of the top sandwich places I've encountered in my 19, almost 20, years on earth.. and I am definitely a sandwich fanatic!Ike's has a really great selection of not only sandwiches, but also bread, cheese, and other toppings, such as their dirty sauce. Their original sandwiches also come with some original names!Sandwiches I have tried and loved include the Eli Manning (Halal Chicken Breast, Zesty Garlic and Herb Sauce, Mushrooms, Avocado, Cheddar) & the Purple B's Veggie CA-BLT (Veggie Bacon, Cheese, Avocado, Lettuce, Tomato).Also a plus: a complimentary bag of Dirty chips & a caramel apple pop with your sandwich order!
I love sandwiches. I could eat sandwiches all day. This place is hilariously awesome. Their sandwiches are named after video games, elected officials, dreams, theories, and whatever else you can conjure up to name a sandwich. I went here during my vegan challenge and they can turn any sandwich vegetarian/vegan. Seriously. They say they can do it, and man they can do it well.They give you an awesome apple lollipop with your sandwich too. How cool is that? Oh yeah, the sandwich with the onion rings = omg.
The line is totally worth the wait! We waited in line for about a half hour. I ordered the Mnage A Trois while my boyfriend got the Tom Brady. Holey Moley. Probably one of the best sandwiches I had during my month long trip out west! Wish there was an Ike's over here in MA.The staff was so extremely nice too :)
Decent sandwiches. But nowhere to eat them, really.
Experience eating an Ike's Sandwich:$9 sandwich called the "Menage a Trois"20 min waitNeeded a beach towel while eatingResult: Simply yummy as i had to watch where my fingers were or i would have experienced unexpected sausages in my sandwichBreakdown: it is a good sandwich and more than a meal (only able to eat half) but i think for the price is it quite a deal. There are far too many "gourmet" sandwich places out there that are charging over $10 for a good sandwich, but Ike's is different and it earns my respect for that.I got the Menage a Trois and a bag of chips and i was pleasantly happy trying to eat and breath at the same time as i proceeded to shove as much of the sandwich in my mouth as humanly possible. My friend looked over in horror and said that i looked like i was auditioning for a fluffer job over at the Armory. (kink.com)Bottom Line: Oh So Yummy, but don't forget the beach towel
GF and I hit up Ike's last Saturday. This was only my 2nd visit and it's been about a year since I was last there. We tried to time it right to beat the rush and I think it worked out. We got there about 11:30 and waited about 25 minutes to order. Then 20 minutes to get our food. After that, it was off to Dolores Park to enjoy our delicious sandwiches in the sun (followed up with some ice-cream from Bi-Rite...another review for another time). I ordered the "change" on french bread. She ordered something with chicken and subbed Frank's Red Hot sauce for pesto which was an awesome decision. Probably not much to say about the sandwiches that hasn't already been said. They were much better than I remembered from the first time. I'd go back any and every day of the week and order something different. Next time, I'm trying the burger. I recommend walking over to Dolores to enjoy your food. For some reason, it's always sunny over there.
This place is amazing. A little expensive and a hassle to finally get your food, but its totally worth it. This place takes so long to get your food ready because they wait to bake their sandwich bread until after you order! Therefore you can expect to spend some serious time waiting in line for your meal. Recommendations: SF GiantsDon't Get:Barry Zito - its pretty bland for a place thats known for their flavor
Let me explain- I am the king of meat analogs. So, all my friends raved about Ike's and insisted that I go as it would certainly become my all-time favorite joint based on the vegan sammiches. I do love sammiches.I was apprehensive as parking didn't sound easy and there is no proper dining area.I finally went mid-day on a Sunday. It isn't far from Delores Park so the dirt hipsters were in full force. The line trailed far out the door. It felt like complete chaos. Oh, would you like a bomb-ass vegan sandwich? Cool. Too bad none of them are on the menu display.After elbowing my way to the front, the cashier was nice enough. He even suggested how I maximize the nomz of my sammich. We muscled in on some table space and I had my sandwich pretty quickly. My friends had a considerably longer wait. (Did we really wait for what seemed like 30min for a fuckin sandwich?)The sharp dressed tiny man who brings out the sandwiches was nice enough to tell us about some new and some upcoming vegan coolness. I dug that.The actual sammich was good. Close to great. I could make one at home but it would take buying too many ingredients and for that Ike scores points. (Am I trippin' or does almost every vegan sandwich contain tomato sauce??)If I could find easy parking, not have to fight my way to the cashier, not have a hella long wait, and get a proper dining area, Ike's would get 5 stars.
3.5-4 stars. I love that they're doing their own thing. This isn't a normal deli sandwich nor probably quite like anything you've had. Most menu items involve shredded chicken with various toppings/sauce combos. The Dutch Crunch and Dirty Sauce is yum. I would go with extra Dirty Sauce next time as my artichoke/chicken sandwich could've benefited from more moisture. It didn't blow my mind, but was interesting and solid. Husband got the popular fried chicken sandwich which was more flavorful and more saucy and I'd say it was better than the artichoke one I had. I'd go back but I'm not freaking out about it. The staff was very friendly. Unfortunately there is no indoor nor outdoor seating available.
I finally made it down to Ike's after reading all the great reviews on Yelp. Every time I thought about heading over to the Castro, I end up talking myself out of it - "the parking is such a pain down there"; "i guess i could take the muni just to get a sandwich", "how good can a sandwich possibly be?".Today, I worked from home and decided it's time to find out what the hype is all about. I have to say, that was a damn good sandwich. Wow. The menu was massive. It was not easy to decide which sandwich to choose for that first Ike's sandwich. If I pick the wrong one, I'll never want to come back again. I will never find out why this place is rated so high.... Luckily, I had plenty of time to go back and forth on which sandwich to try as the line moved very slowly. It took me 15 minutes just to reach the counter (there were only about 10 people in front of me and there were 7 people behind the counter...hmmmm.). I ordered the #2, SF Cheese Steak - thinly sliced beef with vegetables and provolone on French bread. Another 15 minutes went by after I ordered and my sandwich was finally ready. Boy, that was quite a bit of work for a sandwich - 10 minutes of driving, 5 minutes to park and walk (easy parking today), 15 minutes of waiting in line, 15 minutes to get the sandwich after ordering, 10 mins to drive home. That's almost an hour total! This sandwich better be worth it....I took my first bite into the sandwich and thought This Is GOOD... It was a nice mixture of flavors and texture - warm beef, crunchy diced vegetables, melted cheese, slight sourness from the pickles, onions and the gooey Dirty Sauce all nicely mixed together..... It was a lot of work to get this sandwich, the place is a major hole in the wall, and it's not the cheapest sandwich (8.75 with tax) for a place that looks more like a miniature auto-mechanic workshop than a restaurant, but it was a damn good sandwich and I would definitely be back again to try other sandwiches here....
Ok, ever since the episode of Man v. Food aired on the Travel Channel this place just exploded with customers. I came by on a Friday afternoon at 3:30 (yes, it was a late lunch) and the there was a line out the door.I just got back from my trip and was craving a sandwich, luckily I called in my order at 11:30 and they confirmed my sammy be ready at 12:30 at it was ready when I got there at 12:30! I hate to phone in an order of just 1 sandwich, but I couldn't wait over an hour.
Solid sandwich... I have tried a few different once but had the "obama" #108 on my last trip on dutch crunch. It was pretty tasty but the SF Giants might be my one of my favs. Make sure to try the dutch crunch bread though. Its amazing. Long wait usually so I suggest calling ahead and placing your order.
Heaven on Bread!Came here a couple of months ago for my dinner pre-Bay to Breakers. Suffice to say, Ike's has totally destroyed my standards of what a good sandwich is. Thankfully, coming with someone else allowed me to sample a half of each sandwich and after spending 20 minutes looking over the binder of sandwiches we made our decision. The Eli Manning and the Cowboy Curtis. Both were so damn good that I was having trouble deciding on which half to finish first! Great ingredients and served hot!I'm glad that I don't live in SF because I would feel compelled to eat at Ike's everyday to make my way through the menu and be completely broke. I can't wait to come back the next time I am in the City and the Blow-Pop at the end was a great nostalgic treat!
Ike's is AMAZING. The first time I went to Ike's, I ordered a sandwich to go since there was very little seating at Ike's. As my friends and I were walking over to Dolores park, just a few blocks away, I couldn't help but peek my head in the bag and inhale the delicious smell. I was seriously about to drool, but didn't. Ever since that first delicious bite into that Ike's sandwich, I have been looking for an equally delicious sandwich in San Diego and have failed. I have been going though Ike's withdrawal. The best part of Ike's Place is probably that they are EXTREMELY vegetarian friendly. They have many options for vegetarians and any sandwich can be made vegetarian or vegan. The sandwiches are quite big for someone with a normal to smaller appetite. I find it somewhat difficult to finish an entire sandwich by myself. So if you don't tend to eat much, it's best to share, then head over to Bi-Rite Creamery for some homemade ice cream!However, the wait is long, so it's best to call in an order to pick up. Call just as you think you are beginning to feel hungry otherwise you might starve. They seem to be very busy all the time so it can take a while. Amazing food, amazing service, I believe it's as good as it gets.
yang sing restaurant
bomb sandwiches. always go here when I'm in the bay area... I go for the one with chicken, avocado, pesto and mushrooms.
Within the charm of a "little" Sonoran desert town, that is Tucson, is a special secret; Tucson is a sandwich lover's nirvana. Sandwich shops there are as common as corner hair salons in Dallas. Tucsonans know their sandwiches!Some of my Bay Area Alumni fav's from the University of Arizona found IKE's PLACE pretty quickly after it opened, and have now become regulars. The menu (as stated on yelp one thousand plus times before) is diverse and each sandwich whether for carnivores, veggies or vegans is substantial and unique in its own way. In fact, my carnivores often opt for veggie, and my veggie's sometime divert and divulge into the fresh meat sandwiches!Because I live relatively close to Ike's, we take the sandwiches back to be enjoyed in my backyard (or Dolores park) and the sandwiches never become soggy (with the Dutch Crunch roll at least), even with the dirty sauce, or any other naughty toppings you may choose. In fact, they seem to deliver more harmony after melding together for ten minutes or so.Although I keep going back for the meatless mike (note - I have never actually met a "meatless" mike;) something tells me any sandwich I choose, I will not be disappointed.
Every time I go to Ike's, I have to take a look at the extensive menu in the 3-ring binder because they have so many different types of sandwiches that you're bound to fall in love with something new every time. You haven't really eaten a sandwich until you've eaten one with jalapeo poppers or mozzarella sticks on it. Their dirty sauce is amazing, it's less of a condiment and more of a drug. One time I ordered a Super Luigi-- which is meatballs, jalapeo poppers, and marinara sauce-- and it was so stuffed that a meatball literally fell out of my sandwich and into my cup of water, like something out a Carl's Jr. commercial.They also add pesto on request, I think that's really cool. Ike's Place really is delicious, you have to try it. My only complaints are that I don't find that the sandwiches travel very well, and that you typically spend between $9 and $14 for your sandwich (which I certainly wouldn't call the deal of the century). Back to the traveling thing: I like to get my sandwich to go, grab a beer at a nearby liquor store, and find a nice spot to sit down in Dolores Park; I find that by the time I sit down, the sandwich is beginning to get a little soggy already. However, I don't think this makes the sandwich any messier because Ike's sandwiches are already unavoidably messy. Maybe I should just get my beer first next time?I had to mention this also: I brought my friend Kramer to Ike's a couple of times, and he loves it as well now. Recently when he ordered his sandwich, the cashier asked if he wanted everything on it and Kramer replied, "Yeah, why the fuck not?" To which the cashier eagerly replied, "Yeah, that's what we say here all the time. WTFN."The slogan for Ike's Place really should be "WTFN?"
Get the Kryptonite Sandwich. One of the best sandwiches I have ever had. Well worth the cost.
I'm not usually into sandwiches, but I sometimes dream about the Thanksgiving sandwich with turkey, cranberry sauce and siracha. Yes, I am one of the Ike addicts who regularly make the ridiculously complicated trek to Ike's to stand in a long line in the hot sun to pay $10 for a sandwich. It's that good. Enough said.
4300+ Reviews at 4.5 stars? I don't think there's more that needs to be said. Just make sure you call ahead and get your Dirty Sauce!
The cougar is the only sandwich the world ever needs. Enough said.
Pretty good sandwich place, many positive qualities that include pricing and taste. However, as my friend noted, be aware that it is best if you place your order online or over the phone, because the wait can go on for a while if you failed to do so. Overall, definitely a must try place for people visiting area like myself. Even friends from back home who have visited the area recalled this place and recommended it to me. I got the Menage a Trois, which was basically barbecue chicken between two french breads and even though it may sound simple, it was simply delicious and excellently executed. In addition, the brand and bottle of Shirley Temple they had was really good; however, their chips were a little less pleasing. Overall, definitely a hidden treasure since it's in a very remote setting. I recommend though, to get your order and then go to the neighboring park (Dolores Park) to enjoy the day and just soak in the San Francisco culture.
Ike's still rules... let me tell you what happened today... GF and I dropped in for two awesome sandwiches and managed to score one of the tables outside... it was a little dirty, so I zipped back inside to get some napkins... the friendly guy running the register asked if the napkins were to wipe the table, I said yes... and he said not to worry they would send someone out right away... I thought that was really cool. They were extremely busy but another super friendly employee ran out and gave our table a wipe down. Nice people, great service and awesome food!
SPOTTED: Adam Richman of Travel Channel's Man VS Food.Well, sorta. He WAS here though. They had a picture of him eating a sammich because he came earlier in the week.2GOOD2BETRUE.If he was here, then this is my kind of joint, and I was not disappointed. I had a hard time deciding what to get here, but I knew I wanted jalapeno poppers in my sandwich (SRSLY POPPERZ FTW).You can also get mozarella sticks or onion rings... or all of them at once. IT'S YOUR MOVE (time to dddddduel!).I got the "Name of Your Girlfriend" + poppers added. Check out the menu for all their delicious selections. I thought this sandwich was gonna be an abomination, but it was actually a normal sized sandwich. The bread is made fresh here too thumbs up for that!+++SANDWICH CATWALK RATING+ Well constructed and had "THE LOOK."+ Not as messy as I thought, no accidents spilling out.+ Perfect ratio of main meat to side ingredient accessories- Can be easily expensive as a sandwich going over $10- Consuming too many will make you lose that model figureOne of the best sandwiches I've had ever. Someone please come with me soon.
Ever since finally making my way over to Ike's place about a month ago, I've fallen into a nice routine.-Ike's Place at least once a week-Call ahead, and the sandwich is ready when I get there! No waiting.-The ones with the names most awkward to say out loud on a crowded MUNI tend to be the tastiest... Menage a trois. Name of girl I'm dating. We're JUST friends. -Dutch Crunch FTW.The ridiculously friendly service, fantastic array of atypical soft drinks (that ginger ale has some serious punch to it), long hours, and lollipops top off what would already be the best sandwich place ever.How I know I've been transformed by Ike's: On my most recent trip to the East Coast, I didn't even stop at a Potbelly. And how I LOVED Potbelly... but I'll admit it now. Ike's:Potbelly :: Potbelly:Subway.
I loved going to this place before the hype began. You can't go wrong with the halal chicken, ranch cheddar, and the works on Dutch Crunch! Be sure to get the works. We've also gotten the Damon Bruce, Obama, Matt Cain, and a few others I can't remember. Line can get too long if you don't call it in. Parking is a hassle on Dolores but I think it's well worth it. Stop by bi-rite creamery after indulging in that succulent, oozing, mouth-watering sandwich you waited an hour in line for. I don't know how the sandwiches taste now that they are branched out. But from my experience back then, it was darn delicious!
Ike's is amazing I drive over an hour for these sandwiches...only down side is the loooooooong wait but I always call ahead for my order. These sandwiches are one of a kind and you can't get anything like it anywhere!
I love the wide selection of sandwiches and listening to the workers shout out their funny names. Hearing them say, "Mike, here's your Fat Bastard," and "Jo, you ordered the Name of the Girl I'm Dating, right?" makes waiting 30 mins in line bearable. For lunch, I split a Change sandwich (ribeye, onion rings, BBQ sauce, gouda on dutch crunch). It was yummy, but I expected more meat, more filling...Halal meats and add-ins (jalepeno poppers, onion rings, mozarella sticks...) are available.
This place has been one of my favorite sandwhich places when I have a craving for a "hearty" sandwich. I only give it three stars simply because this new location to me is a little too much. The ambience is not like the original SF location therefore you miss that "hole-in-the-wall" feeling. The one plus side is at least now when you call the phone number listed you can actually place an order. I still love the sandwhiches but not a fan of the new location.All in all, if you want a good sandwich, check this place out!
As if this place didn't have enough reviews, here's another one. First off this review would be 3 stars but I give them 4 just for the originality of the sandwich names. With that being said I ordered the [name of a girl I'm dating] sandwich.It was a good sandwich, no complaints ... the chicken was shredded and saucy, their dirty sauce (i think garlic mayo) was a nice touch... and over all a very friendly staff. Would I come here again if I was in the area... probably.... do I fantasize about it when I'm hungry and thinking of a delicious meal... no.
I think Ike's is pretty good. I mean, it's not ridiculous.I had the super sandwich that was way too much food for just half of the sandwich. It did set me back about 20 bucks though.I mean, this place is a nice place for a sandwich, but I'm going to say it's mostly hype. I don't get the lines. Honestly, if you don't ever try one it won't be devastating.It's a nice place to go and try once, but even if it remained open I don't think I'd be a constant customer. G'luck though! I hope you re-open somewhere else.
Wow. Heaven in the form of a sandwich. Waited in a line for about an hour (around 3), but it was soo worth it. Found out you can call in and order for pick up (will do next time).I ordered the Nacho Boy, and the nice gentleman at the register said they were out of avocado so he took of $1 off the price!!! I mentioned how I don't want mayo, and he was like, "Don't worry this is a no-mayo zone" (unless requested of course). I've never been so happy. He then went into extensive detail about the "dirty sauce" and why it kicks mayo's ass (which by the way it totally does). After waiting for a few minutes, my sandwich was brought out by another nice gentlemen who called out my name (as opposed to a ticket number) and personally gave it to me. Found out it was Ike himself! Despite not having an actual sit-in area, Ike's place has extremely awesome service. Personable staff, patient, and friendly.Oh yah, and did I mention their sandwiches are effing delicous?!!! Huge, awesome filling to bread proportions, warm, and slathered in dirty sauce. You hungry yet ? I am, coming back next week.
I'm going to write ANOTHER review about these amazing people.Calling in an order to a EXCESSIVELY busy place like Ikes, should sometimes be annoying, the staff should sometimes be short tempered. HOWEVER.... NEVER HAPPENS AT IKES!!!!! NEVER!!The phone staff is incredible, Bubbly, sweet, taking the time to explain and help you choose from their huge variety, share their secret favorites. Calls ringing, place sounding crowded as all hell in the background. Doesn't matter - They take the time with you, cordially put people on hold briefly, never that long a wait. I have NEVER in my life experienced a staff so over-worked and yet consistently (30+ times now) so happy to help. love love love them!~!!!!! Tips tips tips (and phone #'s LOL)
Hands down the best sandwich place I have every been too! They put their own specialty sauce on every sandwich called dirty sauce, this sauce is just amazing.I split a doomsday and a name of the girl i'm dating with a friend.the doomsday is just huge and has every kind of meat in it. its good, but i wouldn't get it again over some of their more rare sandwiches.[name of the girl i'm dating] was hands down the best sandwich i've had in my entire life.If you come here, be prepared to wait a while in line (45 minutes when I went), but be rested assured this place is worth it. One of the other things I noticed was that the staff is extremely nice, unlike most places which are this busy and are jerks. I kept thinking wow, these people are just so friendly and when I got to the front of the line, I discovered that I went to middle school with the regional manager. Alex and Ike are great guys and i will definitely be hitting up their Redwood Shores location and the Stanford one when it opens in July.
King Koopa, will you marry me? I realize you are a sandwich but you have everything I want in a sandwich:mozarella sticks? meatballs? jalapeno poppers? marinara? What more can a girl ask for? p.s.- I love your dirrrrtyyyy sauce.
Ike's has over 800 reviews . . .so what could I possibly add?I can only say that if you haven't been to Ike's at least once, you need to go. Their sandwiches are something special - made with soul and love. The selection is mind boggling - I suggest taking a look at the on-line menu and getting an idea of what you want - understanding what goes on the sandwiches, what kind of bread you want, etc. When you walk into this teeny tiny little shop you will then again be inundated with hand made signs detailing new sandwich specials. Prepare to change you mind. I still mourn the hasta la vista baby .. even though i can't remember exactly what was in it, it was goooood. My next favorite is the Nacho Boy with jalapenos added. Yes, please. The owner, Ike, is a sweetheart and his mom is, too. She is always willing to make a suggestion when a person steps up to the register and freezes - overwhelmed by options - and it is completely overwhelming!  But just take a deep breath, make a selection and rest assured that you will enjoy your sandwich. The free lollipop with each sandwich is a charming little gift - I once sat at a table outside (there is no seating inside - only a few outdoor tables) and watched a table of insufferable little hipsters dissect their sandwiches, make disparaging remarks and worst yet, when Ike came outside to deliver sandwiches to other tables, most of them handed their lollipops back to him. Um, yeah. Even if you weren't going to eat your lollipop, save it and give it to someone who might enjoy it. Handing those lollipops back to Ike is like not shaking his hand if he offered it to you. Oh ye of skinny jeans, white patent belts, horn rimmed glasses and dirty hair, have you no joy? I don't like Ike. I love Ike.
Great Place for Sandwiches! In person they are great. On the phone not the easiest transaction ,if at all.
I don't like anything dirty, except the dirty sauce!Honestly, it's GOOD... and their menu is witty... so if I could give an extra star for their humor I would.I got the philly cheesesteak and it came out to be better than Buster's in North Beach... now this is one day that I'd never see coming.There is NO place to sit, so we walked around the block and sat at someone's doorstep and enjoyed our sandwiches. Every bite was just as delicious as Ike's menu made it sound like.What a gem in SF.
Okay, it's good. I got sucked into the Yelp hype and headed over to Ike's expecting a life-changing sandwich. So you could say my expectations were high. It was an excellent sandwich. The Dutch crunch roll was just the right amount of bread and there was plenty of filling. I was totally satisfied but I am not sure I would line up for hours for one of these.
I am going with a statement made by many women when describing "being intimate" with me."Good stuff but I've had better."First off, I WILL go back to Ikes and get some other sandwiches. The sandwich I had was excellent but what killed me was the 45 minute wait. I tried calling in when they opened but no one answered. They had a massive amount of catering orders but they let us know before hand so I am not going to hold that against them.If you are looking for a fresh and "crisp" sandwich, go elsewhere. If you are looking for a deliciously "filthy" sandwich, Ike's is your place.Two grown straight men walking around the Castro sucking on the complimentary "after sandwich lollipop" was a site to see. No wonder everyone was so damned friendly.Thanks Ike's.Pressed.
All the hype. All the talk. i HAD to give it a try!! In my head i even thought, how good CAN a sandwich really be?! Worth an hour wait??YES!!!Came here at 1pm on a Saturday and the line or should i say massive crowd turned me off a bit, but i knew i had to try these sandwiches.First off, i love all the names of the sandwiches and all the varieties!I was torn between the pizzle and the al bundy. Went with the cashier's recommendation and ordered the pizzle on a french roll OF COURSE with the dirty sauce!!! He also said to have it with pesto. I love the fact that they toast all their sandwiches!! I would never wait that long for a cold sandwich.Finally heard them call my name and scrambled up so fast to meet the guy with my food!! So packed with flavor!! I love a variety of tastes when i eat, there was so many spices, sauces, veggies and flavors all at once!!!They are a little on the greasy side with all the pesto, dirty sauce, cheese, meat, etc, but im sure they have better options. The bad ones always sound so good though!!!
Ike, you are so good. I wanted to enjoy you today, but when I drove by at 1pm, you had a massive line at your door. My wide-eyed, drool-faced grin quickly transformed in to a weepy, sad droopy-faced frown. There is an evil part of me that wants to give you ONE star, in a jealous desperate attempt to reduce your crowds. But alas, I cannot do such a thing. The trick with Ike's is that you gotta phone-in your order. Check out their site, find the sandwich of your dreams, call them, let 'em know about it, go down there and pick it up. Easy-peasy. And when you do, come back to Yelp and give them an awesome 4 or 5 star rating like they deserve. :)
Thanks to Yelp and all those who gave Ike's Place 5 stars. It was so worth the visit! This makes our first trip to San Fo truly memorable. Menage a Trois and the Dutch Crunch bread are unforgettable! Caution: we had ours take-away 'coz there's hardly any seating.
It seems a little ridiculous to add another 5 star review but they really know what they're doing at Ike's. Get the Tony Soprano or the Elvis Keith.
Love this place.. only complaint is that the food is take out, you can't sit and enjoy your sandwich on the spot. I've tried many different sandwiches here and keep going back to try others, so far they've all tasted great!!
This place is the best because of the amount of variety this shop has to offer.Ikes is the willy wonka of sandwiches.God please dont take this away from me.Im not allowed 5 miles within redwood city so please. Keep ikes alive!!!!
I know Ike's Place get so much hype, but the thing is, IT TOTALLY DESERVES IT! It looks like a small little sandwich shop from the outside, but the lunch lines get long for a reason. First of all, the staff is so friendly. The selection is wonderful. They have something for everyone here. I'm a vegetarian, and I had plenty of options, but there are also a lot of tasty-looking meat sandwiches. The drink selection is great too - they have Leninade! My favorite! The best part, though, was when I got to meet Ike! He's the best! He gave me my sandwich!
Whenever you see a long line outside a restaurant, it makes you wonder if that place is a hidden gem. I believe we've waited for approximately 1.5 hours just for a sandwich, okay maybe three sandwiches but still...by the time we got to the front of the line, I fully regret not calling in my order. The people that come pick up their sandwiches were like VIPs. I cannot stress this enough. Order over the phone!We ordered: 16th and Market, Manage-a-Trois, and "Hella" fat Bastard. Manage-a-Trois was a bit on the sweet side. The sandwiches are awesome because of the special dirty sauce, but the wait made it ehh good. Got to get the sandwiches with dutch crunch and I love the people there, they were really friendly and I even got a picture with Ike himself. They also included a lollipop (caramel apple), so you don't get garlic-y breathe afterwards. So attentive.
My review is strictly based on take-out order service:Last month, my coworkers and I ordered some lunch from Ike's. We had been forewarned that all orders needed to be placed by 11AM for a 1/1:30PM feeding time. To me, that's a bit early for determining which sandwich you want to enjoy but I managed to settle on the Paradise Found which is roughly $9. My sandwich was really delicious but do not expect a "meal deal" - the $9 only covers your sandwich. I would definitely order in again from Ike's but with such an early "last call" for lunch delivery, I would probably look at the menu before breakfast.
I've actually only been here twice but the food is really good from what I've had so far.If you are planning on coming here, make plans to wait, every time I've gone I have had to wait about 30 minutes for 2 sandwichs, but well worth the wait. I'm vegetarian and I had the Vegetarian Super Mario (named the Wario) which is awesome. Veggie meatballs, Marinara, and mozzarella sticks. YUM awesome.Only downsides is the wait and the lack of seating. If you are in a rush, call ahead and place a phone order.
Ike's Place is like making a pilgrimage to the sandwich mecca. It's not particularly close to a BART station and it's in the heart of the Castro. If you're looking to get there, it has to be planned, and it is going to take a large portion of your day to fully enjoy it.Despite such a long journey, there ALWAYS a line outside Ike's, as if this shop was divinely inspired and its messages manifested in the form of DELICIOUS sandwiches. We waited in line for almost two hours before we could place an order because the line really was that ridiculous. My friend Channing decided to tackle the Kryptonite -- which was a sandwich with 18 different ingredients and weighs about 4 pounds. It's $18, but it was unlike anything I have ever seen. From what he tell me, it was one of the best sandwiches he has ever had in his ENTIRE life. "Epic" doesn't even begin to describe this sandwich.I, on the other hand, opted for one of their sandwiches of the month: the "Joan of Arc." It was an awesome sandwich filled with shredded chicken, Ike's famous dirty sauce, Bree, and avocado. It paled in comparison to the Kryptonite but it was delicious in its own right. There isn't ample seating here but there are a lot of parks nearby. We were lucky enough to find an empty table right after ordering, but I wouldn't say that these tables are readily available for all customers. Ike himself will bring out every order and thank you graciously for supporting his business. He's a good man and as my friend Henry says, "I didn't like this place before, but I saw the hustle in his eyes, and I can respect that. Plus the food was great." If you're a sandwich connoisseur and you want to try to experience a place that lives up to its hype, drop by Ike's Place. Just be prepared to wait in a long line of people who share your passion for great sandwiches and are looking to complete their pilgrimage as well.
Line is so long, was over an hour. That was the only downfall. Sandwiches are good, we all ordered something different and had no complaints!
I think the other reviews reflect how incredible Ike's is. I really wish they bottled their dirty sauce, or someone would tell me exactly what is in it. It is not a hot sauce, but may be the one sauce I consider superior to Sriracha which I put on everything. Pointers for newbies, there is no where to sit and eat so plan on taking it to go, Dolores Park is pretty close by if it is a nice day. Also there are a lot more options than those listed on the board at the shop. Check out the website, pick and remember the one you really want so you don't panic and pick your second place because it is listed on the board and you don't want to hold up the line. (Don't, BTW hold up the line, it is annoying, don't be that rookie).I am a big fan of the Tony Soprano and keep meaning to work up enough of an appetite to order the Lex Luther. By far my favorite sandwich spot in the city, it has gotten pricier but I think still worth the price.
This is the place where I had the best sandwich so far. Hands down. There are tons of people that come here for sandwiches. After going to Ike's for the first time, I made sure that I will return each time I visit SF. Nothing will stop me from going here. Matt Cain on dutch crunch is the sandwich that got me hooked instantly. I'm not sure what exactly is the godfather sauce, but I think it should be in every sandwich. All their sandwiches have unique names, or are named after someone. This made my expectations of sandwiches shoot way up. Subway got nothing on this place. Deep inside of me, I wish Ike's have $5 foot long special like subway. Still worth visiting SF and wait for some Ike's!
The Key to Success can be found in a bite of an Ike's Place Sandwich.I'm lying. But their sandwiches are an absolute success. My stomach sure agrees with it.When I heard they had a sandwich named "Eli Manning," I knew I had to take my husband there during our visit in San Francisco (My husband is a huge NY Giants fan).There wasn't a line when we first got there and ordered but as we were waiting to pick up our sandwiches a flood of customers came walking through. It's quite a tiny place. They don't have any tables to sit and hang around out. It's just big enough to just fit its employees. You order at the front door and wait outside.The staff was amazing and super friendly - cracking jokes with you and just being absolutely helpful on finding the right sandwich for you ... really made the customer line enjoyable. My mouth craved for a salmon sandwich so I ordered one that was on their menu (i forget what it's called), but the guy working the register suggested that i might like this new sandwich called "Nacho Girl" (not in their menu). So I took his word for it. .... no words .... There really were no words (and there still isn't) to describe how good this sandwich was! You other reviewers were right, Dirty Sauce = Crack Sauce. It's deliciously addicting. The salmon was seasoned and cooked perfectly, and the cheddar cheese ... salmon + cheddar cheese. Who knew!?Someone drive me to San Francisco right now, please
yummy! I was skeptical at first because my friend said that this was the best sandwich place EVER and I have had some pretty good sandwiches, but it turns out, she was right......BEST SANDWICH EVER!Who cares which one I had, 'cause they all looked amazing!There is a pretty long line, and no place to sit and eat; TO GO sandwiches only.
Let me just say.. I just tried Ike's finally for the first time earlier today and it was amazing. Ok, more than amazing. My boy Kanye couldn't have said it better - "I think I died in an accident 'coz this must be heaven."First of all, I absolutely dread trying to find parking in the city but luckily after making a few circles around the neighborhood blocks, my cousin and I were able to find a spot just a few feet away from Ike's. I swear from the minute we first drove past the place, there was no line at all and no more than 10 minutes later, we were probably fifth or sixth in line. After placing our order, we waited about 20 minutes until a woman walked our order out. The wait was definitely not bad since I was expecting to wait a good hour or two like I've been told. I guess it was just a sign that this was the perfect day for me to finally try Ike's.I ordered the Menage-a-trois while my cousin ordered the Eli Manning, both on dutch crunch. I like how the sandwich also comes with your choice of a bag of Dirty chips. In addition, we ordered two sodas and our total came out to be about $25, which at first seemed somewhat pricey but after that first bite of the Menage-a-trois, it was worth the drive across the bridge and every penny thereafter. I can't even describe the way my tastebuds reacted upon experiencing the magnificence of this sandwich. Their dutch crunch was perfect - not too hard but not too soft or soggy. I could taste the sweetness of the honey along with their special dirty sauce with each bite. I gave the other half of my sandwich to my cousin while she gave me the other half of her Eli Manning. I was a little disappointed with the sandwich but it still good nonetheless. She loved the Menage-a-trois and my best friend made a good point; I probably didn't enjoy the Eli Manning much since the Menage-a-trois is sweeter so having anything after that would not appeal to my screaming tastebuds. My verdict? Of course I will return. Ike's is totally worth driving across the bridge and driving around in circles trying to find parking. I don't think I'd even mind having to stand in line but since I have a pretty good idea of what I'd like to order on my next visit, I'll probably just call my order in ahead of time. That was I get to devour my sandwich way sooner, haha. The savory goodness of Ike's sandwiches definitely change my outlook on any other sandwich I've ever had. I thought I've had a good sandwich but definitely nothing compares to Ike's. If you're tryna make a come up in the sandwich world, watch out 'coz Ike's is taking over.
3 stars folks- yes the sandos are great, bordering on fantastic. However, there is no good reason that any walk in patron should ever have to wait 45 minutes for a sandwich. I get it, you cater a lot of businesses, good for you, but take care of the people who actually decided to walk up to the shop. I understand that noon is a rush, I can tell you why, its called lunch time. If you cannot take walk ins you should honestly close the doors and just be another catering company.seriously good sandwiches though
So I must admit this is only my second time coming to Ikes. The first was at their old location which had to have been at least 6 months ago. I'll talk more on location later; Let's get to the food first.I'm a huge lover of sandwiches. They are possibly my favorite food group. With that said I am giving Ikes at Lime 4 stars because their sandwiches are superb. The first time I was here, I believe I got the Eli Manning (Halal chicken, zesty garlic and herb sauce, mushrooms, avocado and cheddar) all things my taste buds die for! This all combined with Ike's dirty sauce made for one messy sandwich but it was worth it. I was originally planning to take this back to my place to eat but by the time I walked back to my car the aroma from the sandwich was so intoxicating, I had to eat it right in my car.My other friends love Ikes as well, but have informed me that their best sandwiches are the ones with Halal chicken. With that said, I wanted to try a different sandwich but one that still had the chicken. I came back for the second time at the new location and had to try the Mills Viking (Halal chicken, ike's red pesto, ranch and pepperjack). With a little more experience under my belt, I added extra dirty sauce (free of charge!) and avocado. This sandwich was even messier but oh so tasty. I love pesto and Ike's red pesto was a great compliment with the halal chicken. The pepperjack added a small kick and the avocado made me feel like I was getting in some veggies... in summary perfection in a sandwich.Now on to the location. I was bummed that Ike's closed down their first location, but I understand, since they were getting a lot of noise complaints from the neighbors that actually live around there. With that said I really hate their new location at Lime. The small, homey feel to Ikes is now gone with their new location and has made way for a posh club. When I arrived I wasn't even sure I was in the right place as I saw a bouncer at the door. I was relieved to find that I was indeed in the correct location when I spotted the friendly faces of Ike's staff (which i'm happy to know hasn't changed!) The staff is still as awesome and sweet as ever, but really... thumbs down to the location, which is why I cannot give Ikes @ Lime a full 5 star rating.
Our sandwiches, though completely different, tasted alike. The sauces they use cover the taste and are heavy to digest. My boyfriend and I ended up having a stomachache.
This place is like an institution, anyone that visits San Francisco NEEDS to try Ikes.  The sandwhiches are hugeee but the meat is good and the flavors all complement each other.  I've tried a couple of the sandwhiches but my favorite so far is the MILF. My bf loves the superman or something like that.
Since I live literally 2 blocks away from Ike's and it's on the 7x7 100 places list, I have always wanted to try it. Finally last Wednesday was my lucky day! I called at 11:10am and totally expected them to say it wouldn't be ready until 1:30ish. To my surprise, they said it would be by 11:30! Obviously I jumped on the chance and I ordered a Mark Cuban. I got there and of course there was already a line. I went straight to the front and picked up my sandwich all proud of myself. Sucky part was that their credit card machine broke so I couldn't pay by credit. I was short by 50cents and the cashier was super nice about it and said just pay it next time. That's what the extra star is for!Now onto the sandwich itself, I had high expectation because of all the accolades it has received. And to be fair, the sandwich was good, not great. The dutch crunch was fresh and crunchy; the meat was bountiful, and the dirty sauce was tasty. But it was way too greasy. My hands were totally greasy and 5 napkins were not enough. On top of that, maybe because I had Little Luca's in Daly City before, I just don't think it's as original as it is and it costs more than Little Luca's. All in all, 3 stars for the sandwich and 1 extra star for the service. I'd recommend it especially if you have never tried it enough.
I've heard so much about Ikes, literally it's everywhere. Man vs. Food, Yelp, Facebook status updates, Foursquare check ins, everywhere i tell you. Today was that day, the day when you first try these sandwiches. We made the decision immediately after waking up I checked the iPhone and told my girlfriend that yes, we're trying Ike's today. We took a look at the online menu and called the order in at 10:15am, we expected an hour to two hours until our sandwiches were done. Nay i say, 20 minutes. 20 MINUTES! We drove over, picked up the sandwiches and like everyone told me, yes they were delicious. Not end of the world type delicious, i personally think Moruccis is better (yelp.com/biz/moruccis-si) but that's just me. Ike's is what i expected though, a delicious American sandwich that used the freshest and tastiest ingredients. Yes it was great, yes the service was amazing, and yes parking does suck. But, it wasn't the best sandwich i ever had. Don't get me wrong, i'll be back. In fact, i'm severely intrigued by the "Fat Bastard" sandwich, which i will be trying next time. Our order (we're giants fans):-Lincecum (on dutch crunch) [B+]-Barry Z (on dutch crunch) [B][APPROVED]
I have never been a huge fan of sandwiches so I was a little hesitant to go to Ike's and pay $10+ for a sandwich. I always felt that Ike's was just overrated so I never even bothered to go. Boy was I wrongggg.We ordered through the phone an hour before we were planning to head over. We did get there a little late, so our sandwiches were a little soggy. The sandwiches came with chips and a caramel apple lollipop (which i was looking forward to the entire time). I ordered the Menage a Trois on a dutch crunch roll. It's something you just HAVE to order if you ever go to Ike's. It was so delicious and scrumptious. I must admit though, my first bite wasn't too great but after a couple more bites, I couldn't stop eating. Hands down BEST sandwich I have EVER had. One issue that I had was that it was a little messy, the sauce was dripping everywhere but whatever, it was amazing and that's all that matters. I hate having decide what to order tho because everything just sounds soo good...
Vinnie from Alice talked about it on the radio. So, I decided to head on over to Ike's. There menu is big, so I checked it out online before i went. I decided on the 16th and Market with all of the fix ins. Awesome!!! Overall, I had a great experience. I got there right at noon and there was no line. I made my order and waited about 10-15 minutes for it. I got to listen to the dance music and sit on a comfy sofa while I waited. The sandwich tasted great, and I had the Sarsaparilla drink which was a little like root beer. The sandwich was big enough to fill me up and the secret sauce is quite tasty. The staff was nice, friendly and informative. A warning, by the time I left (around 12:45 p.m.) there was a line of about 10-15 people. So, it does get busy.I'm definitely headed back there. Next time, I will try something different and I'll try to bring a friend.
I can't resist! I have to give Ike's Place another review.I took my mom here when she visited me in SF recently. Now, my mom is the biggest tightwad ever, so when I told her about the price of a sandwich at Ike's, she balked. I finally convinced her that it was worth it, and she agreed to try it...only if we split the sandwich (since she was paying). When we finally arrived, absolutely starving, my mom took one look at the place and said, "This is it?!" She was put off by the fact that it was so tiny, and there wasn't really seating available. However, after another fifteen minutes of convincing, we finally ordered the Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian on rye bread. (When I told the cashier my name for our order, he said, "Right! I should know that by now; you come in here often enough." Officially recognized as a regular...one of the proudest moments of my life.)After the usual wait, the guy came out with our sandwich, letting me know that since we were sharing, he had put an extra lollipop in the bag. :) My mom and I each took our halves, and our first bites....It was amazing, as usual...and my mom agreed! She said it was one of the best sandwiches she'd ever had, and she even licked her fingers at the end. (My polite, well-mannered mother licking her fingers?! Unheard of!)Clearly, Ike's Place is a winner as always.
I've seen Ike's featured on Eye on the Bay and have been wanting to go since then. Bout a year ago..My brother and sister in law are in town from Vegas for the long weekend. What a perfect opportunity to go! They've been salivating for Ike's ever since I told them about it and after viewing a few pics and reading reviews on Yelp!We were all newbies but did our research. We knew we'd face a long wait and line but what the hell? LETS DO IT!!!My husband, two children, bro, sis in law, and I make the journey out from Vallejo and brave the cold! Minutes turn into what seems like hours! Our excitement and anticipation kept us warm for the nearly 2 hour wait!!The cashier/order taker was not very friendly nor was she completely forthcoming with drink selection info, but that did not deter us what so ever!! As the line began to die down and closing time neared, she instantly began to warm up to others ordering.Among the 6 of us we ordered a Super Man( this is super big! It was cut into fours and could easily fill four people!), Eli Manning, Pizzle, and SF Hollywood Philly Cheese steak. With two iced teas, two root beers and 5 sandwiches we paid $59.18This is not a dine in type of joint. Not a prob. We were so stoked that we finally got our sandwiches, we practically skipped and held hands on the way back up to the car! We float back to the car, about 2 blocks away and dive right in to the warm crunchy goodness of our sandwiches. MMMMMM! Yummy!!! Where has this been all our lives?! There are no words for the first minute only crunching and munching and oohing and aahing. We are all in complete bliss. The first words are from my brother,"THIS IS SO F***ING GOOD!"We can't wait to go back and try a new heavenly creation of sandwich goodness! My bro and sis in law are already planning their next trip to the City!! TOTALLY WORTH THE WAIT!!
So much hype about Ike's. Came here around 3PM on a Sunday so the wait (to order and for the food) was a total of only 15-20 minutes. If you're a fan of saucy sandwiches, this will be a win for you. I am, so that's why this place rocks. Ordered the famous Menage a Trois sandwich and the Hollywood's SF cheesesteak. I'm a bigger fan of the Menage a Trois since it was saucy and had a slight sweetness to it. The cheesesteak wasn't so bad either but tasted more standard to me. When you order, you also get a free bag of chips (you choose it yourself). Overall, I think it's worth a try because it's pretty good but I don't think I'd wait over 30 minutes for it.
LOVE Ike's sandwiches! I'm not usually a fan of hot sandwiches but the fresh-baked bread and dirty sauce make these delish. My only complaint is that Ike's is so far. I'm in the south bay & have to go to Redwood City or Stanford for the closest Ike's. :( I definitely make it a point to go to Ike's if I'm in the area though. The line can be long so call in your order to avoid the wait.
Damn good sandwiches. I am so jealous of the Castro/Mission residents with Ike's and Bi-Rite, the ultimate foodie duo, in their neighborhood. The small, plain storefront is unassuming, but once you enter you know you've found the gem that is Ike's Sandwiches. The place was packed, and it was an off-hour for eating, about 3pm Friday afternoon. There were only a fraction of the sandwiches listed on their website on the board behind the counter; I got the Paul Reubens, no cheese (no dairy) on dutch crunch, of course. Get the dutch crunch--I was skeptical because the dutch crunch rolls at school were never outstanding, but Ike's bread is absolutely delicious! Perfectly warm and crispy. The whole meal was a delightfully messy, saucy, savory experience. A bit pricey at ~$10 per sandwich, even with the dirty chips and lollipop, but I would definitely come again. I tried to review my order online for a chance to win free sandwiches for a year, but the website calls for some sort of login code that was not given to us, so I'm wondering if they are trying to deter people from winning the deal. The workers are all really nice, though, although as a Cal student I don't understand why they were all wearing "Property of Stanford" t-shirts. Saw Ike himself in a Santa hat in the background. After getting our sandwiches my friend and I walked around the corner to eat on a ledge outside a middle school and one of the workers walked by and shouted, "Is it good?!" and we enthusiastically responded yes in between munches.
For all the hype I had heard on this place I really expected a lot more. I was with a group of 6 and each of us came away feeling that the sandwiches were overpriced and undersized. I can't even say anything positive about the taste or quality, since the only thing that stood out to me was how average it all was. The place has its quirks and own charming personality but the same can said for almost every place in San Francisco. Maybe I'm missing something because I hear great things and the lines are always long, but I probably won't be back
Best sandwich in the City.Sure, sometimes a fancy sandwich at Bi-Rite or Tartine hits the spot. But 95% of the time all I want is Ike's. The wait is a bit long but it's always worth it. I haven't tried every sandwich on the menu (who could, really?), but my favorite so far is the MILF: chicken, red sauce, lettuce, onion, tomato, and...wait for it...jalapeno poppers. They also have happy hours from 4-7pm. Get a sandwich and you get free chips and soda. Pretty sweet deal. Oh, and despite the hipstertastic look of the staff, they're all REALLY nice and fun. Love this place.
Jesus fucking Christ, if you don't visit this place you're a fucking moron.
Forget getting my Ph.D. and helping to solve the education sinkhole we've gotten ourselves into. Forget marrying a man with whom I can spend the rest of my life and who can provide me with tall children. Forget finding a fulfilling and stable job. I have a new goal: Have a sandwich be named after me at Ike's. My BFF was in town, and since we were both teachers on Spring Break, we decided to make an event of sammiches and Dolores Park last Thursday. We ordered the [name of girl I'm dating] and the Jim Rome - both had lots of avocado and were served on hot Dutch Crunch bread. Since we were splitting both, we greatly appreciated the level of customization that Ike's allowed for. Plus points to the tasty "secret french fries" and the complimentary Tootsie Pops. And so without further ado, I present the "Teaching is Only My Day Job" sandwich: halal chicken breast, cheddar, avocado, ranch dressing, and spicy fries (that's right. I want them stuffed right in there). How AWESOME does that sound? Like an instant hangover cure, right? Perfect for all of us who pull the "I'm Only Teaching Until My Great American Novel is Published" card, or even more likely, "I Made a Poor Decision to Get Into Teaching After Graduation and Now I Can Never Escape" card.Ok, Ike's. Ball is in your court. Make that sandwich and you've got yourself a regular customer. And if you don't, well that's fine too. There are about 200 other options I want to try in the meantime.
sandwiches delivered from the gods
The halal chicken is the best! Omg I'm craving it right now!
My GOD this place is AMAZING! I visited a friend not too long ago and insisted that we try this place out (thank you, Man v. Food). We finally got here and saw just how popular this place was. The line was LONG! We waited about an hour before we finally got to the front to order.There are SO many sandwiches that it's almost a good thing we had that long to decide! I got the Eli Manning and it was just delicious. It seriously tasted like a gourmet meal sandwiched between two pieces of DELICIOUS bread!There's not much more to say other than the fact that you MUST make this your go-to place if you are ever visiting the area.
this is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. I've had the nacho boy, change, hollywood, and also barry b. they are all freakin good. the secret is they bake the bread for you when you order the sandwich... so it is FRESH!yummy lollypop free with sandwich, and the service is off the hook. Friendly young staff who actually are nice, will give you suggestions. No hipster slouchy boot attitude here, just damn good sandwiches.
Nice people! Nice serveice!
I know one review among well over two thousand doesn't matter, but I just wanted to contribute by saying this was the best sandwich I've ever had in my entire life (and I consider myself a sandwich snob).I got the Pizzle: light ranch, light cheddar, add pesto, with lettuce, onion and pickles (everything else was as-is) on a sourdough roll. Note: I don't really like ranch, mayo, or cheese, but I LOVED this combo!EAT HERE.
I'm still struggling with this:The sandwich was perfectly awesome, but they managed to fuck up my order completely. I was given practically what I'd ordered, and figured that they got my order wrong. I ordered the sandwich to eat there, and they brought one out to me, calling my name so that I would take it... Five or so bites into it, the manager comes back out to announce, again, that the sandwich for Nathan was ready. I told her that I'd been eating the previous sandwich for Nathan. After some discussion inside, the manager comes back out to tell me that I'd been given the wrong sammy. I told her that the one I was eating was delicious, and no apologies were needed...Then I realized that she had short-changed me. I should've gotten $11.26 back in change and was only given $10.26. She didn't count my change back to me and just gave it to me in a somewhat crumpled wad. I realize that not counting the change at the time would constitute an error on my part...So, with the order being wrong, and the change being off; how should I rate this place? The sandwich I did eat was probably the best sando I've eaten in The City. But the two errors on their part are some rather serious faux pas...
Only the best sandwiches in the bay area
When I found out Ike's Place was moving, I almost cried.Ike's sandwiches are the best sandwiches I've ever had, hands down.I've tried other sandwiches around the area (Little Lucca's, The Yellow Submarine, etc.) but nothing -- and i mean NOTHING -- beats Ike's.I usually get the Barry B. sandwich: bacon, turkey, and swiss. Simple, yet completely satisfying. Anything tastes good on dutch crunch. I am convinced the dirty sauce was sent down from heaven. It doesn't make the sandwich so soggy it's unedible, either. All in all, Ike's is no doubt worth the wait. If you time your visit carefully, you might not even have to wait that long!Bonus: the people who work there incredibly nice and they make the long wait seem significantly less painful!
A mecha for sandwich lovers!!! The line is crazy long, but you know what is at the end of the line ... a massive human creation in the form a sandwich. Over 100 different sandwiches to choose from their menu. The sandwiches are pricey, but then again, no one should be eating here every day .... definitely not healthy for you, but it sure brings a mardi gras party to your mouth :DParking is really limited to street parking.
I split a Menage A Trois sandwich at Lime with my other half and it did not live up to the hype for me. It might have been because I had just had the Roli Roti Porchetta sandwich AND the head cheese sandwich at Gregoire hours prior.. It was a big messy sandwich that I need to try again. My other half loved the sandwich, as he always does.
I'm not one to casually throw out 5 stars. It takes quite a bit to earn one from me. So why does Ike's get one? Because it lived up to land of hype, where very few do.Let's start with the food. We ordered a Manage-a-Trois and The Matt Cain w/ bacon, both on sourdough. The Manage was just a wonderful combination of bright flavors. It might be too sweet for some but I enjoy sweet/savory. Not sure why the Matt Cain was their best selling sandwich. It's solid but not something I'd reorder. They're both extremely messy but that's intentional.Now here's why they get 5 stars. We all know that they get extremely backed up with ridiculous wait times. Well we called a hair before 7 (not knowing they closed then) and they were more than accommodating.  20 minutes later our sandwiches were ready to go. Awesome.
Just sending my support to Ike's Place! I'm stoked you found another venue at Lime to support your community of Ike loving sandwich eaters. Sorry you had to leave your last place, but there's worthless angry jerks like that everywhere and unfortunately you got stuck next to one of them. Their day will come. I'm sure they are just as unhappy without you there.Best Sandwich selections ever! Best sandwiches ever! Just be sure to go on an empty stomach. 1/2 a sandy is enough for me. They are very rich but a must have for anyone living in or visiting SF.
FINALLY, I get to try IKES! I Know it's taken forever and I'm so late on the bandwagon, but I'm def. a fan now! Hearing so many good things about Ike's made me skeptical if it was indeed that good. I was def. not let down. It was that great and I can't wait till I get to try another of their sandwiches!
The World According to Noelle~Allergic Girl's Guide to Life~"Saying- I love you, starts with an Ike's sandwich." Noelle W. It was a warm, sunny and picture perfect Saturday in San Francisco. He called our order into Ike's Place - #85, Super Mario on sourdough which consisted of beef meatballs, mozzarella sticks, marinara sauce; #65, Jim Rome on a Dutch Crunch roll which consisted of turkey, Ike's Red Pesto, avocado, cheddar. It was an hour long wait for our sandwiches. We scored close parking and made our way to Ike's Place. Service was friendly and fast. We took our order to go (just like when we order Rosamund's). He had a cherry cola, I had a cream soda. Both sandwiches were heavenly- made with the freshest and finest ingredients and seasonings! Being a bread-a-holic I can honestly say the bread was out of this world delicious. Everything was allergy friendly. I'm looking forward to trying more of the sandwiches on the menu! I gave up writing Yelp reviews for the 40 days & 40 nights of Lent. I knew my first review post Lent would be a 5 star one- and who could be more deserving than Ike's Place. You've never had a real sandwich until you've eaten at Ike's Place.

great sandwich shop, great drink options, definitely check it out. stopped by on a weekend, and was surprised to be eating a high quality sandwich.
I'm actually drooling as I write this...A friend of ours brought us to this tiny hole in the wall for what he calls "the best fu*#ing sandwiches in the city!" The line was long but so worth the wait! I had the 'Not tonight honey, I have a headache'... drool... bbq chicken breast (I passed on the bacon) with smoked gouda on dutch crunch. The bread is amazing, and whatever that dirty sauce is... it's drool worthy. If you're in the neighborhood, shit if you're in the Bay area, stop at Ike's! You won't be disappointed!
I love this sandwich shop. I found out about it through word of mouth via the blogasphere all the way from California to New Jersey. I had my chance to have Ike's at least twice during my two week stay early January 2010 in NorCal (how I miss thee). The shop is tiny and stands out in the area. The outside is painted a bright blue and the font of the sign is funky yet simple. I likey. It's very tiny. The first time I went there I had no idea what I was doing so I just walked in and immediately I felt like I did something wrong (as if I was in an employees only zone) but no one kicked me out. I don't think people are meant to walk in. You stand outside in a line (it's always busy) and the cashier is outside the door. The selection of sandwiches is ginormous. The first sandwich I ordered was a Nacho Boy on sourdough (Hot roast beef, mushrooms, avocado, swiss for $9). This sandwich was AMAZING. The second time I ordered a Nacho Girl (yes I'm very daring) with the same everything except it had wild salmon instead of roast beef and that was $10. My boyfriend had the Superman ($12 for all the meats in one) on Dutch Crunch. Unfortunately he couldn't finish it. It looked insane. And dutch crunch bread is yummy.The cashier was nice. I think. The first time we went, Ike was there and he personally handed out the orders to waiting customers. I thought that was cool. He's very nice. And they include a free lollipop with each sandwich :) Go to Ike's Place!
These guys definitely know their way around a sandwich. I was in town for the day and I made it a point of stopping in to grab a bite while I had the chance. Not being the kind of guy to go to a place like Ike's and just order a ham and cheese, I opt for the Doomsday. It has a a little bit of every kind of meat I can think of off the top of my head and they throw in some stuffed jalapenos and cheese sticks and put some spicy sauce on it.... I gotta say I wish i had two mouths while I was eating this thing because it was delicious. The staff was friendly and, even though the place was pretty busy, we got our food within about 10-15 minutes. My only real complaint is the fact that there is no place to eat there but they have a deal worked out with Sophie's next door and you can take your sandwich in there to eat it. I'm definitely stopping in here on my next trip.
The line here is really cracking. If you've ever been to L.A. and waited at Pink's hot dogs, be prepared to do the same here. They have a large menu of a lot of specialty sandwiches. They are known for using the dirty sauce and pesto in their sandwiches. I ordered "the pizzle" which consisted of chicken breast, bacon, avocado, with everything on it. I kept hearing about this place and made it a point to go to when I arrived in SF. Definitely a must try if you are a foodie.
Holy S! Ike's has set a new precedence in the world of gourmet sammies! I got really excited when I first read the veggie section of the menu. EVERYTHING sounded amazing and I was ready to get down. Ended up with the vegan breaded chicken, cheddar and BBQ sauce. Oh-em-G that shit was out of control! Soooooo good. Me and the BFF shared it but next time I want my own.....The sandwich was not huge as others have mentioned. Call in your order. The line was about 20 people deep when we arrived on a weekend. Staff was extremely nice. I love this place.
One word! Doomsday = Pwned......sniff next time ...ahhhhh!will not let this sandwich defeat me! =)The wait was not bad at all. Service was great. The staff was very friendly and the little sandwich shop had a nice relaxed vibe.I met Ike today.  He sure knows how to make a great sandwich.  Nice friendly crowd waiting outside.  I just LOVE how Ike comes out himself and talks with people and hands them their sandwiches.Nothing more can be said that hasn't been said already. I bought two sandwiches. I got a doomsday sandwich, was super hungry today  I also got a turkey and bacon sandwich which was simply the best!gave it a 4 star because i didn't like being pwned by the doomsday...bawhaha!  5 star really ^_^
best sandwiches in the city. no contest. just order over the phone or online.
Absolutely delicious, cool little sandwhich spot in san francisco, right next to mission dolores park. The sanwhich I had was packed with meat and sauces, almost overflowing. love at first sight.
Good stuff! Huge sandwiches, sooo filling! I can only eat half at a time. The dirty sauce is delicious! It's this garlic aioli that they bake into the bread and THEN smother on the bread before assembling your sandwich, it's creamier garlicky goodness.Watch out though my sandwich also had a honey poppyseed french sauce which made it a lil greasy combined with the dirty sauce. I think that's the point though. i.e. the DIRTY partThe sandwiches have really fun names as well. Next time I want a Menage a trois ( Turkey, Real Honey, Honey Mustard, BBQ, Swiss, PepperJack, Smoked Gouda) and a Hot Date for Hire ( Turkey, Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers). hahaha. Or maybe I just want to say this to some of the cute staff they have working there.My friend and I both concurred that the guy working the counter/booth was attractive. And since there was a huge line at Ike's, we got to spend the better of 30 minutes discussing his sexuality i.e. I wonder if he's straight? We hoped so.On to the sandwich. Got the Napoleon Complex with Dirty Sauce and the Works: Turkey, Honey Poppy Seed French Sauce, Avocado, Havarti. Deliciousness. It is definitely a hefty, but supremely satisfying sandwich. I see this as being wonderful hangover grub.You must get the sauce if you go!!! FYI: The lines are long. It took us about 30minutes to make our way up to the front and another 5 or 10 to get the sandwiches. So set aside some time to check it out. It's wellllll worth it! (At least you can check out some eye candy while you're waiting in line. My suggestion.)
Ike, you so sexy! Your sandwichs make love to my mouth, and I adore every bit of it!!!
My review is based purely on the food, and since I didn't actually GO to Ike's (I sent my fiance to do my dirty work for me) I can say I am in no way bias.. and that my opinion was not pumped by the crowds of people drooling in line or mesmerized by the wonderfulness wrapped in sandwich form in front of them...well that's what I imagine the scene to look like at Ike's because that's what my reaction was when he brought me my sandwich. Opening up the wrapper was like Christmas morning, the smell seeped through the brown paper! I was scared I'd be disappointed, the "Dirty" sandwich looked like it had all the leftovers from the fridge mounted on top of each other, but this thing was PACKED with flavor. From the butter toasted bread to the sweet tomatoes, and even the peppercinis! The meatballs were on point.And the most beautiful part of it? I wasn't hungry to begin with, but smelling and tasting this thing made me starve for it. It has powers!!!
Went to ike's for the first time today. Called in our order and there was an hour and a half wait, which was to be expected. We picked up our sandwiches and the employees were pretty cool, the price total was about 14 bucks for a sandwich, chips and a 12oz soda. There is no seating, but Dolores park is only a few blocks away. I got a super Mario and it exceeded my expectations. The dirty sauce was incredible. This is the kind of place you go every now and then though because the wait and prices are a bit much, but delicious nonetheless.
Super friendly staff. MAKE SURE you call your sandwich ahead of time. At least 90 minutes ahead of time. Menage a trois - very good. On the first bite, I thought it was ok, but the more I ate the sandwich, the more I enjoyed it. Sweet, tangy, and the chicken is tender. San Francisco Cheesesteak - Good, but not great. It needs more cheese, but there's not shortage of meat in this sandwich.Their chips that I think the sheer number of interesting sounding and combinations of sandwiches warrants me coming back here to try some different ones. The fact that it's pretty close to dolores park makes a planned picnic a pretty easy thing to do.
Alright you got me, I'm pretty amazed.Yes it is what EVERYONE raves about. It was on TV, it has millions of fans, and now I am one of them. Sandwich lovers caution, you might get over joyed at all the selections but you won't be displeased, eat it! :)
Jahbba the hutt himself would get his fatass up to get an ikes sandwich.Its not just toasted..... its toasted with sauce..... brings out insane flavors.
Tips: - Order to advance over the phone so you don't have to wait in a long line- For the bread, get the dutch crunch- Menage a Trois was okay...It was a bit too sweet for my taste- SF Giants was deliciousThe employees here are so nice and actually seem to enjoy work.
I picked up a sandwich from Ike's because a friend had recommended that I try one of their vegan sandwiches, and I must say I wasn't impressed. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, who knows, but it didn't sit well with me. I ordered the Green Goblin (I think that's what it was called or something along those things) to go, and I got it with the vegan steak. I waited about a half an hour just for my sandwich to come. I overheard them talking about setting up for a private party, which may have had something to do with the slow service, but I'm not sure since that was my first time there. My sandwich was basically lettuce, cheese, and bread drenched in BBQ sauce. They hardly put any meat inside of it except for a few small pieces, and the meat had no flavor at all. I know vegan meat isn't as flavorful as real meat in general, but I've had vegan steak from other sandwich places such as Love N Haight and theirs actually has a good taste to it. All in all, I paid for $12 of disappointment. On the plus side, the girl at the cash register was really nice and helpful.
I finally had to try this place after years of walking by and hearing all the hype. I happened to be driving by one day and there was no line - so I took the chance. I have to say it was pretty fantastic for a deli sandwich. But I doubt I would ever wait in those lines. There seems to be a bit of a cult following amongst these 'under 30 hipsters' who seem to be the only ones waiting in the lines. Not quite sure what to make of that...maybe they're the only people who have the time and energy to stand in line for a sandwich.
After living in the Bay Area for 1.5 years, how have I not heard of this place until yesterday?!I had no expectations because I hadn't heard anything about it. But I must say, HANDS DOWN, the best sandwich place I have ever been to. I had the Ex-Girlfriend (chicken breast, honey mustard, avocado, bacon, pepper jack) on dutch crunch. WOW. Who knew a sandwich could taste THAT delicious? I need that dirty sauce in a jar in my fridge.I definitely want to try Jeries' BIG Meat Sandwich next time.
Ike's definitely deserves all the hype. I've been going there now and again since it opened (in the old location) and have never been disappointed. I'm a bit of a traditionalist when it comes to sandwiches (vegan meatballs? um, no thank you) but every sandwich I have tried there has been fantastic. I usually try to go at non-peak hours, but even if it's busy, it's worth the wait. I really have to compliment the staff for staying so friendly and cheerful no matter the circumstances . . . even when those ike's newbies are indecisive and take WAY TOO LONG to order . . . . grrrrr!
Going home for Thanksgiving? Grab the sandwich by that name at Ike's Place and you might not make it. Wow, is that a good sandwich. My son and I walked to this place from the trolley stop. Went from Fisherman's Warf to Ike's via the trolley. How convenient is that! The only strange characteristic I noticed is that there are no tables to sit at. I don't really care about things like that when this place just knocks it out of the park with flavor.
Ike's its friggin delicious! I heard through friends how good they are, but haven't had it for myself till last week. When I had it I was in heaven. But its sad that they closed. Even though Ike's is still within a driving vicinity, it would be nice to have a Ike's here in SF. I think eventually they will put another here in SF, but for right now driving to get an Ike's sandwich is ok, at least there's still a few Ike's within the city limits! It could have been worse and there no Ike's whatsoever! Ike's hopefully you will come back to SF in the near future!
I love this place for the supposedly 200 different sandwiches they have to offer. But my main reason was because of Man vs Food. My recent trip to Ike's was because my boyfriend and I were interested in trying the Kryptonite. That sandwich had almost everything you could think of: turkey, pastrami, onion rings, etc. I was only able to eat 1/4 of that sandwich, but it was damn good. The only thing I'm not a big fan is the amount of greens shoved in the sandwich...but without it, the sandwich would have it's name.I would definitely go back to this place because of the variety. Plus, I never have to wait in a long line on a week day. And the staff are all cool.
The service is HORRIBLE!!! We were there during our lunch hour. Meanwhile 2 hours later. Geesh! Due to the slow as molasses service we received. Note to server: most people who go in during the lunch hour only have an hour to spend. I won't go there anymore! We had to hunt down our server at the end to collect our credit cards. We thought she might have skipped town. The restaurant was only 1/4 full so our service should have been good but it wasn't. They need to let this person go!
Here is the plan of attack....are you ready? FIRST, send some of your friends with your desired sandwich order and wait patiently at home.SECOND, head to the tourist club in Muir Woods with said sandwich in your backpack.LAST, devour said amazingly, awesomely, messy sandwich with a large pitcher of beer while playing Connect Four or Liars Dice.I loved my sandwich and can't wait to go back to this place and try another one. Their menu is enormous and I've heard all the sandwiches are life altering....yes!
Best sandwiches ever. Hands down.Had the Paul Ruben, and it was amazing. Husband had the Joan of Arc (limited time only sandwich) which included avocado, brie cheese, honey, and amazing orgasmic lovelyness.The wait was around 25 min, but it's so worth it. And we were even served by Ike himself.
So, those who don't know wonder: Why the heck wait 1 hour for a sandwich? Hello?! It's not just any sandwich! Was so bummed when these guys and gals were closed because the customer demand so exceeded their old locale's capacity. Recently went back after they re-opened at this new locale. The sandwiches are as tasty as ever, staff remains efficiently friendly, and the new operational lay-out is smoother (plus take-out, so you can call ahead) makes the wait worth it. It's also fun to hang-out to see the wonderful diversity of foodies in this great city our's. Yes, we're all different but we sure do come together for good food!
I just went to SF on a mini vacation and was recommended ike's place. When I got here the line was pretty long but there was a worker there that asked trivia questions for lollipops so he kept us busy for a while. Everyone here is so friendly!!! I got the menage a trois with avocado added, it was sooo good!!!!!!!!! I'm drooling right now just thinking about it. I hope I go to SF soon so I can eat it again!!!
Awesome. The BLT was unbelievable.
Atmosphere: If you like sitting in a club while having lunch this place is for you. I would have preferred a standard lunch/sandwich place. Food: I got the change (Tri-Tip, Onion Rings, Smoked Gouda, BBQ Sauce, Fixins) with Mozzarella sticks and the sandwich was incredible. There was a lot goin on in every bite. I ate the whole thing and I was full for the next 6 hours. If your not that hungry I would share a sandwich as it gets really soggy if you set it aside for later. My girlfriend got a vegetarian sandwich and while she liked it, she wasn't overly impressed.Price: For two sandwiches and two sodas the price was just over 30 dollars. Way too much money for a sandwich! For this reason I might not be back for a while.Service: Shitty. No table service or tap water. The tables were dirty and the people semi-serving forgot to bring us extra dirty sauce after two requests. Overall: I would get this sandwich if I was incredibly stoned and felt like a crazy sandwich with fried mozzarella sticks and tri-tip married together. The tastes going on in there were pretty amazing but for the price and the service I think Ill pass next time and find a easy and cheap deli sandwich. I think this is one of those places you have to try once, and go back when friends are in town.
5 stars for the Matt Cain sandwich on Dutch Crunch. I'm usually not a fan of sandwiches, but this one was unbelievably good. The dirty sauce Cajun sauce is addicting. Can't wait to go back.  Get there early because they get busy very quickly during lunch.
Meatless Mike, Best Sandwich ever! Nuff said
A group of us went on a Wednesday for lunch. We didn't have a problem getting a seat, but a line formed out the door shortly after we were seated. The interior is that of a nightclub (art deco, reminiscent of Miami Beach), which was interesting.To order, you grab a menu, mull over the hundred sandwich choices, and then place your order at the cash register by the front door. All five of us were happy with our selections ("Sometimes I'm a vegetarian","Pride of Castro","Paul Reubens", ..) which were overstuffed with unique topping combinations and very filling. Prices range from $8-$16 and include a bag of chips.We had a great lunch and highly recommend this place.
Searched for a vegan restaurant (looking for a healthy lunch not necessarily vegan) and Ike's popped up. Decided to try it based on a couple of high reviews and location. Saturday at noon so a line of about 50 people waiting to order. The posted menu, outside in window, did not show vegan options. With the help of the order taker, nice young lady originally from New York, I had the Nacho Girl (salmon), hate the name but she recommended it over the salmon burger. Dutch crunch bun (again recommended with a wink) was excellent. I recommend visiting their website and its menu because there are many vegan options and other menu items not posted on the board. Better yet, call in your order and skip the line!
The famous Ike's sandwiches! Very very tasty! I ordered one menage a trios, we're just friends , and another I cannot remember. All on Dutch crunch!Service I've got to say was very good for a fast paced sandwich shop. I'm not from SF and when I called to reorder my sandwiches they actually ask where u were so by the time you pick them up they are fresh and so you have an estimate time . Unfortunately I did not get to try the infamous sauce everyone raves about. It wasn't included in my to go bag :(
My hubbie and I came here on Labor Day for my birthday. Customer service was great as my husband kept being notified on how long it'll take for our order to be ready. We were starving. To smell those sandwiches and to open them up down at Chrissy Fields was just awesome. I had the Nacho Boy Supreme. It was packed full of delicious ingredients. Totally tasty and messy; I was lickin' my fingers in contentment.
Best of the bay??! What a joke. My HOT sandwich was served to me Luke warm and so sauced up I couldn't taste anything else. The bread was okay, but it was soggy and drenched. Not worth the 10 dollars!
I have a sandwich place fetish, and I make sure to try the local favorite in every city I visit. In SF, that meant paying a visit to Ike's. I was fortunate to arrive when I did (about 10:40am), because apparently people eating lunch at a NORMAL time often face 30-40 minute waits. But, after eating/devouring my sandwich (Nacho Boy with Dutch Crunch bread, turkey and sriracha), I can't wait to return again and wait with them. A sandwich seems easy, something anyone can make at home. But somehow in all of my sandwich tinkering I have never created a sandwich as amazing as that one. And they have hundreds more! I wish we had Ike's in Atlanta, but I may just have to move to the Bay to get my fix. Thanks Quetzal and the Ike's team for a mindblowing lunch!
This place is just on another planet. The usual sandwich and lunch places can't touch anything going on here. Call ahead or get there early. And even if you do that, be prepared to wait a bit. Don't come here on your lunch hour. Do it on a lazy Sunday or when you aren't pressed for time. You'll be in a food coma afterwards anyway...
In a word, Hype. I finally broke down and bought food here. I had stopped in once but didn't feel like waiting for a sandwich. The girl taking orders was just as pleasant as can be. The sandwich, not as pleasant. I had the meatless meatball sandwich and changed the pepper jack for provolone cheese. They seem to want to put pepper jack in many of their sandwiches, no big deal, but I hate it. Back to the sandwich. First thing is that they made it wrong and came out to tell me and ask me if I still wanted it as they made it, which I didn't. So they said they would fix it quickly. Fine, no problem, people make mistakes. Took the sandwich to go, as there is nowhere to really sit to eat here. That's just the way it is, no points lost for this fact. But big points lost for a $10 sandwich that is quite meagerly filled leaving me still hungry. "Where's the (veggie) beef?! The fake meat had decent flavor, but was almost non-existent to enjoy. In fact, about a third of the sandwich was void of it altogether. The part where it existed was pretty thinly laid on the sandwich. The sandwich was pretty much goopy overall.I had a sandwich at Safeway a few days later that cost $4.99 and it was more than twice the sandwich. Granted the woman who made it was more or less a zombie, but I'm not taking her home, only the sandwich.I just don't get the hype. If a sandwich is going to cost more than a big ole burrito then fill it up like one. Nothing like blowing money and not even being close to full. I will say that they try to have an abundance of interesting options, but it boils down to the execution, which was in a word, Fail. Maybe I got the dud that day, or maybe that's how it is, but first impressions often mark the bar. If it was a first date, I highly doubt there would be a second one.They do have some interesting drink choices.
A friend brought me here, and we shared a sandwich for just $11. Menage a trois on dutch crunch is most definitely the best sandwich I've had in my life. The flavors are very fresh and even I (a person who doesn't like sandwiches in general) really like it.
Ike's is by far the best sandwich i've had in my life, with jay's cheesesteak coming in second, and garden grill in providence, a close third ( if you curious ) they are super veggie and vegan friendly, and just friendly in general, i made up my own sandwich up which Ike promptly named ( the "Veggie 49er" fake turkey+smoked gouda+honey mustard+hot sauce) ask for it by name!The sandwiches take almost forever to make, which is ok when the weather is nice, but kind sucks if its rainy or cold out, since there really isn't an "inside" to wait in, but if you call ahead they will schedule a sandwich pickup time for you in 30-50 mins. which while it sounds crazy, is really ok once you take your first bite.
i live in LA and i still crave for more ikes!there is nothing more to say its taste good, its priced good, its portioned good. no tables? no problem! i eat ikes anywhere.
Why add review 1009? I like Ike's. I am not sure when the last time I laughed while reviewing an on-line sammich menu. That plus the positive 1005 reviews (there's a few non Ike's believers) tempted me on a sunny sunday to try something new. Their system is down pat, if you can get thru on the phones they give you a pick-up time. You'll get there and there will be a line but don't fret, they'll call your name and you go right to front and pay and pick-up. The caramel apple lolly was a nice touch ! Just suck don't bite, (that's what he said),
Went here for the first time with my friends today. This place is more or less oriented towards the SF Giants (yayyyy! Go Giants). The workers are very friendly and they provide good service. The sandwhiches are delicious and have interesting names, some including baseball players from the SF Giants. My friends and I ordered the Matt Cain sandwhich, and I split the sandwhich with one of my friends. The sandwhich contains several types of meat like salami, roast beef, and turkey. The sandwhich in size is pretty big and easily made me and my friend launch into a happy food coma, even when we split the sandwhich in half. The interior design is pretty cool. It fits a club scene or a party scene. Great place! Would come here again!
Whaaaaat? 4 stars only? Hang on a sec let me explain.I made the trek out here after dropping off a couple friends at zee airport. Considering I took advantage of the carpool lane to cross the San Mateo bridge, I decided to make the most of my time on the other side of the bay. After reading reviews, I placed my order on the phone as soon as I left the airport, since it would take awhile for my sandwich to be made. I'd highly recommend doing this too, but also know what's on the menu since there's a bunch of specialty sandwiches. So after travelling an additional 20 minutes from the airport, I found parking nearby, and noticed it wasn't that busy from the outside. Little did I know that this place was really small. Seriously the register is 2 steps away from the front door. There were a good 5-7 people waiting for their sandwiches too, thus increasing my wait time by another 10 minutes. That ladies and gentlemen is one of the reasons why it went down 4 stars.Another reason why is because they didn't have any roast beef since I wanted to order the nacho boy. Yeah, they ran out of roast beef, salami, and burger patties at 6pm. Bummer. I ended up ordering a regular pastrami sandwich with avocado on dutch crunch. On the plus side, I happened to come during their happy hour, in which I got free chips and a drink. I finally got my sandwich and took it to my car. Since i wanted to try it while its still hot, I opted to take a bite, which eventually turned into 2 bites, which eventually turned into 3. Moments later, I had devoured half of my sandwich. Looks like Adam from Man Vs. Food knew why he went. The sandwich was delicious! All the ingredients blend well without overtaking each other in taste. I also found out they don't bake your bread until you order it. Worth the wait! It's not as big as a sandwich a Little Lucca's and it can be slightly more expensive depending on what you order, but the toasted bread gives it the advantage over Lucca's (still got love for them though).I am definitely coming back here again, hopefully during another happy hour. I look to bump it to 5 stars next time. Mmmm. BTW, they take credit card.
Tried the "Joker" today. Meatball sub with red pesto and green zucchini. I made noises like Meg Ryan in "When Harry Met Sally".
Ah Damn! One of THE best sandwiches you could have. Friendly staff, great service... just know they are hella busy so dont be surprised if you try to be "smart" and call in your order, only for their staff to tell you to pick up your sandwich in two hours. Now for the sandwich I always have... I had the best date I've ever been on - when I ordered a Hot Date on Crunch from Ike's. Cheap date it was AND I didn't have to be witty or charming. I'll be back...
Tiny little sandwhich shop located in the heart of the Mission/Castro.Goodluck deciding what sandwhich because there were so many different combinations of sanwhiches plastered all over the wall. I thought it a clusterfuck and spent way too much time searching for the right sandwhich.The good news is that the employees were super nice and helpful. The lady suggested a few sandwhiches based on what type of meat I wanted.After all said and done, I opted for the "Curtis," sandwhich 10 off the sandwhich board list. The Curtis had some type of marinated chicken and your normal condiments. I must say this was one of the best sandwhiches I have ever eaten. A little on the pricey side, but worth the quality it provides. I took away a star due to the hard to read/unorganized sandwhich board.
It's walking distance from my house, but I've never gone out that way until this afternoon when my roommate and I decided we wanted a good sammich. Little did we know how freaking good the sammiches would be. I got the "Change" sammich. Thin bits of steak, gouda or havarti i can't remember, beer battered onions, bbq sauce on a dutch crunch roll. And a Leninade to guzzle down on.Like a true American.My roommate got the Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian sammich and she aboslutely loved it.We were given excellent service and plenty of advice about the menu from all those who work there! It's a small space inside so at least be warned about that. I'm coming back here, a lot.
Supreme sandwiches. And the new spot (in the old Joseph Schmidt space) means no more long waits. The wait is just as long as it takes to make one of those oh-so-yummy sandwich concoctions.
5 stars well deserved... The dutch crunch bread and the dirty sauce make for amazing tasty sandwiches!!!
My husband and I saw this place on Man VS Food, and I have to admit I was thinking what can they do to a sandwich to make it soooo great?!?!We had a chance to stop by whenook our niece to Mission Dolores. It was close but it was cold so we drove. We parked across the street expecting a crazy long line, it wasn't bad. There wasn't much seating but we expected that. Our total wait was only about 15 minutes. The guy and girl working the register were really friendly and helpful, offering advice on whats good and helping us decide. My husband ordered the "superman" my nice who is 9 ordered the tuna and I ordered the "Menage a trois". My husbands sandwich was seriously so heavy I thought it was going to break through the bag. We got them in the car and went to find a spot in the park to picnic. Unfortunately the smell was so overwhelming we never found a spot we pulled over and sat in our car and ate. Mine was amazing! My husband who takes pride in his eating skills couldn't finish his sandwich. My niece didn't love her tuna, I tried it and it was really good, It just wasn't kid friendly.(Or maybe she just wanted the sucker) I don't know if they had a kids menu.. I probably should have steered her towards that. I cant explain how yummy these sandwiches were. My only complaint... they aren't closer to where we live!
probably some of the best sandwiches in the bay! so many options theyll have u hooked. Excellent Service! Dont be afraid to experiment with their sandwiches because they are awesome.
Delicious sandwiches! Service was amazing. We ordered our food to go, and they gave us a very realistic time and honored it. Will be coming back for more! Just tooo many good options!
Ike's doesn't need any more five star reviews.. except.. well.. it does, because it's worth it.Sandwiches are consistently delicious and endlessly customisable. Service is always very friendly, helpful and accommodating. Literally the only drawback is the popularity - meaning, the wait, and nowhere to sit and eat - but that can be worked around with a little planning. I'm also not a huge fan of the chips they give you, but as soon as the sandwich arrives you'll forget all about them.To do Ike's like a pro:- order sandwich in advance online/by phone- rock up at Ike's, pick up sandwich and dance brief jig of delight- saunter knowingly one block downhill on 16th to Cafe Sophie- buy an excellent coffee, have a seat and enjoy- profit
Sandwiches with the Dirty Sauce are a must for a Saturday Afternoon football session! First time we went here, we brought these sandwiches into the Giants game. They were a little soggy, but still really tasty. I could only imagine how these would have tasted right out of the toaster. I had the Nacho Boy Supreme.. It had all the fixings with a healthy slab of meat. My friend got the meatball sandwich and we did the ol swicharoo with the second half of our respective sandwiches. I loved them both. My friend was disappointed with his Barry Zito sandwich.. but with a name like that... who wouldn't be?*nom nom*
Dear Ike's,I love your meat. This is big considering I'm veggie 95% of the time. But for your meat, exceptions are made.Pizzle, oh! pizzle, when you're headed to my mouth I almost drool.Hot Momma with your Frank's Hot sauce...oh god, you get me all worked up. You're hot and messy and I love it.All three hundred other sandwiches on the menu, don't you worry, your time is coming.I love the way my sandwich is ready right when you say it will be. I love the way my sandwich is so big, I usually don't eat the whole thing at once. (again, there are exceptions)I love your big meaty sandwich outside, up above, hovering over me like a Giant Guardian Sando.Ike's, I love your meat.Much Swooning (and raving to everyone who'll listen),Emily...but you can call me Teets cuz we're boys
Two things about Ike's:- They can make all of their sandwiches vegetarian (and most vegan).- It will be the best sandwiches you've ever had.
Went here for the first time to pick up some sandwiches to sneak into the movie theater.I ordered the Thanksgiving and my boyfriend ordered the Say Hey. Both were delicious! The bread was nicely toasted and the condiments were of good quality. I can't wait to try their other sandwiches.
The best sandwich I've ever had in my life, I got from Ike's. Next time I'm in San Francisco this place sure gets another visit from me.
I wish I could give less than one star.Getting customers orders wrong is a pretty basic example of bad customer service.Selling inedible, smelly sandwiches is a pretty basic example of bad hygiene. I bought a sandwich yesterday, paying $10.84. I asked for chicken breast with no cheese. The guy suggested some kind of honey barbecue sauce, I said no thanks, and I know the guy heard me because he was clearly so surprised at the idea of someone not wanting cheese and honey barbecue sauce.The sandwich came with both cheese and some disgusting sauce (presumably honey barbecue) and, more worryingly, had a really unpleasant rancid smell, like they had fried the chicken breast in old stale oil that was way overdue for changing. Or maybe they had left the cheese or the sauce out of the fridge too long. I don't know, but sandwiches shouldn't smell like that. Their staff had written 'COR-EEPY CHICKEN' on the sandwich wrapper. At first, I assumed the intent was to insult me rather than to accurately describe their smelly, inedible sandwich until I found out, no, the coreepy chicken is actually a 'secret' menu item. Over-hyped, insanitary, inedible. Ikes? Ick.
I didn't know about Ike's until a girlfriend of mine told me about it. We finally gave it a try the other day. I knew that we were going to wait for awhile, but wasn't sure how long we were going to wait. By the time we got to the register, we had waited at least an hour and an additional 15 minutes for our sandwiches. But it was defintely worth the wait. Great customer service and we will be back for more!!!
Ok, so being the sandwich connoisseur that I am, I finally made it out to Ike's Place yesterday and it was "all that and a bag of chips" (figure of speech - I didn't actually have room in my stomach for chips).There were so many sandwiches I wanted to try that I just couldn't make up my mind. Thanks to the super friendly and helpful staff I finally decided on the #59 "The Cristina and Umair Go to Ike's Place". It's a smorgasbord of fresh meats and veggies (Turkey, Bacon, Ham, Salami, Italian Dressing, Avocado & Provolone) ...ok, maybe not so many veggies after all, but whatever?Most def one of the best sandwiches I've had. It was all like... all gourmet n' shit!!!UPDATE: I've retired the Barry B. and the Matt Cain is my current fave sandwich from here.
All the reviews are accurate. Best and most addictive sandwiches ever. I had the crazy corey off the veg menu (I think that's the name).. it's faux chicken infused with Chinese mandarin oranges with dirty sauce (19+ herbs and aioli baked in the bread), with sauteed red onion, lettuce, tomato and avocado. Free chips with the order and a nice caramel green apple lolly pop that leaves Ikes memorable with every lick. This sandwich was so good, I ate as slow as possible to preserve the experience. Definitely glad I don't live in the Mission, this place would suck the my financial situation dry.
Ikes makes a decent sandwich, has marketed itself very well and gets props for plenty of vegan options -- for that it gets 3 stars --- but I've found myself avoiding the place on account of it being a bit on the expensive side, those astonishingly long wait times everyone keeps mentioning. When the business first opened you could always walk right in, find a place to eat at a sidewalk table --- now its a circus.I wish Ike's the best and hope they find a new space, but it's not worth the wait --- with the convenience factor of eating-out gone why not make a great sandwich at home? you can do so in less time and for less money even if you go all-out with top-shelf ingredients from the farmers market and grocery store.
Sandwiches were incredible. 1 hour wait was not.
6 STARS! My absolutely favorite sandwich place ever! This place is phenomenal. I look forward to going every time I'm in San Fran! Long lines but well worth the wait!
Sandwich shops... mmmm... I have to pat myself on the back since I know I can make a mean sandwich at home when I feel like it. But that's always the kicker, I'm too friggin lazy to do it most of the time! Plus, I should not participate in our so called recession. I'm going to stand up and fight against it by spending some dinero on local businesses.Hit up this little semi-hole in the wall joint late Sunday afternoon. After a playing a morning and afternoon of organized basketball league games in an attempt to get my calorie burning machine up and running, my body was a bit sick and tired of eating bananas and Clif bars. A friend recommended we take a short 2 block walk and find this little gem plus I haven't been spending time with them lately so it was great to walk and chat about how us early 30s guys can still kick some ass on the court.They had quite a selection of specialty sandwiches, all of which I don't remember since I craved only one thing, a nice juicy hot pastrami sandwich. Once I zeroed in on that, my tunnel vision mind began to dream of what lays ahead. Here's my check list for key attributes that make a great sandwich shop.Customers waiting outside overflowing to the sidewalk - CheckCustomer sitting outside eating having the expression "Don't bother me" - CheckLightly toasted French bread/roll - CheckThick slices of genuine pastrimi - CheckFresh ingredients - CheckCute female order taker with a British accent - CheckEverything looked good far and once I dove into the potentially 900 calorie sandwich, I was swimming in the scrumptious delight. I could find a reason to make my way back to Ike's Place for sure plus they had something I've never seen before... a glass bottle of Jolt Cola... weren't those things outlawed?!?I'm certain this place deserves a 5 star rating, but I'll need to test my taste buds a few more times here before upgrading.
I wanted to wait and be the 1000th reviewer but I missed it by 2! Oh well. There should be a limit on the number of reviews for a sandwich shop. Yelp should cap the review at 1000 and give the 1000th reviewer a free sandwich or something.Anyways.... succumbed to the hype. Wanted to check it out. Nice little sandwich place. Called ahead order was ready when they said it would be (15 min on a Sat afternoon). 6-8 people in line. Walked right up when I said I had a phone order (that's right head of the line baby). Picked up my sandwich (Jim Rome #65 with jalapeno and mustard, light on the dirty) .Hmmm. Bag is a good weight. Sandwich was yummy and hot. Bread was toasted and soft. Got a nice kick from the jalapeno or maybe the red pesto and dirty sauce. Who knows and who cares. Perfect. Little bit on the oily side for a sandwich but good. Packs a good dent in your stomach. Definitely full. Didn't care much for the candy. Some people like it but I can do without the sugar. $8 for a sandwich. Decent. Not a steal. Little pricey but its SF city.Tips: Phone ahead. Check out the on-line menu way more options than the in store menu.Enjoy.
I had the "We're JUST Friends" with avocado, sweet orange glaze, pepper jack, halal chicken. It was halal-good :)
Are these sandwiches good...you bet your bottom they are. I can't go as far as to say they are the best and up to the HYPE built, but worth it nonetheless. I got the "Hey ya" - Meat, dutch crunch, sauce, nice vegetables and you can't go wrong. The menus is large and so many different sandwiches that it gets a bit overwhelming because you don't want to miss out. It'd be nice if they consolidated everything on to one menu instead of signs in random places. Everyone here reviews about the sandwiches, but I gotta give props to Ike himself and his down to basic business practice of individually greeting and hand delivering each customer their sandwich. He confirms it is their order and gives a big thank you. That's a rare thing these days.
What a gem! Found this place walking along the triangle. Long lines, must be good. We were totally right. Sandwiches are very unique and interesting. The only problem was there were too many to choose from! We don't remember what we had, but it was vegetarian and it was very yummy! Not really for dining in, although there were literally 1 or 2 tables which was quickly surrounded by a slew of people waiting for their orders. Our order did take quite a bit, it was prime time. Will definitely come back to this place again.
Tripping sandwich trippin that is! Man i have been on an IKE diet or something every week for the last 3 months i have had a sandwich to go and if all else fails i get one delivered to anyone venturing out that way! Yes how i heart you IKE thank you so much you make being a sandwich lover that much easier! Joan of Arc is my obsession
I had a sandwich that is number 5 of on a list of about 190 different ways of putting deliciousness between two slices of bread. Now if you add all the possible combinations of condiments, bread,and any other additions or substitutions, I think that means Ike's provides you with about 100 billion choices. I had the "Nacho Boy" which is Hot Roast Beef, Mushrooms, Avocado, and Swiss. Why is it called the Nacho Boy, you ask? What do any of those ingrediants have to do with Nachos? Or Boys?I have no clue, and I have to tell you, I don't care, because it was amazingly delicious, and if he wants to call it Nacho Boy, that's ok with me.
Can't go wrong with Ikes' sandwiches. Just a heads up: not all the vegan entries listed on the website menu are available (e.g. vegan steak).
Made the trip to Ike's on our first day in San Fran great sandwich. If you are traveling by foot the is no place to sit and eat. And the city does not believe in benches for the public.
#108 Do you smell what Barak is cooking?(Thinly Sliced RibEye Steak, BBQ, Smoked Gouda, Price: $9.99)Everything on Dutch Crunchand Jalapeno Dirty Chips ^_^Really messy but AMAZING!I've tried a few other sandwiches but this was my favorite so far... here is the menu:ilikeikesplace.com/menuThe line at Ike's original place was never really an issue for me and I was really sad when I found out it was closing. But WAIT IKE'S @LIME! So close to his original location and not as long of a line... perfect! I usually just wait but i decided I would call in, I drove from my place in the sunset down to market, and waited only three minutes for again another delicious sandwich. I do miss his old location cause the atmosphere just fit better (although there is seating now) but having a place at all is something to be happy about. Now I'm just hoping for even better news that Ike's gets the place at SF state! I would be broke, but very full, and very happy!For Now... go check out Ike's @ Lime
went here after a trip to the marin headlands and decided ike's place as our late lunch fare in the city. ordered the damon bruce and spiffy tiffy in a french sourdough roll, added mozzarella sticks in the spiffy tiffy and banana peppers in the damon bruce. the dirty sauce is out of this world. my mouth is watering as we speak! my favorite so far is the damon bruce which comes with rib-eye, bbq sauce, onion rings and cheddar! damn, i'm definitely back on the road for this sandwich delight! when we arrived, there wasn't any long lines to greet us. it took for a 10 minute wait for our orders. yeayuh!
Not much for me to say that hasn't already said. But basically...Ike's is everything a hole-in-the-wall sandwich stop should be. Most sandwiches can only aspire to be as good as what you get here.Bottom Line: Get offline and go. Ideally, you should call ahead of time to place your order so you don't have to wait in line. (Although waiting in line there is still worth it)If you can't do that just yet, ponder these perks:-In a fun, friendly neighborhood-The staff is ever-bubbly and friendly-Happy Hour is on Tuesdays; this means you get a free soda (you can choose from an awesome assortment of local brands which have flavors like Mojito and Chocolate Chai) and chips-They have a sandwich called "Insert your favorite Sesame Street character"...and thats not the actual NAME of the sandwich; you literally have to call it your favorite Sesame Street character (i.e. "I'll have the Elmo on sourdough")-The Dutch Crunch bread is scrumptious-Two words: DIrty Sauce.-Cool extras like Brie and real honey. Endless possibilities!-Very considerate special diets: nobody is excluded at Ikes, where they have options for vegans, vegetarians, and Halal-only meat lovers!
Poopooo, pooo, pooo---ooookkkaaa, face! nananananana.... Sorry - that wasn't part of the review although a friend and I were singing that song while chowing down at Ike's!Believe the hype. But it's not hype of it's true, right? This is the real deal. I had the Nacho boy and I'm not exactly sure why it's called nacho boy (roast beef heaven), but it could have been called POS sandwich and I'd still enjoy it. No joke.I though the workers there were very awesome and friendly. Service was fantastic for more or less a take-out sandwich joint..everyone was smiling and talking amongst each other. You can feel the positive energy! To add onto the amazing sandwiches..they have quite a selection of bottled drinks that DON'T contain high fructose corn syrup! Yay! I'm waiting for them to make a sandwich with the name 'Party in my Mouf!' Because it was a celebration and it was just me. popoopoo..popoopokeeeer face!
So today I had the pleasure of trying a sandwich from Ike's. I went with the MILF. I am a huge fan of Frank's Red Hot sauce so this was perfect. I was hoping for a little more kick from the Jalapeno poppers, but overall the sandwich was tasty. I called in my order so I did not have to deal with a wait which was convenient. My wife had the menage a Trois. I actually like her sandwich a little more than mine. There were lots of fun flavors. I am glad i gave this place a try. I will definitely go back, just not sure how soon.
Paul Reuben with everything on dutch crunch with a side of lollipop.
This place has been on food network so everyone knows this place. Sandwiches are great. I always like getting the superman or the mnage tois. Downside is these sandwiches are pricy and the wait can be ridiculous. If you've never been there it's worth a try
Solid sammie.How can one go wrong with a sandwich on fresh bread with meatballs and mozzarella sticks??Everyone that works here is super friendly and truly cares about their customers after they have waited in line and tried to disturb the neighborhood......
I love Ike's. Their sandwiches are the most delicious ever. I used to get their 'Pride of Castro' but they stopped carrying brie cheese. I had to adjust and start ordering other stuff, but I am still hoping my favorite comes back. They're a little slow to make the sandwich but the wait is worth it. I go about once a week.
I wish I could help the next Yelper pick a sandwich based upon personal experiences but there are two problems with attempting to do this: (1) there are soooo many choices that there is no way that I could possibly be so conceited to think that the one that I like best will be your favorite too; and (2) after having Ike's sandwiches...and experiencing the food orgasm, nay, multiple food orgasms I can barely remember the names of the sandwiches I had.I always walk away from there with the same feeling I have after an insanely good one-night stand...and trying to explain it to a friend...but can only remember generalities...like part of the name and ...well, you can't remember anything but you just shake your head and say to your friends..."Dude, it was goooood."Except there is no guilt about Ike's and you actually can cultivate a nice little relationship with this menu...essentially it brings out the best emotions you can hope for in a relationship.Lust AND Love ... served daily at Ike's.
"My ex-boyfriend" is the realization of my perfect dream. Simply put, I can't imagine how a sandwich could be better. Toasty, crunchy, savory, melty, goodness. Sans one point because sitting curb side on a fine warm day is fine but not so much on the typical windy day. I don't enjoy chasing my napkin around.
I'm definitely getting old and I'm SO OVER the whole SF thing of waiting in lines to eat. We need more support for small businesses so that we can have more awesome places to eat without waiting in line!I think if I didn't have to wait so long for my sandwich I would have been more thrilled with this place. One day, I will come back to try the Super Mario (?) meatball sandwich with mozzarella fries.We stood in line for 15 minutes to place our order and then waited 30 more to receive the sandwich. Really? 45 minutes for a sandwich? Even when you call in your order, you still end up waiting a while.I was only in the mood for a boring turkey-avo sandwich so that was really not worth the wait. However, I do applaud them on their creative menu and they really do take pride in their sandwiches.
*AGREES WITH ALL OTHER WONDERFUL THINGS SAID ABOUT IKE'S* It is as good as it is hyped to be. No, correction, it's better. Tip: figure out what you want, call it in, pick it up. Don't know about you all, but I turn into a mean mean monster when I have to wait when I'm hungrrrrrry!!!
Oh my god... it's heaven in my mouth.I don't really dig lunch meat all that much so I laughed when I read "Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian" as the name of the sandwich I wanted. Ever since I stopped being a vegetarian a few years ago, I guess that's really what I am. Marinated artichoke hearts? GENIUS! Mushrooms? Delicious! I got mustard and avocado added to mine. No mayo, no tomato, no onions. ALL goodness. SO good. I got a good laugh when I read "Mayo phobes? Just say NO MAYO" because I definitely consider myself mayo-phobic. The bread was so warm and delicious in my mouthhh. God I can't get over it, I'm not even hungry and I want one now just reliving the experience.Plus, they had calypso raspberry pink lemonade... that's probably my favourite drink of all time.I'll definitely be coming here more often.I 290% recommend calling and ordering ahead. HUGE time saver.Parking at 1:30pm on a Tuesday was a breeze, lots of available free parking.--EDIT:It has been a few weeks since my Ike's virginity was taken. Since then I've been at least 5 other times and got a different sandwich each time. I am DETERMINED to try every single one regardless of what's in it. WORTH IT. I'm so madly in love. Anytime I try talking to someone about this place I just say "F*** it, let's go there and you can see for yourself".
Choice of ingredients on choice of breads - some amazing creations are born here. I wont describe my favorites here, or what i had that one time, or that other time, or all those other times that i'd need to try to remember. I will say that Ikes sandwich is a unique experience - like a snowflake - and needs to be experienced by the hungry (yet lucky!) sandwich lover, on its own terms. Then you can regale your friends with stories of this crazy ass sandwich you had at Ikes place on 16th St in SF (or if you choose, you too can be really really vague just like this review).
Whoa, definitely worth the hype! They bake the bread to order, and what a difference that makes. Fresh, soft, Dutch Crunch is awesome. If you like spicy, they have a special Siracha sauce thats excellent. Staff is friendly and energetic. They've hit on something here and you can expect more locations to pop up.There's usually a huge line, so I recommend calling 30-45 min before. You can usually just pull up, pick up and wave to the suckers in line.
Finally I made it to ike's place today for lunch. Luckily it was an early lunch for me so not too much line (only couple of people in front of me). But when I was leaving after picking up my order the line was about 15-20 people. One of the ike's employee had to come out every couple of minutes to ask people to not obstruct/block the sidewalk.Okay now to the main part - SANDWICH. It was just awesome. I had Hot Momma Huda on dutch crunch bread with everything on it (including jalapenos). Sandwich was crunchy and juicy at the same time. chicken was tender and tasty, while the Frank's red hot sauce had right spicy flavor without killing the overall taste of other ingredients. I would definitely come back here whenever I am in SF. Only complain I have is that there's no sitting place in or around the restaurant. However its no big deal unless you are there with a large group.
I heard this location in the Castro had to close b/c of neighbors complaining about the HEAVY customer traffic and congestion! I would love to own a business with that problem!!!! K-ching!!! My first experience was at that location and I loved it! ***I have never stood outside for 35 minutes in the rain waiting to order from a deli, nor have I ever had a sandwich I liked more!*** I remember eating their hoagie-style sandwich and thinking, 'Is this really this good?' Since the wait is crazy long, b/c they're insanely bz all the time the service is totally just that of an outdoor vendor, just trying to get through the line of the starving masses, but their food is so epic it does not matter! I'd put up with just about anything for another one of their sandwiches!!!
After watching the SF episode of Man Vs. Food, I was very curious about Ike's Place. Seeing that they served mozzarella sticks in their sandwiches seemed like a dream come true, so when my friend invited me to go with him to Ike's I was more than delighted to do so.I didn't really know what to expect from Ike's. I've tried Roxie's and Little Lucca's and to be honest, I thought they had good sandwiches, but nothing spectacular or even distinguishable from a sandwich I could simply make at home. Prior to trying Ike's, I believed that a sandwich was a sandwich, what more could you get out of it?It wasn't until I tried Ike's Place that I realized a sandwich is more than just a sandwich. An Ike's sandwich is pure genius mixed in with magnificence. The first bite I took out from "Mr. Sanderson" filled me with utmost bliss. The mozzerella sticks, avocado and bacon on dutch crunch served with tomatoes, lettuce, peppers, pickles and dirty sauce was the perfect combination, it was the true definition of a sandwich.I seriously have nothing bad to say about Ike's Place-- we luckily beat the line, so we didn't have to wait no longer than 15 minutes, the service was nice, the sandwiches were amazing and the prices were reasonable. I plan on frequenting Ike's and hopefully be able to try all the different funny named sandwiches they have to offer.
best sandwich ever! tried what everyone on here recommended. dutch crunch bread, dirty sauce, and menage a trois. DELICIOUS! and i tried the funky and jalapeno chips. preferred the jalapeno ones. also they have no seating!
Just tried this place for the first time the other day after walking by its packed lines for some time. I finally know what all the hype is about - the sandwich I got was very delicious (called 'The girl I'm dating') savory, juicy, and fresh - my mouth is watering just thinking about it.The only negative -- I called in my order so i didn't have to stand in line - they were 30 minutes late in getting my order, and also gave me the wrong sandwich when I finally got it. Fortunately they caught their mistake and ran down the street to catch me. I think my sandwhich might have been ready earlier - but it was crazy when i got there so I think they forgot about me until I reminded them again and again that I was there.I still give it high marks for the quality of food - I could of went on an off day. I will certainly try another one of their scrumptious sandwiches soon.
Went there for the second time and this place didn't let me down. The first time i had Vegetarian meatball sandwich which was great. However this time i decided to be adventurous and tried the Eli Manning sandwich. The sandwich is Gigantic. All the subway foot long sandwich eaters, look no further if you want a more filling 6" tastier sandwich. thankfully i didn't have to wait at all. Got there around 7:15pm. I will highly suggest calling in for your order to avoid the long lines. People working at this place are genuinely nice. I am so excited that i can find tasty halal sandwiches somewhere in this big state :)
I like sandwiches and this is some of best of the best. Having a BBE coupon doesn't hurt at all either. Lines pretty long usually and the parking is even tougher. Don't forget your bag of chips!!
Ike's Place is my number one choice for a delicious sandwich. I usually order the Tony Soprano or the Barry B since I love meat and bacon. I have been a long time fan now and I must say the original crew is much better than the new hires they have in recent times, not to say that it is anything less than great, just better when you have the OG's making your sandwich. If you are in San Francisco, and especially anywhere in the Castro, you MUST MUST MUST go to Ike's Place and get one of their legendary sandwiches. I swear if you don't, you are missing out on an SF experience. Thanks Ike's!
These guys are doing it right! So happy to see such a creative vegan sandwich menu! I ordered the vegan owl and it was really good. Can't wait for my next sandwich! One tip... Call your order ahead so you can bypass the long line!
This place was so awesome!! Delicious sandwiches!!! I love how its just a small joint where. Pretty self explanatory. No seating, U get in line, U order your sandwich and monch on!! So good! The menage tois!! ooo baby!! cannot complain with such fresh ingredients and warm crispy dutch crunch bread?? Cmon?? try this place out. You will definitely get a kick out of all the clever names of the sandwiches. we also got the fried chicken sandwich in the buttermilk biscuit and gravy!! A+ and the turkey club! I can honestly say all their sandwiches are clean, crispy and fresh!!!
I could have sworn I wrote a review for this fine establishment. Came here about two years ago. I ordered a salmon sammie. It was divine. The sauce was the perfect finishing touch on the sandwich. I'm upset, that we won't get an IKEs at SFSU.
My cousin took me to Ike on a rainy Sunday morning. He said he wasn't leaving town until he has his Ike fix. I was telling myself, this place had better have the best sandwiches in town to get me out of the house in the rain. But I was curious since Adam Richmond of Man vs. Food came to Ike in one of his shows.When we arrived, there was alreay 4 people before us waiting for their order. We stepped up to the register counter just outside the store next to a huge menu board plobbed against the store window. The list on that menu is long. To add to our challenge of deciding what to order, the guy at the counter handed us a menu that he claimed has more than 100 kinds of sandwiches. Holy cow! What should I have? We were at the counter awhile before we could order our sandwiches. The guy was helpful with giving us ideas and suggestions.Finally we ordered. I had the Nacho Boy --thin slices of roast beef with provolone grilled onions, lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, and avocado in a French roll. My cousin had the Nacho Boy Supreme -- same thing as mine except his has bacon. After ordering, we ran back to the car to wait for our sandwiches. About 10 minutes later, we got them. Unwrapped the brown waxes paper to reveal the warm sandwichwes. It was so good. Warm toasted buns with tender roast beef slices and all the right accompaniment. Even though we had to eat it in our car because the joint doesn't have tables for sit down, it was worth it. And actually gave the sandwich a unique flavor. So overall, it was worth it to get out of the house braving the cold rainy day to make a trip to Ike. By the time we finished our sandwiches, the line was 12 people deep. Boy were we glad we got there just in time.
Everytime my boyfriend and I venture to the city we always make a stop at Ike's. Delicious goodness in my tummy. When you go there it's not really a sit-down type of restaurant. They have a booth outside of a tiny shop, where all the sandwich making magic happens! The line can be pretty intense and I haven't ever called in an order, but I would probably recommend it if you're not the patient type. There are so many different sandwich combos and each one that I have tried is equally amazing. They have to have some crack laced in each of their sandwiches because I could never get enough! The customer service is on point as well. During my first visit to Ike's one of the guys gave me a breakdown of what I would like and what I wouldn't. I totally appreciate their patience with me because I can be so indecisive!The sandwiches are HUGE and messy and oh so yummy! One sandwich is really enough to share, but one bite and you will become this selfish fatty! Thank goodness for places like Ike -- a true gem!
I ate a vegan sandwich today and if I were to deconstruct the thing, I'll tell you that fake meat is nasty... That's what's so f-ing cool about Ike: they can make a sandwich with this really nasty filler, but when put together as a whole it's delicious.Healthier or not I'm never doing that again.Damn, Ike is on fire. He's got a full staff of smart asses now, and if they weren't whipping out such goodness, I'd have given them a tongue lashing today. But these are Ike's people, so I ain't gonna mess with them. Although, if I ever see you working somewhere else, get ready. Ike built Ike's Place. Remember that sh*t!
A tad bit overrated I would say....I had The "Matt Cain" sandwich which is from what I hear one of the best sandwiches in the nation. It was decent but I only got through half of it and got bored.Also tried The "Menage a Trois" which appears to be the female favorite and that was a little sweet but indeed interesting.Overall I would say overrated but good huge menu which leaves something for everyone but also causes the line to back up because people have no clue what they want!
There's very limited sit down on the outside of this place. The price is a lil high for the portion they give u. However, they totally make up the small portions with frshe ingredient and taste. Service was a little slow, but all in all it was worthed the wait. Next time will try " the dirty ernie " sandwich.
That first bite, of mill's vikings, was heavenly. You might have to wait a while in the queue, but I dont mind as long as what goes into my stomach at the end of it is as good as this place.This place has no sitting area, so you have to stand/sit on the sidewalk, which might not suit everyone. But overall 5 stars for the food.
Even a sink full of vomit couldn't ruin my appetite for Ike's. Yes, a sink full of vomit.I've been longing to try Ike's and with the encouragement of a buy 1 get 1 free coupon for my birthday, my wife and I went to Ike's @ Lime. First, I would like to say how great it is to have an eatery where you can imbibe in whatever alcoholic drink suits your fancy while you chow down. However, like all "club" environments, people can do things to excess, with the above mentioned results.While waiting for our sandwiches in their lounging/eating area, which is "OK", I needed to use the restroom. I was surprised to see a line, so I needed to ask to confirm and I was told there was no line for the other, but that it was covered in puke. Not a stranger to raucous venues, I ventured in. Although it wasn't everywhere, it was quite apparent someone had a little too much. The sink was completely full and not draining, and considering how long the line was, it appeared management wasn't in a hurry to clean it (they never did the whole time we were there). Thank you hand sanitizer... my own.Now onto the sandwiches:It was very difficult to choose a sandwich; they had so many interesting and delicious looking combinations. After we changed our selections several times, I settled on the King Koopa (All Beef Meatballs, Mozzarella Sticks, Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers, Marinara) and my wife the Eli Manning (Halal Chicken Breast, Zesty Garlic and Herb Sauce, Mushrooms, Avocado, Cheddar).Both had amazing flavor profiles. I was surprised with the Koopa and how everything just went together, sloppy, but not too sloppy. It makes me wonder what other sandwiches would go good with stuffed jalapeno poppers, really... I can't believe how much they add to a meatball sandwich. The Eli Manning was excellent, the chicken was cooked perfectly. Ike's puts the right amount of everything on the sandwich.I definitely have to say, Ike's makes a spectacular sandwich and I can't wait to try other combinations.Will I go back to Ike's? Absoultely, but I would rather get it to go or brown bag a beer and eat on the curb than deal with the chaotic scene that is Lime.
FOOD:1.) Eli Manning = Chicken, Avacado, mushroom.2.) Legend of Zelda = Meatball sandwich. Not bad!* I normally get hankerings for sandwiches but I wasn't craving sandwiches so much that day. I'm sure if I was then I would've LOVED it. But yeah, I LIKED it. And I'm not sure if it's coz I normally like cold sandwiches but Ike's Place seems like mostly warm sandwichesSERVICE:Only for to go...Nice workers.ATMOSPHERE:It's like a little sweat shop in there lol. I hear there used to be a few tables to sit, but I guess this place became so popular they needed all the space to make as many sandwiches as possible. So yeah, wait in line outside, order your food, wait outside for you food, then find somewhere to eat it haha.
This place lives up to the hype, and as a Gluten-Free/Corn-Free diner, it was awesome to finally be able to eat a sandwich!If you're allergic to corn, make sure to hold the Ike's Sauce. The bread was served warm and toasty and the owner quickly responded via email to my food allergy concerns. I came back the next day and ordered to my exact specifications (Gluten-Free bread, no sauce please!)
A little love goes into every sandwich. They are simply awesome. Great quality of the food.It did take 35 min. We were running late to the airport, and they had lost or order. They were nice about it, but it was a bit touch and go and I was starving.
More like 3.75 stars. I am a huge fan of sandwiches and eat them all the time so I just had to try Ike's. There really was no way around it. It's so highly reviewed and I at least need to say I ate here once. The line seemed to be relatively short for a Sunday at lunchtime, but I did notice a ton of pickup orders anyway. I ordered something with a polish sausage on it, and the husband ordered the eggplant. Decent and pretty good at the same time for a hot sandwich. Since there isn't many tables, this place is almost completely "to-go". By the time we got to our eating destination (about 20 minutes) - my sandwich was already soggy from the grease. Bleh. It is also larger then one should eat for one sitting. So I ate half . .. and the other half went to waste. Hot sandwiches really can't be eaten the next day. Wilty lettuce isn't my thing. Kudos for the unique fried toppings (Mozz sticks, jalapeno poppers, etc) which probably brings them a lot of business. All of which didn't appeal to this healthy sandwich lover. If you are the kind of sandwich lover who loves to load up on the veggies instead of the meat or faux-meat. I would go elsewhere, but it's worth the experience to try it out at least once.
Calm down people, a sandwich is just a sandwich! I actually don't know what I ate, because they screwed up my order, but it tastes like a classic egg sandwich. The other sandwich, the [Name the girl you're dating], is a normal sandwich that has been perfected with a lollipop on top.Total wait time is about 25mins (from standing in line to getting your sandwich). I would suggest ordering ahead of time, which still might require you a 5-10min wait, but their menu takes a while to get through any way, so you can just wait in line while deciding what you want. Note: If you've never had the brand of chips that comes with the sandwich, it's saltier than the lays or pringles brand.
All right - this place has been on my short list for a while and I finally had a chance to check it out last night and it was worth the wait. I had the MILF (A Hot Mama with jalapeno poppers - it had some heat and um no adverse side-effects the next day) and it was delish and messy, just like a MILF should be ;) Next time I will skip on the onion rings and try the fries. Besides the sandwich is pretty filling by itself.Definitely will be back to try the other items on the menu. They have pretty funny names for their sandwiches here that you will have to check out for yourself.
Pros:- Warm Sandwiches in the hood where there really aren't any other sandwich joints.-Free sandwich on your bday, yeeeaah.-excellent veggie sandwich options-decent bread and excellent beverage selection-if you like soggy,saucy sammies, this place is for you.\Cons (hence the 3 stars)-organize your menu kids-the line, dude the line man. take a lesson from in-n-out burger, get someone outside writing down orders, don't let frustrated customers bail.-10bucks=too much for a sandwich.-degrade your employees in private not in full view of the customers, I think this actually makes the sandwiches taste worse.-messing up orders is commonplace here..lies somewhere in the mini post-it ordering system and neo-mission grungy hipster "I work at the latest trendy joint so f*ck you whateva wait your turn while I forget about you so I can go snort some bumps in the back, I'll get to you when I feel like it if I remember"' employee talent pool.Not bad, but not great. the hype people, the hype.phone ordering is the way to go if you like this place, that is if they answer the phone...
I had a Montana to Rice(meatball, marinara and pepper jack cheese) and it's the best meatball sandwich ever! Just so full of flavor and just delicious. My gf ordered Nacho Boy (Hot Roast Beef, Mushrooms, Avocado, -Swiss) and it tasted pretty good as well. They have a ton of other sandwiches to choose from so i don't think you could go wrong with whatever sandwich you choose. Only negative i would have is the lack of seating but luckily we got 1 of the 3 tables haha. Other then that it is a great place to eat at and one of the best eating finds i have found.
With a couple dozen or so choices, I find myself rotating the same 3 or 4 delicious sandwiches but always wanting to venture out to a new. Toasted bread, melted cheese, and of course the "dirty sauce", there's just something about this place that keeps me coming back. The 45 min wait on the weekend should not be a discouragement, because the sandwich is an experience you will never forget!
This place rocks! No seriously, it does. The bf and I literally walked a journey to get to this place in the rain and in the end, it was totally worth it! We wanted to do some weekend shopping at Union Square and decided to go rain or no rain. By the time we arrived in the city, the landscape and atmosphere was drenched with rain and I mean covered in massive H2O.After a long strenuous exercising course around Union Square and dropping money like it was candy, the inevitable feeling of emptiness took complete control over our little tummies; yes, it truly was hunger. Wanting to try something new, we yelped Ike's Place and decided to walk there in the rain from Union Square. Call us crazy, but it was quite an exhilarating journey. 2 miles in the rain and wind and we finally made it to the place which looked like seriously a small hole in the wall/ghetto shack in the middle of a neighborhood. Not trying to judge the place based on its appearance, I looked at the menu and found the menu quite humorous. I ended up ordering #100, Eli Manning, which consisted of shredded chicken breast, mushrooms, avocados, garlic herbs, cheddar cheese, and the regular provided condiments in the sandwich all on dutch crunch bread. MMM YUM...that's all I can say. Just thinking about the sandwich makes me crave another one.The perfect ingredients to complement the perfect sandwich. Now that's what I call a darn good sandwich! I wish there was an Ike's closer to San Jose. I plan on making at least a monthly trip to devour their delicious sandwiches :)
If the wait extends to the end of the sidewalk - it will be at least a 40 minute wait. If this is the case, just call in your order. Ike's fresh baked bread makes it all worth your while and wait. Shared two sandwiches: an unoriginal pastrami on dutch crunch and the stupid eggplant. BOTH were on point.
Finally had a chance to give Ike's a go. Mid 40's, windy, hour long long. Decided to wait anyways, and oh man was it worth it. Everything I'll say has probably been said before... but just wanted to get my vote in. I was eating my sandwiches (joker and hot momma) and it didn't matter if the bite had any meat, cheese, or any combination of those on it. I could have had a bite of just dirty sauce, just bread, just anything and it was awesome. How do they do it?? They are super nice with the service as well, which works out perfectly because I can imagine people getting a bit irate waiting an hour for a sandwich on top of rude service. I probably won't wait in line for a sando again anytime soon, but absolutely will call in an order and pick it up when they tell me to. Go with a friend so they can snag the sandwiches while you just hover in a probably illegal loading zone to save the parking hassle. Either way, if you are curious check this place out.
I give this place 4 stars only because I like leaving room for the unknown, but to date Ike's definitely takes 1st place on my list of sandwich shops. It's awesome when places that have been hyped up for me by all my friends and fellow Yelpers live up to their reputation; simply put, Ike's is something special. I ordered the Superman, a sandwich filled with Roast Beef, Corned Beef, Pastrami, Salami, Turkey, Bacon, Ham, Avocado, and Jack Cheese; it was glorious. Normally, when you order a sandwich there they give you a choice of bread, but when I ordered the Superman they simply told me "We're just gonna find the largest roll we have". The sandwich comes out, and it turns out that the Superman is as long as two of their normal rolls, piled about 4"- 5" high. Needless to say, it was destruction, and I had to power-nap before taking the long drive back across the bridge home. Long (but sociable) line aside, Ike's is something every sandwich lover needs to experience.
A fan of 'Man vs Food' escaped to San Francisco for the weekend. Decided to try Ikes and was not let down. Ordered 'The Kryptonite' sandwich. Very filling and very delicious. Cut in half, it is actually two sandwiches in one. You will not be disappointed! This is no Subway! Go early, or you will wait for 30 plus minutes. The line comes out the door and wraps around the building. This is a good thing!! The bad---no seating-none.
What was I thinking ordering the Kryptonite and a King Koopa?!?! Ok, I know, I wasn't thinking. My boyfriend & I said to ourselves, why not try the biggest sandwich they had, you know, end it big in the last day of 2009. When the sandwiches came out and Ike told us that the sandwich itself was 4 1/2 - 5 lbs, I was scared. We got home and my bf & I each took half of the Kryptonite, sitting on the floor knowing we would easily fall in the end because of food coma. There were 4 different types of meat stacked to about 3-4 inches high, mozzarella sticks, jalapeno poppers, and beer battered onion rings all in ONE sandwich!! No wonder this was featured in the man vs. food. We didn't eat the King Koopa (all beef meatballs, jalapeno poppers, mozzarella sticks, and marinara sauce) until later on that night. The Kryptonite got a little salty at the end, but other than that, I would order this again! Along with the King Koopa!
If there's one thing we're Nazis about, it's sandwiches. Think about when you make one at home; you don't just take some crap and throw it between flat crap. Sandwiches are an art. I still contemplate the philosophy, art, flavor chemistry of my sandwiches each time I make one to sit down and watch a Cubbies game. To this point, Ike's recognizes this and has about 5,000 diff. sandwiches, so you get what you want. I would recommend checking the website/menu before you go. With so many options, it takes time to make up your mind. This can be awkward here considering it's packed with people and the place has room enough for the cash register and a butt cheek partial.I had the Castro Special (ham, turkey, brie) with bacon and sprouts, extra dirty (of course) and it was top notch. Also the portions are perfect. This is important with sandwiches because they're mainly a lunch food. Everybody wants to be full, but sometimes there's nothing worse than a mid-day food coma. Separately, how can you hate on a place that gives you a tootsie pop with each sandwich?Ike is a totally nice guy and has his mind on the customer.
Yeaaaa I love this place!!!What stands out the most about Ike's Place is the bread - their bread is sooo scrumptious that a simple slice of cheese on it would've been perfs!! I ordered the burger, which I enjoyed very much! Looking at my sandwich, I thought it was small, but boy was I wrong. I could barely finish it but I kept wanting to eat it because it was just sooo good! My boyfriend ordered the Not Tonight, I Have a Headache. Halal Chicken Breast, Bacon, BBQ, Smoked Gouda. A little sweet, but very very tasty!!! Also, the dirty sauce they put on the sandwiches are a special treat!!I wish they served french fries with the sandwiches.. I think they do on certain days so I would've liked to have gone that particular day. Luckily, we arrived pretty early in the day so the wait in line was less than 5 minutes. Seating is almost impossible but thanks to my persistent nature and ability to see movement from the corner of my eyes, I was quick to find us a tiny spot to enjoy our first meal of the day. By the time we were done with our sandwiches, the line to order literally hugged the walls of neighboring neighbors. So good luck with that, folks!Other than that, I wish I lived in the city so I can try a new sandwich every day.
Definitely the best sandwich I have ever eaten. I recommend the Matt Cain which Roast Beef, Turkey, Salami, God Father Sauce, Provolone. Add mozzarella sticks to the sandwich for a small charge. Definitely worth the Long wait
Sandwich paradise! My goodness! My dreams are fulfilled!It is a bit overwhelming walking into the cramped storefront and seeing the literal pages of sandwich options here. Adorning the walls is the regular menu, but then strewn about are Ike's original sandwich creations often named something witty like the "Paul Ruebens Sandwich" or the "Change" sandwich complete with Obama rings (aka onion rings).I opted for the "Cristina and Umair Go to Ike's Place" with Turkey, Bacon, Ham, Salami, Italian Dressing, Avocado, Provolone. On a dutch crunch roll, it was heaven wrapped in deli paper. The wait was quite long, but totally worth it. Grab a ginger beer and sit on one of the mismatched folding chairs out front and enjoy the ride to sandwich heaven. Seriously, I'm not kidding. Go now!
I'm not much of a sandwich girl to begin with in the first place, but since it is our anniversary, I decided to take my fiance here for a late lunch. The line wasn't as long as I've read it can be on Yelp. We got there a little after 2 I believe so I guess the lunch rush just died down. As we stood in line, we were a bit frazzled, didn't know what to do because the cashier was standing at a little cart taking orders and collecting payment. There are so many delectable selections on the menu, but we finally decided on the #26 which was the meat lovers one, I forget the exact name, but it's the one with a lot of meat, not the kryptonite, although that one does look like an interesting sandwich, $17 for a sandwich basically filled with everything. I would like to maybe conquer that one, one of these days... Anyway, the workers were really nice from what I witnessed. The sandwich is HUGE and is full of flavor! Every single piece of meat was so delicious, you could taste the difference in all the flavors! YUMMY! My fiance said that it is the BEST sandwich he'd ever tasted in his whole entire life, and he's had a LOT of them up until this point. My point is, I am very glad that I discovered this place through my Yelp friends and cousin. But, I just realized that they have an IKE's in Redwood City! Closer to my home! YAY! That means I will be visiting that location more often! :) WOOHOO! I HIGHLY recommend this place to EVERYONE! You have never truly experienced a sandwich that even comes close to tasting like the sandwiches here! You are missing out if you have not been here!
I was hesitant to drop 13+ on a sandwich, but once I found out about the damon bruce it was over. Its like a kinder's sandwich on steroids dipped awesome. The steak bacon and beer battered onion rings mesh with that sauce better than any other sandwich
me and my girlie paula j went here on a rather dark and foggy day.. but ike's place made my day! :Di got the VEGAN menage a trois, and a large bucket of air fries! ... great sandwich place for vegans, trying to be vegans, and icky meat eaters.... AHHAHA.. they're very accomodating on their menu, and the owner is cute! lol... other than that, no BS or any bad stuff to say... oh YES.. always get the DIRTY SAUCE.. i heard it's on a pending approval for a patent.. but the sauce is fantabulous!
Awesome veggie sandwiches...no place to eat inside, but Dolores park us a few blocks and offers amazing view of the city.
I don't like sandwiches -- never have. Rather go hungry than eat a sandwich. He still dragged me Sat. morning kicking and screaming (ok, I'm exagging, but I wasn't looking forward to Ike's).   He eagerly orders the Nacho Boy with hot roast beef, mushroom, avocado, and swiss. I reluctantly order the Barry B of turkey, swiss and bacon. Food arrives. He's fawning over Nacho Boy and going on and on about how it's the best sandwich in the world. I turn and roll my eyes.I'm like whatevs as I bite into Barry. I take another bite of Barry. Oh Barry. Oooooh Bububububbubaarrrrrrry! B-A-A-A-A- R- R- Y! You are making my insides quiver. Turkey was fresh and piled high. Bread was incredible and it didn't overpower the sandwich. Fresh, good quality ingredients with just the right amount of toppings and condiments. Ike's is for two kinda people: 1. People who love sammiches. 2. People who dislike sammiches. BOTH types will love Ike's. It's truly worth the high ratings!
I've been on Yelp hiatus, but my lunch today at Ike's Place is enough reason to bring me back. I thought I had good sandwiches, but a trip over the bridge to the Castro helped me remember what a GOOD sandwich is and should be like. I've had my eye on Ike's Place for awhile and it took a Saturday afternoon to bring me here. Luckily, there was no line and plenty of time to think about what to order. I had the Hot Momma Huda (halal chicken breast, frank's red hot sauce, ranch, provolone...and I added jalapenos). My BF had the Hollywood's SF CheeseSteak.My sandwich was on dutch crunch bread, which is my absolute fave and it was toasted to a crispy warm goodness. The sandwich was a messy one, but the hot sauce combined with the ranch dressing was a nice flavor and added the tanginess that I so desperately craved. I loved the halal chicken breast and thought it was a great texture compared to the usual chicken breast. I had a bite of the Hollywood's SF CheeseSteak, but was too engrossed with my sandwich I was not able to make a fair opinion, but from the rave reviews he gave me, I think it was a two thumbs up. :)A great sandwich shop and a helpful reminder to me what good food should taste like!! I will be back again...and again...again again again agin. :)
I recall, ages ago, two enthusiastic young men running up to me on the corner of 16th & Sanchez to give me a coupon for the new sandwich shop they'd just opened. The menu looked good, and I meant to drop in for a bite soon. Tonight, I finally did. How can you not order a sandwich called a Paul Reubens? Tasty, tasty treat. Plus, it was happy hour, so it came with a drink and bag of chips on the house. My friend had the forethought to tell me to call in our order an hour before we arrived, which was a wise, wise move. You don't have to wait in line for phone orders. If you are waiting in line, though- don't block the sidewalk.Extra bonus- they've lots of vegan options and everything seems to be halal as well.
After driving past this place several times and seeing a huge line out the door, we decided to give it a shot today. I thought if we went during an odd hour between lunch and dinner time that it would help with the wait... no luck. It felt like we were there FOREVER! While placing the order for 1 burger and 1 chicken sandwich I asked the girl at the register to hold the mayo on both. She was very insistent on us trying the aioli since that apparently makes these sandwiches so great. We hate mayonnaise, aioli, and anything that has a hint of the taste or texture of mayo. Seriously, it brings up the gag reflex. I couldn't stress this enough and we literally got into a debate over whether or not to have the sandwiches with the dirty sauce. Though frustrating, she gave her spiel, and we still declined to have it on either sandwich. We finally got our sandwiches and headed home. 15 minutes later, after getting situated and ready to eat, we each take a half of each sandwich and are ready to sample. The burger was my number one choice and as I take my first bite, that taste and texture of aioli fills my mouth. I open it up and sure enough, covered with the stuff! We tried to scrape it off with a knife but they bake it into the bread first then smear it into the sandwich again while making it. I know this is their process as it was described in detail while debating with the cashier chick. Luckily the chicken sandwich didn't seem to have all the mayo crap on it, so it was better, but still nothing to rave about. I called them over the phone asking for a refund since the sandwich was inedible. We had to take another trip down there and with the parking being impossible, I had to jump out while my boyfriend circled the block until I was done. The manager was very sympathetic and offered to give us another sandwich made without the sauce or free sandwiches on our next visit. The whole process was such a hassle and the sandwiches left this dirty, thick, greasy taste in my mouth for hours... no thank you! He was very nice and gave me a refund for the whole order. SYNOPSIS: $24 bucks and over an hour long ordering process for 2 gross sandwiches and 1 still came with dirty sauce after having a full on conversation insisting on NO AIOLI OR MAYO...fucking A this was terrible! I give 1 star for management giving me my money back. If you like really unhealthy, super greasy, heavy sandwiches that you'll continue to taste for hours afterwards and lingers in your mouth until you brush your teeth, this place is for you!!!
I had heard of Ike's Place when they first opened in San Francisco. I knew that they had a number of vegan and vegetarian sandwiches. However, I had no idea how popular it was until I actually went to San Francisco and made it down to Ike's. Once there I ate what it is one of the top three sandwiches I have ever had in my life.In the interest of full disclosure I will point out that I am part of the company that supplies Ike's with their vegan cheese. (welovesoy.com) But that's not influencing my review at all.There was a pretty long line when we arrived around dinner time, but we queued up and it didn't take long to order and then it was a 10 minute or so wait for our sandwiches. I had the vegan Meatless Mike on sourdough. They bake the bread when you order the sandwich, so you have this amazing fresh bread as a palate for Ike's ingredients. There are tons of reviews on Yelp about Ike's and I doubt anything I say will convince you to try it if you are on the fence. I just wanted to add yet another sparkling review to the mix. They are doing it right at Ike's.
Best sandwiches I've ever had. I've tried the chicken, beef and vegan options. Portions are large.
Stopped by here today after reading all the hype in the Chronicle. Good sandwich, but make sure you know what to order b/c they have a wide variety. I ordered(they're only taking phone orders) 2 different sandwiches just to make sure Ike's is consistent with the quality and quantity. Both, the #1 Elvis Kieth and #25 Barry Bonds, were very good. They give you a free bag of chips and a lollipop w/every sandwich. Check the website for pricing.
crappy sandos
Big pile of food, so good value for the price. Bit too much of their special sauce on all the sandwiches, so they all pretty much taste the same.
best.sandwiches.ever
Both Menage A Trois (chicken) & Damon Bruce (rib eye) sandwiches were really good. Kinda pricey for sandwiches though.
Ike, how do you make your sandwiches so delicious?No, wait... don't spoil the secret. I'm sure it includes bacon grease, kitten tears, or something that will make me feel uber guilty.I love how your employees are really passionate about the food. Yeah, the wait is insane, but I feel like the people working there really want me to love my sandwich.Going home for Thanksgiving on dutch crunch with Sriracha. 'Nuff said.
This place makes wonderful sandwiches! I can't go to SF and not stop by for sandwiches. I hope Ike opens up near Rancho Cucamonga, so I can make this place one of my regulars.
While it's been said before I have to repeat it, if you're like most of us you're thinking, "How good can a sandwich really be?" I agree. I thought the same thing. Till I came here. Wow. I mean..wow. Look at the reviews? These people aren't all sandwich lovers. Chances are they're like me. They come here with their doubts and hesitations then walk out singing Ike's praises in the form of yelp reviews. Not that this place needs any more business, but go out of your way to try this place out. If you want to miss the wait, call ahead of time, place your order and they will tell you what time your sandwich will be ready. (Usually about 20-45 min after placing the call). After you pick up your sandwich head over to Dolores park and enjoy.
Overrated but still good.
I most recently enjoyed the "Sanchez College Prep" with added onion rings while my Ike's virginity was stolen by the legendary "King Koopa," and neither disapointed in the least.The Sanchez, with chicken, bbq and cheddar, seemed to yearn for the onion rings and i was correct in feeling so. Tightly packed together and bursting with banana peppers, pickles tomato and onion, this is one of the most solid sandwiches known to man.The King Koopa, a hybrid of the Mario and Luigi, blessed us with the glorius Meatball sandwich with some special guest appearances that make you cry for the princess; lined with jalapeno poppers and mozzerla cheeze sticks, this marinara infused beauty was one of the most creative sandwiches i ever tasted.Note: We called our order of 8 sandwiches at 10:30AM to be picked up at 3:30PM. We skipped a huge line of hungry, angry patrons. When we ordered 3 sandwiches last time, we called in at 11AM and asked if they could have it by 1PM. They informed us that theywouldn't be ready until 1:20PM which was definitley okay with us.DEFINITLEY call first and be nice to them on the phone. This place is Awesome. It's like eating your sandwich in a cartoon world.
Wow... why are you so good, Ike's? Is it the bread? The massive meaty goodness in between the toasted dutch crunch? Is it the dirty sauce? It doen't matter. All I know is I tried the place for the first time last Saturday and already made the 50 minute drive back out to the city for a second helping and will be making my third trip in less than three weeks this Thursday! So back to the question, why you so good Ike's? I'm supposed to be dieting and you make me go eat three giant sandwiches to kill my diet plans. But it's okay. I forgive you because I don't know anywhere else where I can find mozarella sticks in my meatball sandwich.5 stars for the food and 5 stars for the service.
Don't believe the hype. I'll take any bahn mi or torta spot in the city over Ike's any day. The sandwiches are good, but not exceptional. I've been about a half dozen times and the wait is typically absurd, and half the time they have gotten my order wrong.I'm sure some people love the bewildering variety of options at this place, but I don't. From my perspective there are just too many trivial varieties that aren't worth thinking about. All that being said, if you're vegetarian or with a vegetarian, and trying to get a sandwich in the area this is probably your go to place. But everyone else should be hitting up Mr. Pickles for basically the same deal.
After eating a big breakfast, strolled over here upon a friend's recommendation to pick up a sandwich for the drive back to LA. Took a bite, and it was over. All I remember is the sinking feeling I had, as bite followed bite, of knowing that I would not have a lunch, and the deliciousness that was that sandwich.Rarely do things live up to hype like this. Only wish it were cheaper so that it could be a staple in my diet - oh, and that I were actually local so that would be possible. But you gotta shell for something so good.
4 stars for the food1 star for the experience and serviceSorry yelpers, this is gonna be a long review... I was VERY excited to finally eat at Ike's sandwiches because of all the great reviews from friends and Yelp. I went here on a Monday afternoon with 5 other people. After reading some reviews, we decided to use the iPhone app to order our sandwiches in attempt to avoid the long lines. Upon arriving at Ike's there wasn't a line, we told the cashier that we had ordered thru the app and he instructed us to sit in the lounge area and he would be right with us. After waiting 5 min, we asked him again and he looked like he completely forgot about us. Well, he probably did because he was doing everything in the front of the place. He was handing out menus, taking orders, and being the cashier. Then the cashier tells us that our order will not be ready until 2 (it was only 1pm) because the app can only take 10 orders per hour. If that was the case, then we could have just waited in line and placed in our order. What is the point of having an app if you are just going to make phone orders and sit-in orders first? If so, that should be stated on the app somewhere. At that point, we just wanted to get our food ASAP so we asked if we could just order and they can cancel the order for the later time. The cashier then told us that it would be considered "cutting" because other people were in line. WTH? U were the one who told us to wait in the lounge area in the first place when there wasn't even a line. So we had to go to the back of the line to place another order in for the food we had already preordered thru the iPhone app. Another thing that is really unorganized is that people who have phone orders can just cut everyone in line. So it's OK for people with phone orders to cut in line, but we had to go to the back of the line for app orders? That does not make any kind of sense to me. Then when we finally get to the cashier, he tells us that he already put in our order and that it will be ready in 10-20 min. I didn't understand that either. I could have just waited in the lounge area instead of standing in line for 30 min. So after all that was said and done, we finally get our food at 2 which was an hour of waiting. I would advise people to just phone in your orders because the iPhone app sucks. Another suggestion for Ike's management would be having a line for phone orders, iPhone app orders, and sit-in orders. I don't think one type of order should have priority over another. I was EXTREMELY disappointed with the service at Ike's. I really wanted to love the place too because I love good food. Sadly, I will not be returning to this location, but I will give the Redwood City location a try.
Sandwiches are good! Too many varieties and selections to count.. Kryptonite is GINORMOUS! Dirty sauce is delicious, a must have in most sandwiches at Ike's. Some sandwiches are kinda on the expensive side tho.
Since moving back to LA, Ikes is the only thing I really truly regret leaving. I hate my life.
Great sandwiches! Even the mock chicken was really good, I would never order vegan style sandwiches but the one I tried was so good I would eat it again. Service was efficient & friendly and the food is awesome
Woo-hoo! Review 1300!What can I say that hasn't been said. If you haven't been here, you're missing out. I personally love the Pride of the Castro on Dutch Crunch.Seriously, why are you still reading and not on your way already?!
I don't even need to say anything, I am just gonna give it five stars and leave it at that.
Got the Menage Tois.. it was good, but I think I'll try something else next time. The sandwish was too sweet for me, I think its the honey they put in it. I ordered it because the 100 Big Eats SF list said it was the thing to get. The service was fast and very friendly. And we made it here just before the lunch rush... I will be coming back to try other sandwich concoctions!
I went here for dinner last night.This is THE sandwich shop.The sandwiches here are so good, and there is such a variety. Even the names of the sandwiches are entertaining. I ordered the Eli Manning. I'm an Eagles fan, so I was kinda bummed they didn't have a Donovan McNabb. The sandwich was sooo good that I didn't mind.All I can really say is if you're hungry and you've got $10 and are in the Castro area. This is where you want to be.The only complaint I have is the crashing feeling of loss after you finish one of these things. I wanted to go back and get another immediately. I can see people becoming seriously addicted.+ Great Sandwiches made to your taste+ Great names for sandwiches+ Great people behind the counter+ Great price
This place is wayyyyyy over hyped. My boyfriend and I went to this place based on the reviews here and were extremely disappointed. The place is tiny ( 4 or 5 two-person tables), service is slow and tables were next to trashcans. We got something equivalent to a turkey sandwich and a Reuben sandwich. The sandwiches were not as big as people made it out to be. They're just normal sized...8 inch sandwiches. The ingredients in both sandwiches were nothing out of ordinary. The turkey sandwich is okay. It was moist because it was doused in some sort of dressing. The Reuben sandwich was surprisingly dry. They tasted very ordinary to us and for the price you pay (about 8 dollars), we rather go to Subway/Quiznos. It would save us time and money and probably end up with happier taste buds.
This is where I take my friends to eat when they visit. When they visit again, they request that we go back, and I am more than happy to oblige.The lines aren't as long as they seem, although expect to wait. Unless of course, you have a phone. Then call ahead, walk in, pay, and walk out. If you have a smartphone, Ike's has an app that allows you to place your order from said app and come in and pick it up. No wait!Honestly though, waiting at Ike's isn't all that bad. Their many awards line the walls, as well as an autographed photo of Adam Richman from when Ike's was featured on Man v. Food =] It's completely, absolutely worth the wait. Besides, with a free bag of chips accompanying every sandwich, you get to snack while anxiously awaiting your delicious--and it will be delicious, guaranteed--sandwich.Not to mention, they have one of the most expansive and interesting vegetarian sandwich menus in the city. Much appreciated!Get the blind date on sourdough with everything, if you're veg. You won't be disappointed.
Best subway/deli style sandwiches I've ever had, bar none. Great bread selection, topping selection, and fantastic ingredients. Put anything on dutch crunch, add mozarella sticks IN YOUR SANDWICH, and any of their delicious homemade dressings and you won't want to be anywhere else in all of San Francisco!!
Ike's Place needs another glowing review like I need a third nostril - but i'm going for it anyway.Love it. Have loved it. Will love it.The line during the busy hours (4:30 to 7:70 weeknights and essentially all day weekends) has grown to the point of insane. Yesterday it was actually 1/2 a city block long. But I get it, nobody makes a better sandwich and when you want an Ike's there is no substitute.Calling ahead is the way to go - then you only need to wait to pay and you're on your way. It makes the most time consuming part deciding what to get from the crazy-long menu.
My friend brought me in here telling me this was the heart of the world's best sandwiches. To be honest, I didn't believe her entirely but once my boyfriend and I made up our minds about the sandwich we wanted "Lex Luthor" we had high expectations. The line was long and packed, but nonetheless it was worth the wait. Just be sure to save some time for the wait or call in the order. Because this isn't the type of place to walk in and out of, there will be a line. I didn't like how the prices were not mentioned on the menu... The sandwich we ordered was $20! As expensive as it was, the sandwich was tasty, meaty and my whole mouth couldn't even fit around it. It was massive! If you want to challenge your neighborhood sandwich joint, stop at Ike's. The best thing about our visit though was that we got to meet the owner, Ike. He was really sweet and humble. I cant wait to visit Frisco again.
Shouts of "go make me a sandwich woman!!" will now be officially replaced by "hurry your ass up to Ike's woman!!"Ike's is that good. I can't explain how great it is except that he probably sprinkles crack in his sauce, or bakes his bread from crack dust.Thank you Ike's Place, for ending male hunger syndrome.Tip: either go during non-meal hours like 3-4pm-ish, or call in your order an hour before you want to eat. Yes, the line can get monstrous.
Ike is God sent. These sandwiches are loaded with tastiness! Nacho Girl: Bomb if you like salmon(name of the girl Ike's dating, I forgot): BombMy FAVE:Hollywood's SF CheesesteakEveryone there is super friendly and Ike is a sweetheart. Trrrrry it, you'll liiiiike it. No, LOVE it!
Pretty tasty sandwiches, especially the vegan ones- impressive! However, no way I would ever pay out this much $$ for a sandwich- just not worth it. But if you have the cash and are in the neighborhood, this is the place to go- everyone loves them, and they always have a line out the door. I second another reviewer's comment to make the sandwiches smaller and to not include chips for free and have that at a lower cost- I don't want chips, and don't need to eat a football-sized sandwich.
I went to Ike's twice this weekend (not the first time I have done this). Got the MILF on Saturday and We're Just Friends on Sunday. Both were fantastic as always. The ingredients are fabulous, plus you get free chips and a lollipop! Friendly staff too. As good as it gets!
BEST SANDWICH I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. and I am not exaggerating. There is a bit of a line, but it goes by fast, and it is so worth it!! I got the menage a trois, and that sandwich was by far theeeee BEST sandwich I have ever had. I am from the OC, CA and we have nothing that good out here like Ike's does. Went there on 7/20/12 around 1 or 2. The register lady, with the purple streak in her hair was really nice also. If you want to have the best sandwich of your life, go to Ike's Place. You will not regret it!!!!!
We've been here twice and had this review been written after our first visit this would have been a five-star review, but we are dinging Ike's one star because though the sandwiches here are awesome, not awesome enough to merit a wait of 1 hour after ordering. Given how popular this place is, we are surprised that they don't produce more sandwiches per hour. Hopefully when they get a permanent location, they can add more sandwich makers. Our tip: get there early. Our first time we showed up at 11 and got our sandwiches quickly. Our second trip we showed up at noon and got our sandwiches at 1:25. If you can't get there early, phone in your order.Restroom review: have not had the opportunity to try; will update when used.
Holy Cow!!! Saw this place on Man v. Food and had to try it. Let me tell you. It did not disappoint. We got the kryptonite and the mnage a trois. Delicious. Each sandwich came with a bag of chips. Can not wait to have another Ike's sandwich. The only downfall to this place was there was no where there to sit and eat. We found a bench around the corner at the school to sit and eat so all was not lost but just a bit of work to enjoy the sandwich.
I lah-oove this place! After having a sandwich at another shop that has great reviews but (to me) PALES in comparison, I had to review the awesomeness of this place, although the 2000+ reviewers have sufficiently done so. When I went, there were no tables to sit and eat your delicious sandwich so by the time my friend and I got to her place, the bread was a bit soggy, but I enjoyed every last bite of it. I forgot which ones we ordered, but they were both muy delicioso. So worth it. Wherever you're coming from... so worth it.
The trick is to win the VIP card from Ike via facebook or twitter and skip the line. Short of that, call it in or you'll be in line for 20 - 45 minutes. It is, as much as is possible, worth the wait and price. Best sandwich shop around.
I'm not a big fan of the sandwich, what with having grown up with piping hot plates of rice, dumplings, noodles, etc. The sandwich always seemed to be a paltry substitute to something warming and more filling. But even I have to say that Ike's sandwiches blew me away.Always get the dutch crunch with extra dirty sauce...sage advice...if you get a sandwhich with hot sauce or something overpowering...then you can't really taste the dirty sauce. But Nacho Boy sandwhich was awesome. I want to try other sandwhiches on the menu...and for any sandwich place to make me excited to go back, well that's pretty impressive.If you're a sandwich person, go ahead and give this place a try! Also love the fact there's a bunch of vegeterian options!
the best sandwich in sf and the world.
Seriously one of the best in the city. Kind of a treck out into the mission, or maybe it's the castro....haha somewhere in between....anyways it's worth it! The line gets long so be prepared.....but it's so worth the wait! AH my mouth is salivating, now I have to go get one!
If you like sandwiches...this is the place to be! Everything is good here!
Parking was a huge fucking disaster, but after I composed myself I ordered the menage a trois and it was like a little piece of heaven in my mouth. Would eat again. Will eat again.
I had a rough start with Ike's but have recently found my way. I hate mayo, so originally, I was ordering my sandwiches with "no mayo." Turns out, when you order your sandwich without mayo, they don't give you their infamous dirty sauce (except the sauce that they bake into the bread). Their sauce contains mayo, but you don't taste it much, and the sandwiches aren't the same without it! I like the "Say Hey" and the "Nacho Boy."Bad news: this place is known enough that there's almost always a line. Go early (before 11 am) or call in your order for pick up. Definitely worth a try though! I'm excited for my next visit!
Wow. I finally got a chance to dive into the wonderful world of an Ike's Place sandwich. I didn't really know what I was getting into, but as I pull up into a great parking spot a block away from the spot, I see my friends in waiting anxiously in line to place there order. I jump in with them and I can see the menu on the wall. That wasn't all though. Apparently there was a book of options to choose from so I pull out the iPhone while waiting in line to look at the rest. They all sounded really delicious, but I decided to go with the Superman.Roast Beef, Corned Beef, Pastrami, Salami, Turkey, Bacon, Ham, Avocado, and Jack. I didn't think it was possible to have so many different kinds of meats in one bite! That is what you call a sandwich. !We sat outside to finish the meal, even as it started to rain. Had to finish it as quickly as possible because I didn't want the weather to damage my whole wheat bread (yea...trying to be healthy...). There were a few other ones I wanted to try, but I had to restrain myself. Next time Ike, next time.
Okay, Okay- YES, this is the most awesomely delicious sub I've ever had. I finally succumbed to the peer pressure the other evening after scoring parking at 16th n' Market and remembered Ikes is right there.In a word, YummI had the Turkey w/Avocado, Bacon, etc...on Dutch crunch.In another word - WowWho knew such a simple sandwich concoction could taste like that!Go - give in to the peer pressure and the ridiculous cult like public obsession. I'm pretty sure you'll be glad you did.
Since moving to San Francisco last year, I've been searching for the city's best sandwich. My trip to Ike's Place finally put that long search to rest.Biting into the Montana to Rice sandwich--Ike's take on the classic meatball marinara--was heavenly. It was sweet yet savory, moist yet crunchy, and altogether amazing. The dutch crunch roll and dirty sauce are what makes this sandwich tops amongst a slew of so many other inferior meatball subs I've had in my lifetime. The fries were delicious, too--perfectly crisp and seasoned without being too oily. Bonus points for its super friendly staff and for the caramel apple lollipop at the end of the meal (brings me back to my middle school days)!This place isn't the highest reviewed restaurant on Yelp for no reason. By all means, this place earns it. I am definitely coming back to try some other favorites: the Superman, the M.I.L.F., the Nacho Girl, and the Mission P.Z. Burger to name a few.
Yup, I like Ike. His sandwiches are good and the service was as good as take-out can get. But, skip the line, call in your order and just swing by and pick it up.It was a particularly normal San Francisco Thursday afternoon -- overcast, cold, and windy -- when I went to Ike's. I got there well past what would be standard lunch time, somewhere around 2:30. I was hoping there wouldn't be a queue, but no such luck. Worse yet, I got stuck with a group of four boisterous, discourteous clods behind me. So, my 15 minute wait to order was not a happy time. Not Ike's fault, but did detract from the experience. I wonder what the line would be like on a nice day? In any case, like I said, save the time and the annoyance, call in your order.On the plus side, the gal manning the cash register was pretty amazing. As each group approached to order, she greeted them like they were long lost friends. She was patient, answering questions about sandwich fixings, beverages, Ike, and even Sonoma county. You'd think that at some point, taking sandwich orders would get boring, but she made the process look as exilerating as bungee jumping. And a few minutes after placing my order, my name was called and the taste test was on.The sandwiches all have fun names, which is a nice touch, but does make reading the menu closely a must. My pick was an SF Cheesesteak on a French roll. Excellent! The bun was toasted nicely, nice quality meat, a great ratio of provolone cheese to meat, and a few hot peppers to add some bite. Yum. After engulfing the first half of my sandwich, I finally looked in the bag for napkins and found a caramel-apple chew. I didn't eat it, but it was a nice, unexpected surprise. Thanks Ike.
The hangover cure for a crazy and alcohol-fueled saturday night is...Sunday FUNday! this included a relaxing morning walk through Crissy Fields and the Presidio followed an amazing lunch at IKE'S (and dessert at Bi-Rite)!For my first time here, I tried the "Name of the Girl I'm Dating". I'm not much of a hot sandwich fan BUT Ike's changed all that! This was the best hot sandwich I've had so far for the following reasons: 1) The Halal chicken is perfection! i The flavorful chicken is shredded so you're not biting into a huge chunk of chicken that just ends up tasting super bland 2) The sourdough bread was freshly baked...soft yet firm and crispy and crunchy on the outside. It wasn't like other breads where you literally have to tear the bread with your teeth and maul your sandwich apart 3) the yummy yummy overdose of sauce!My friend and had the "Paradise Found", which we both agreed was pretty good too.Also, Ike greeted us and was super friendly and talked to us about his new location in Redwood City...Can't wait to check the new location out as well as come back to SF for another yummy sandwich...Thanks Ike's!!!
GIGANTIC ASS SANDWICHES!!!!!!! I would always get the Eli Manning! IDK if it's een on the menu anymore, but it was so damn good! Can never finish a whole sandwich on my own in one sitting though lol.....sharing is caring.
Well worth the:walkwait in linethe feeling of being crowded because it's a small store frontprice per sandwich.....$9 (I know)the time you'll spend contemplating which one you want to munch onThere are so many sandwich ads posted up on the walls that I got the feeling there could possibly be a secret menu only known to the elite Ike's aficionado. This menu might only exist in my mind, but hey, it could be possible.I love the sandwich combinations. There's a sandwich called the Backstabber made with chicken and artichokes. While I don't completely get how the sandwiches and their names connect - I love the results.It's a nice place to people watch too. You can see lots of neighborhood peeps from the Castro drop by, eat outside with a nice bottled beverage and mile high sandwich. It's a very relaxing experience and I can't wait to go back.
Why are these sandwiches so good and addicting? I think it's a combination of their sauces and fresh bread. I don't even care that there are no places to sit, no tables and the line is always out the door. These sandwiches are legit. The Manage A Trois is perfect, just the way it is. It's sweet and savory but not overwhelming. I ordered this the first time and every time I've come to Ike's and it never disappoints. The addition of the caramel apple sucker they give you with every sandwich is icing on the cake; and a pretty damn good cake too. Figuratively speaking of course.
Ike's definitely deserves the hoopla that it gets. You might question the wait time that got up to forty minutes for us the first time we went, but stop. Set aside a lunchtime, take a longer lunch break, or heck, take the whole day off just to experience an Ike's sandwich.Try calling in to place your order, but we called the entire way there, and the phone line was still busy even after we arrived, so we decided to wait in line. Grab a friend to go with you in case this happens, or just chat up the other people in line who also know that this is the best sandwich to have in San Francisco.I had the Nacho Boy Supreme the last time I went, but ignore all suggestions and let the menu grab your attention.
Ike's is good but way too much sauce on their sandwiches, which kind of just makes it a bunch of mush. So far the Thanksgiving sandwich is the winner. I prefer Rhea's on Valencia.
As a craftsman of some of the finest sandwiches to walk the planet, I knew I had to stop by Ike's and see what all the hype was about. Plus, if Matt Cain tells me to go try a place, I have no choice, but to oblige. It's great to see small, Mom and Pop businesses like Ike's with their specials on handwritten signs and local flair. I didn't have a chance to try it, but I'd have to say the best menu item was the #55 (a signed Tim Lincecum turkey, avocado special!)! Instead of the #55, I opted for the Joan of Arc (halal chicken breast, brie, avocado and french sauce) on Dutch Crunch. I'm a total carb girl, so I fell in love with the bread immediately. As for its accompaniments, I'd have to say it was just all right. The sauciness was a little overpowering, but overall, it was a unique combo that I can't say I've seen anywhere else. I would never doubt any advice given by a Giant's ace, and now I can say I've been to one of Matty's favorite joints. Perhaps if I was on a multimillion dollar contract, I'd feel better about a $9 sandwich. In reality, this non-multimillionaire will stick with her other deli staples in SF.
File this under "why didn't anybody tell me sooner?". I think we just may have a new SF sandwich champion, and I've been to plenty of corner markets by now. But who else has such a selection (quite overwhelming on your first time, in fact--I went for the Cristina & Umair), and who else delivers such spine-tingling levels of flavor? (Must be the Dirty Sauce). If the other reviews didn't clue you in, ordering here should not be taken lightly or impatiently, as prep time is (justifiably) long and seating limited to a few sidewalk table. I called in a weekday lunch order then showed up on my bike 20 minutes later, and that worked like a charm. Of course, by the time I biked back the sandwich had steamed itself a bit soggy, but its deliciousness shined through anyway. I'd heard good things about the fries too, but they turned out to be fairly unremarkable jojo potatoes. Best to keep your whole meal on an extra-high note and go for the pure sandwich experience.
The dirty sauce is delicious worth the wait!You can also call in your order ahead of time and show up when they tell you your order will be ready...
I'm kinda addicted to the Jessica Rabbit sandwich. soooo tasty. all my favorite things in one bite (vegan breaded chicken, stuffed jalapeno poppers, franks red hot, ranch). I'm still not too happy about paying $12 for it but once in a while it's fine. I always wounder if they make their own jalapeno poppers or if they are frozen ones....
Ike's Place is awesome! They are super fast for the amount of people that are usually ordering and their sandwich's are incredibly diverse and they all sound so good. I had the Napoleon Complex. It was perfect.If you love this place, make sure you visit soon to sign their petition. Apparently they are getting evicted for noise, which makes no sense. I hope this place lasts cause it is too good to disappear!
Best sandwich ever, blah blah blah.Orgasm in a meal, blah blah blah.So worth it, blah blah blah.So just flippin go to Ike's, like these other 500 people have suggested. Enjoy every bit of the best sandwich you'll have in SF. And then walk home, because you're going to need it.Nacho Boy was a great foray into the magic of Ike's: hot roast beef, cheese, mushrooms, avocado and all the veggies on a wheat roll. The aioli sauce was a perfect signature touch, and the guy at the register made sure I understood that it was mayo-based, but not mayo (i.e. delicious and not disgusting). Why don't more sandwich joints have a wheat roll? Slices are slowly becoming the new bane of my deli existence, but Ike's cleared that hurdle no problem.A smidge more expensive than the average, but this ain't average goods: two giant sandwiches and two sodas cost us a bit over $20.Ike's does come with negatives. It does take a while; we got in before the Sunday lunch crowd and still had to wait about 10-15 mins. But have a seat, go with someone you actually like talking to and the wait will go by in a snap.Bonus: free caramel apple pops!Cinco estrellas, baby!
Just reporting in on my personal Ike's quest. Tried the Backstabber yesterday. It's got chicken, artichoke hearts, some kind of cheese (I forget), caesar dressing, garlic bread, and they offered and I accepted pesto.Another one of those reviews that's hard to write because my keyboard is covered in Pavlovian slobber. And I just ate breakfast, so I shouldn't be hungry. Ugh, I HATE how much I LOVE Ike's.
Ike's definitely gets the 5 star rating. All of their sandwiches are amazing. You can't go wrong with choosing any of them. Fresh. Hot. Quality ingredients. Huge portions. Decently priced.I would suggest going their when they just open or calling in your order, or you're going to be waiting for a while. But it's worth the wait, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours.... Worth it! There's limited outdoor seating and only out door seating.I like that Ike himself gave me my sandwich. :)Found this place watching Man Vs. Food.
Don't believe the hype! DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE! so in that case, there wouldn't be a line the next time I visit lol! Everytime I go here, there's always a good 15-30 minutes wait and when I try to make a phone order, I'm always told that my sandwiches won't be ready within 2-3 hours? WHHHHHHHHY? But damn the sandwiches are good. Everything on the menu is scrumptious and if you don't know which one to get, just ask the register person what to recommend. The staff are very helpful, friendly and did I mention that the sandwiches are good?The Dirty Sauce that is baked with the bread makes it unbelievably, delectably, heavenly appetizing. Heck, try it yourself. By the way, I took a star off because of the inconvenience (sorry Ike and Nacho Boy) and good luck on finding parking.
OH. MY. GOD. i would hate to typecast this place as being great hangover food, but honestly... it hits the spot. from the shredded chicken and special sauce to the dutch crunch bread. sooo sooo good. i knocked them a star because i need a place to sit and enjoy this goodness, it's too hot and juicy to last a car/bus/taxi ride home. would a table or two on the sidewalk be against the law? i'd help them apply for a permit if that's what the need.
I'm pretty picky and a 5 star rating from me is very rare, but oh man, Ike's is magical. The sandwiches are like heaven on bread and Ike is a really cool guy. If you're in the area, you'd be sorry to miss out on all this. All of the hundreds of sammiches are equally as amazing as the last. I'm partial to the Hot Momma, The name of the girl I'm dating, and of course, the Menois a Trois. I once waited almost 2 hours (during Pride one year) for a sandwich. My time is very precious, but I was not upset about it in the least. TOTALLY worth the wait.
Yum, yum, yum! This place has more than exceeded my expectations on what a sandwich place should be. My love and I love to share the Kryptonite, so freaking good!
Yes, it's worth lining up for! Lined up just in time to beat the lunch crowd. We all got the Hollywood on dutch crunch roll, along with a bag of dirty chips and a soda. All I can say is that it was all that they say it was, and more! The next time we go I'll try #108 "Do you smell what Barack is cooking?"
Just like the dude said...."how good can a sandwich really be??!!" Pretty damn good!!! We got the Kryptonite which was 4 big pounds of just about everything! I can't even recall what was in it anymore. It was insane. Extremely messy while attempting to eat, but oh so good.The Menage a Trois is also really good. Ordered it on dutch crunch with Halal chicken breast, honey mustard bbq, pepperjack swiss and smoked gouda...yum!The only negative is that the line is just way too freakin LONG!! We waited almost an hour in line and then another 45 minutes just to get our food! Ridiculous.But I'll be back.....after calling in my orders instead.
For the no-frills place with the great sandwich, this is a great bet. You walk into a closet-sized space, order your sandwich then hang around the door until they call your name. You can join the youngish, hipster crowd eating at the tables or sitting on the sidewalk, or take your food away. The dirty sauce is the key here...hint...garlic and fat. It's delicious.The only reason this place doesn't get five stars in my book is that there was a little too much of the distraction flavors. Everything tasted really good, toasty and garlicky, but I could only detect the flavor of the protein I was paying the big money for once in a while.
so thank you yelpers for the tip to phone first. walked right past the super long line out the door, grabbed our sandwiches and ate them in the car. hubby had the Damon bruce, what a great sized sandwich and when hubby stops talking and drinking soda, its a good sandwich! I had the menage a trois. that had so much flavor! and the bread, got to get the crunchy bread (cant think of name right now) but its a must. so we are completely hooked on Ikes and have to come back everytime we come into town. Why isnt there one in Illinois?! whine, whine whine....
I'm giving a 4 star review only because the girl taking my order suggested I add sriracha in my "Going Home for Thanksgiving" sandwich (turkey, cranberry sauce, havarti) and it was such a great addition. The sriracha mixed with the cranberry made for a delicious spicy sweet sauce and took the sandwich to a whole other level. But come on guys, it's not the meat in the sandwiches that make it so delicious. Let's be honest here.. its the mayo-based "dirty sauce" that you all love. And granted, its a good sauce, but I'd hate to give Ike's a 5 star rating based on the sauce!I do have to give Ike's credit for having such variety. The creativity exuding from this place is just off the charts.
Ike's Place has the best most flavorful sandwiches in the city hands down. For those who can handle overwhelming flavor, Ike's is the ultimate SF lunch treat for you! Although the owner, Ike, is both a bit creepy and annoying, the sandwiches are simply unbeatable, even with the most hilarious titles such as, my all time favorite sandwich, 'The Name of the Girl I'm Dating'. With not 1, not 2, but 3 fully stocked menus to satisfy all of the picky vegetarian, vegan and carnivore sandwich enthusiasts in SF, Ike's place has truly set the bar for sandwiches in the city, giving every other deli a run for their money. The extensive menu always leaves customers with the chance to come back and try something new. And the additional Dirty chips and carmel apple lollypop is a nice touch to end the experience on a sweet note. The staff is always friendly and kind, making Ike's place a enjoyable place to be, even when the line is out the door. I would have to say that because Ike's is so popular they should really get a new location for their 16th St. spot because it does not support the capacity of customers, nor does it allow people to sit and enjoy their sandwiches, but instead has them shooed out the door to eat their sandwich elsewhere. It is for this reason that I give Ike's 4 stars and not 5. Change this small detail and you have a perfect location on your hands!
Finally made it to Ikes Place today...and it is definitely a destination that I would recommend to friends and visitors to SF. Love that Ike actually hands you your sandwich. I hear he is opening new locations this year and hope that he is considering Fillmore or Polk.I called a head of time to pre-order and was told that it would be less of a wait if I just waited in line. I had my sandwich (can other reviewers please refrain from the word "sammich": its annoying and I won't take you seriously) within 40 minutes of arriving...perfect was anticipating a much longer wait.So i think i ordered wrong...don't get me wrong the dirty CA roll was delicious...but no one told me I could add jalapeno poppers TO my sandwich. So next time I'm going that route.My advice would be call a couple of hours before you want to eat, drive on down and pick it up instead of dealing with the lines. (also for the parking whiners....I saw 3 spaces within a block and used to live in that neighborhood and find it actually quite easy to park)I'll likely give it 5 stars when I order the jalapeno poppers inside my sandwich...that sounds ridiculously amazing!
Cheap, good location, and a large variety of different, but creative sandwiches. Interesting names to go along with the sandwiches.Definitely a repeat customer, if you just tried once =)But beware, it is a long wait for some bomb ass sandwiches.
So we are on the search for the best sandwiches in SF and this spot, thanks to Yelp, was on our list to try. Granted we still haven't tried all the places, but Ike's is one of the bests so far!!I have to admit, I was kind of intimidated when we first got there. A line outside along w/ the cash register (??), not knowing how to order: there's SO many to choose from (though I love all the names), not knowing what condiments come on the sandwich besides the "dirty sauce", and are we just supposed to walk in to get our drinks??The lady taking our order was kind of friendly: nice smile, polite, but didn't seem overly anxious to help the newbies out. Didn't tell us they were having a special on their drinks that day (overheard it when she told other patrons after we ordered), but was nice enough to have another worker search for the chips we wanted.So we order, and wait a good 15 minutes for our sandwiches, there were a lot of ppl waiting so we knew we were gonna be waiting a while. There's two tables outside so not a lot of places to enjoy your sandwich there, but a group of four were leaving so we took the table and were obliging when another patron wanted to share the table w/ us. Our "new friend" seemed friendly...he shared w/ us that the "dirty sauce" is baked into the breads, and also informed us of the Man vs Food sandwich (which I've already forgotten the name of) but it was interesting info.All in all, I would definitely come back here again because the sandwiches are so good!! Though i'd most likely call ahead of time and not plan on eating there since there's no where to sit. But then again, I'm not sure our digestive systems loved the "dirty sauce" as much as we did. =/
Ike's PlaceWhat We had: the Change; the Super Mario w/extra dirty sauce.Wait : just over 45 minutes to order and then an additional 20 for the sandwiches to arrive.Service: Could be 5 stars on its own. These people are quite possibly the most chipper humans i've ever come across, that work in the service industry. Ike personally delivered our sandwiches to us. Food: the change was delicious, the cheese was melted perfectly and the sandwich was packed with yumminess.Super Mario: also very good, meatballs were super tasty. the sauce was very good and the mozzarella sticks were the perfect compliment.Verdict: Although the sammies were good, we both said that there were almost too many flavors going on. I cant say these are the best sandwiches i've ever eaten(i'm from florida and Publix/hungry bear subs are better), nor can i say this was the best sandwich i've eaten in san francico(i think roxie's might be on par and the wait is usually only 10 minutes). But they were hella good. I'm not sure an hour wait is worth it though. I might go back because the service is so good and they do have a lot of options.I would however suggest trying it at least once, just for the experience. AND GET THE DIRTY SAUCE!
delicious sandwiches. so many different varieties. from 9$ to 22$
When I was seven years old, I watched The Going My Way for the first time. Right then and there, I decided that I wanted to be a priest when I grew up. because I hated girls, they were really mean bitches.Fortunately, one day I grew up and discovered female-nude and "get laid", and of course, 7 Samurais, agnosticism, and much later, Bill Maher and Borack.When I was sixteen, I saw a movie calls Madam Emanuelle, since then, for a little while, I prefered white meat.I had my last bite of red meat that spring, when I traveled to visit a Okinawan friend in Osaka, Japan. Her brother cooked us an amazing dish called Buta-Kimchee--a Black roast pork mixed with kimchee. It was the perfect proverbial bang with which to go out of the world of red meat. Or so I thought...until many years later, when I moved to San Francisco, and learned of pastrami. *unpure thoughts about pork* About Ike's place.My last visit was 11 month ago.Man, time goes really fast.So, I took my son because he hasn't been here yet.It was friday, 3:30pm.There was a line, but now, Ike has 4 people working for him.I ordered Pastrami, " say hey!", my son got a vege thing.We sat down out side and talking, it was a great day out, we didn't mind waiting at all but It took them about 10 minutes this time.And the sandwich was just GREAT!!!!Ike came out and chat with us a bit.He told us that he has over 150 different combinations now!Dark meat, white meat and Vege, I don't care, eat what ever you want.But I like them all at Ike's place.P.S., 1st few lines are exactry same as Tasad's review. I couldn't help copying it.yelp.com/biz/sinaloa-bur
YUMMMMAZINGThey have a ton of extra sandwiches that are not on the board. Ask for the book!And get your sammy on Dutch Crunch. Also, totally worth the wait.Staff is badass :)
I went to Ike's on 16th in SF. It was my first time there. The line move quickly. I ordered a Matt Cain nothing to drink. The girl at the register told me it was $10.86 and I gave her a $20 bill. She gave me back a bunch of singles and change. I tipped a dollar and folded the rest up and put it in my pocket. My mistake because I didn't count it. When I did count it there was only 5 dollars. which meant she had only given $6 instead of $9. The sandwich was good but count your change!
OK, so I feel like I'm a pretty prissy sandwich bitch in my own kitchen. Being a single guy, a lot of time I make some super kick ass...though usually labor intensive...sandies to satisfy some muchies going on. It takes a lot to make me this impressed with a sandwich (Subs Inc. in Noe Valley did a damn respectable job too...http://www.yelp.com/biz/subs-inc-san-francisco)This place is pretty mind bending. Like, seriously...how can a sandwich really get this good? I don't know what kind of special gooeyness they drop on that lovelyness, but it tastes like a smurf orgy in my mouth (thats a good thing). This is a sweet place for some grab and go. Shit...I can feel extra pounds getting added to my ass as we speak :). For reference, I had the Al Bundy...delish, but it looks like there are a million other awesome things to eat. Which brings me to the top 3 killer things you must know about this place:1) Read the menu online before you go. There are a *lot* (I mean, like 200) of options, and if you wait to decide while you're there it will take you 20 minutes.2) Out of the above 200 sandos above, about half are vegetarian...wow. Mad props!3) There is like 0 seating here. There are a couple or 3 tables outside, but thats it. You may freeze your ass off if you go here for dinner expecting indoorsy seating. My recommendation? Buy a sandie and hit up Toronado in the Haight (yelp.com/biz/toronado-sa) to wash it down with beer names that sound like they are from a heavy metal album cover. They don't care if you bring in outside food there.
I've been here two times. Two times I ordered the Change, which is steak with barbecue sauce and onion rings. Two times I ordered it on Dutch Crunch. Two times they had to replace the steak with roast beef because they were out. Two times it still tasted like steak.Two times I wish I could re-live. I heard they're moving.
oh MAN. I am a sandwich freak and Ike's makes me feel all KINDS of freaky. I had the # 59 "Cristina and Umair Go to Ike's Place" which has turkey, bacon, ham, salami, Italian dressing, avocado, provolone. Sounds wild, right? uhhhhh because it IS. Go to IKE's! For the lady who passed by me while I stood in the long line who said "whatever. this place isn't even that good," I gotta say girrrrrrrrrrrrl quit playin. FYI: order ahead and just pick it up. Even after ordering (standing in line), it takes a while. There are also a total of 2 tables.
Wait that would have sucked had it not been a warm night, with good company, AND scored tables - 3 starsTable service - 5 starsPaul Reuben on dutch crunch with everything on it - 4.5 starsExtremely disappointing chai cola - 0 stars, but I won't count itSuper friendly manager (think his name is Alex) - 5 starsLetting us wash our hands in the sink behind the counter - 5 starsOkay, I'm bad at math so I don't even know what that averages to. I'm just gonna give this place 5 stars.
Lincecum, Menage a Trois, Sabrina's Smile, all great sandwiches but there's still over 60 different flavors to try from. (Dutch Crunch is the best bread IMO) Parking is meh. It's the mission district. Eagerly awaiting for the SF State location to open.
Order: (Name of Girl I'm Dating) on a dutch roll, with everything on it. Halal Chicken Breast, Honey Mustard, Avocado, Pepper Jack $7.97I have never had so many delicious flavors dance around in my mouth. The chicken was shredded and the bread was perfectly toasted. Hands down, the best sandwich you can find in San Francisco. Yes, there was a long line all the way out the door, but it only took 15 minutes. WELL WORTH THE WAIT! Also, Ike is so cute! Great hospitality!!note: It's the kind of sandwich you should eat within 30 minutes, since it runs the risk of becoming soggy.
WOW! THE PERFECT SANDWICH SHOP!That "Woohoo! As good as it gets!" caption up top does Ike's an injustice. It simply isn't descriptive enough. If there's any sandwich spot that can come close to the dedication, helpings and friendliness that Ike's has, then it should be called IKE's!Anyways, my wife and I have been here twice. Can you guess how we heard of it? MAN V. FOOD. 'Nuff said. We've been to two of the three spots featured on there. This happened to be the first. The first time we went, I already knew what I wanted: THE KRYPTONITE! It was featured on MAN V. FOOD, and it was said to be a challenge just to take the first bite out of. Good enough for me. The line wasn't that bad, it did go pretty quick, and I noticed the names of the sammies. "Tim Lincecum." "Mark Sanchez." "Sopranos." The cute, descriptive names kept going on and on. Even the "Barry Zito" looked appetizing.The first time we went, they still sold salads, but the second time around (which was about 6 months later) they stopped selling them. Apparently the Chinese Chicken Salad wasn't a big seller. After all, this was IKE'S PLACE!Set in a quiet, homely neighborhood on the outskirts of the Castro, Ike's is definitely one of those places that will always be crowded because it's just soooooo good there!
Their sandwiches are creative, but this place gets way more hype than it deserves. Yes, the staff is SUPER FRIENDLY, but if we're strictly rating the sandwiches, I give them two stars.
mmmmmmmm. Hands Down, THE BEST SANDWICHES in the city! I was never a big lover of sandwiches, but I've gotten addicted to them because of Little Lucas in South San Francisco. So, when I started searching for a great sandwich place in San Francisco itself.. I found Ikes from all of your great reviews.. Thanks fellow yelpers! I don't even know which one I like better now.. they are different but equally amazingly delicious. The guys working there were so helpful and friendly. They have hundreds of sandwiches and its hard to decide while your squeezing your way into the place and watching the already-made sandwiches go by looking so delicious. The guy at the register was very friendly and suggested what other sandwiches we might like or what's good to add to our sandwiches. The guy bringing our sandwiches (and lollipop - good surprise!) to us outside was really friendly and had a great memory for names too. They really make you feel comfortable and welcome. And the SANDWICHES ARE SO MESSY AND DELICIOUS!
I was obviously not that excited because of San Francisco tendency to overhype stuff that would be considered normal somewhere else.But after it almost closed yesterday and moved to the Peninsula, I decided to finally check Ike's Place.And I have to say that was wrong, this sandwich (a Legend of Zelda on dutch crunch) is one hella decadent sandwich. Dirty, massive and overly satisfying. Ordered at 11AM on the phone, got the sandwich at 1PM, ate in the sun at Duboce. I was wrong and I will probably come back.
I bet you all when the workers going home they just smoke weed and think about what new ingredients they can add to their sandwiches. Then, they throw in a random, yet clever, name for their new creation.That's what makes Ike's Place so awesome, all the thought they put into it. Everything from the bomb diggity dirty sauce to the random lolipop they give out with each sandwich. Their sandwiches are an adventure. My favorite is the Mission PZ Burger.
Hands down the best sandwiches in the city - the best part is how friendly everyone is there. From the cashier to Ike, who everytime I've been there walked my sandwich out and said "thank you". Definitely get the dutch crunch when you order your sandwich!If you go with friends, and do not magically find quick parking, I would drop one of them off to stand in line for you and/or the group as the driver finds parking -- the lines can get long!
Anyone who know me knows that I do not eat sandwiches. I don't understand a sandwich and can't seem to get behind eating meat thatis sliced so thin that it doesn't look like the piece of meat it came from. My twin took me to Ike's for the first time and I must say that it was scrumdeleiscious! The sandwich was sloppy with all the condiments and the meat was juicy...I had something with a chicken breast. It was super delicious! My son had the peanut butter and jelly sandwich and it was the best thing since sliced bread too. It was a huge sandwich for a kid but he enjoyed the half of the half that he could eat. Will definitely go back!
The Skinny - long lines and waits, exceptionally long menu list, friendly environment and workers, and some of the best damn food ever. You won't be disappointed.The Details - I lived in SF for about 4 years and I didn't come to Ike's Place until after my 3rd year ... such a shame. This place has something for everyone; meat lovers, veggie lovers, sauce lovers, cheese lovers, the whole nine yards. Avoid the lines and long waits by coming during off hours (but know that waiting is also part of the experience). The folks who work behind the counter are great and can help you out if you're not sure what to order. My personal favorite is the MILF, a little bit of spice and sweetness to go along with the dirty sauce, it's delicious. Can't say much else except go try it if you're ever in SF; go out of your way to stop by and check it out. *Salivating just at the thought of this place.The Major Pros- Great tasting food with a lot of variety and options- Affordable prices, especially for the quality of food you get- Friendly and helpful staff; the man himself, Ike, hand delivers your meal to you when your order is ready ... A+The Really Minor Cons (if there were any)- The wait during busy hours (not really a major con considering the wait actually makes your meal taste better)The Verdict - One of a kind gourmet sandwich joint, where the people are friendly and the food is amazing. Like I said, if you haven't already, go check this place out.
ahhhh how can you live in SF and not come here? this place is already super famous, i saw adam eating that sandwich on man vs food...i was here the first day they opened a block up from where they at now, i dont have to say a lot about this place cause ppl already know wuhsup, i finally got the kryptonite last week (i cant do the superman challenge, that shit is too much, i saw this fatguy chowing down this once, mind was blown), its a bit expensive id say for a sandwich but ull know where that money went when u take that first bite!4 stars
I stood in line in the pouring rain for this stuff..that's exactly how good their sandwiches are! I got their Hollywood's SF cheesesteak. It's soo yummy! I ordered it with the works which comes with their house dirty sauce, onions, pickles, banana peppers, and tomato (if you like it) on a toasted wheat roll. This also comes with their avocado whch I think makes all the difference.There is also a line for this regardless of what time you show up. As you inch closer to the cashier to put in your order/pay, you can see all these guys inside assembling sandwiches and smell the fresh baked rolls coming out of the door. There are menus being passed up and down the line as you wait. The locals get upset if you take up precious time ordering or changing your indecisive selections. Ou pay after ordering and just stand around until they call your name for pick up. There's no tables or chairs outside the store, so i just ate in the car. Just make sure you have lots of napkins. But one important side note, THEY TAKE PHONE ORDERS! I didn't know about this until I was literally getting soaking wet standing in the rain waiting to order this yummy goodness.
Big Meat w/ Dirty Sauce. Gotta love the Castro.This $9 premium sandwich contained enough cold cuts for a week. Dirty sauce was good. I tried to order the sandwich without, but got scolded. Thank you.It's basically what Quizno's would taste like in heaven.I am saving up for the Destroyer or whatever it is called, the 15 dollar sandwich with everything plus a bunch of fried shit on top.
After hearing the hype about this place, my friend and I decided to drive up to SF to try this amazing sandwich place where you have to wait 2 hours... In my head, I'm wondering if it's really *that* good.When we got there.. there was, of course, a line.. which was expected. But being prepared.. we got there around 4ish, which is after their busy rush time. Luckily, it was a nice day so the wait wasn't too miserable. But I will comment on one thing that annoyed me. Being an EX smoker.. I really DO NOT appreciate people who smoke in line. If you gotta smoke.. move the HELL away from the line. It was rude. Even when I was a smoker, I *never* smoked in line... But that's not the fault of the sandwich shop.. I'm just throwing that comment out there... I was expecting at least a 2 hour wait.. and it was actually only 30 minutes or so for us to order our sandwich, yay us. I ordered the #55 Lincecum (Go Giants!) with jalapeno poppers on dutch crunch and my friend ordered the #59 Cristina and Umair go to Ike's Place on dutch crunch. Then we stepped off the to the side to wait for our sammich. In about 20 minutes.. our name was called and we grabbed the sammiches and made a run for it... We hunkered down somewhere and excitedly unwrapped our sammich.. I took my first bite slowly to savor the flavors.. and it.. was.. AMAZING.. I've never been much of a sandwich person (c'mon...bread, meat.. how special could it be).. BUT THIS SAMMICH.. was just wonderful. The bread was so fresh and crunchy yet soft.. not one bit chewy to a point it's hard to bite through... everything was sliced thinly so you can bite through cleanly without a struggle.. Ahh, I could go on describing.. but I won't. Just go and experience it for yourself!Verdict: Mind blowing WINNAR... a MUST GO when in SF. I will try the other locations and see if they fare just as well as the original.. :P
This is the only sandwich place that I've been where I don't get the same thing every time I go.No matter how good the sandwich I ordered last time was, I refuse to get the same one. There are so many different varieties to choose from and you can always kick it up a notch by throwing in some mozzarella sticks, bacon, or even some jalapeno poppers. There is no reason to even think about going anywhere else unless you are more of a cafe person and enjoy a little cup of tea with a boring sandwich while you read the paper. The only flaw I would have to say would be the wait. Since Ike's rise to fame, you can expect to wait up to 2 hours in line same even if you call it in. I'll leave you with a couple of my personal favorite sandwiches.. - Tony Soprano w/ mozzarella sticks- Fat Bastard- Barry B- Backstabber - menage-a-trois
Gotta try the Dirty Sauce.It's mayo...with garlic, herbs, etc...their secret recipe.Whatever is their secret recipe, it provides a good kickin' for the sandwiches.Portion-wise, good. Luckily i got there right when they just opened the store so unlike previous reviews in which they had to deal with the horrendous long line to get their sammie(s), I was lucky enough to not wait long.Ordered the "We're JUST friends". Delicious. Will be back another time.
I am still dreaming about our first visit to this place. I thought that 20 people in the back might be a bit over kill. Yeah they need that and more to cover the monster lines that form all day long. The lines are worth the wait through this is hands down the best sandwich place I have ever visited. Small Wonder they are packed even though Google Places had their address listed wrong as of a few months ago. Menage De Trois is amazing try it out.
After seeking advice from Yelp, I decided I needed an Ike's sandwich. I sent my husband out to get it (four blocks away). It took an hour and twenty minutes. I thought his scooter got plowed down by an angry SUV driver. Apparently he was fine, but Ike's has a REALLY long line (over an hour). My sandwich ("strawberry girl" with no mushrooms, add avacado) was worth waiting an hour (it would have been even it I was the one that had to wait in line). It was really delicious (in a messy but perfect way). Often I am sad that I am vegetarian because other people's meaty food looks so much better than my veggie option. But sometime I find someplace that reminds me that being a vegetarian doesn't always suck. Ike's is one of those places. Thank you Ike for reminding me that vegetarianism doesn't always suck. I needed that.
MmmmMMMM.  Ike's Place is a great addition to complete my trilogy of "heavenly" Vegan-friendly sandwich shops. It fits in well with my other 2 favorites - Love N Haight and Jay's Cheesesteak - although I think those other 2 are a bit better when you add Vegenaise to them. Only a bit though. B-P The wait is long, yes. We waited probably 30 minutes for our freshly made sandwich with freshly baked bread. Possibly due to the crowds, the service is a bit too much on the New York-frenzy speed for my taste but imagine how long it would take if it wasn't. :) I guess I'm bit more of a laid-back Californian but in this case, with those crowds, I'd probably act more like a New York spazz too. No offense to the Ike's staff. :)Both the sandwiches I tried - Vegan Meatless Mike and Vegan Backstabber - were fabulous! The Vegan Meatless mike was a fake meatball sandwich with soy cheese, which was quite tasty but slightly goopey (is that a word?). Maybe I was more in the mood for it but the Vegan Backstabber, a Vegan turkey, Artichoke Hearts, Soy Cheese, was very fresh and tasty and lit up my sandwich delight sirens. What Ike's Place has over the other 2 sandwich shops I listed on the Axis of Vegan Seitanis is that Ike's carries vegan soy mayo and cheese. I would have given Ike's 5-stars if it had a completely vegan menu since I have changed my rating methodology to only give 5-stars for purely Veggie/Vegan restaurants. That sure would cut down on the crowds probably. B-PThank you Ike for providing such great Vegan sandwiches! I'll be back!
Ordered the Kryptonite from Man vs. Food, fed 4 people. Enjoyed it a lot, will definitely eat here again next time i'm in town.
Ike's sandwiches are too small? Really? If you believe this, WALK to the Subway at the corner of Market and 17th and get a friggin' footlong. We eat too much in this country as it is, ignoring the free lollypop!My only complaint is that it's infested with hipsters and now tourists that make Ike's team way too busy. I can't wait for the buzz to die down so I can come by more often and enjoy my favorite sandwich more often. Thanks Ike!!
all their sandwiches are really good, but I would recommend sharing it with someone cause they are heavy.
The food is good, but not amazing. Most important of all imo, the food is NOT worth an hour + wait. I bought The Catch w/onions, lettuce, tomato, jalapeno. The meatballs were small and sparse on the French roll. Because I didn't order all the crap extras to make the sandwich appear big, (e.g., frozen zucchini sticks, frozen poppers, frozen onion rings, etc.) you could see how sparse the sandwich really is. "Where's the beef?!?" was echoing in my head as I ate. With a bottle of water, it was more than $10. No thanks!Having to wait an hour to order at the door, then wait another 10-15 minutes next to parked cars for the sandwich to be made? Fergittit. Inside is tiny. How does a business owner decide to create a four-page menu without the space to store food/supplies (per one of the staff) much less the space to prepare the volume of sandwiches ordered each day ... to say nothing of having space for customers to stand inside or eat onsite?I tried Ike's Place after hearing about the eviction and all the customer support on the news. Perhaps all the whoopla got my expectations up too high. The food is good, but it's definitely not worth an hour plus wait. Hopefully, the locations on the Peninsula are a better match for the business needs.P.S. If you call Ike's before 10:00 AM, you can order your food and pick it up later. That'll save you an hour.* This review was written a week before it closed on 16th Street. The restaurant has relocated.
Simply the best sandwich I've ever had. Juicy, flavorful, and crazy tasting! I've only had it twice and got 2 different sandwiches, but I definitely want to eat here more often!
great sandwiches.. i have to admit, i read the reviews and was intrigued.. While i feel they are a little expensive even with the chips and lollipops, which btw are awesome!both sandwiches are very tasty. we did not experience a line as we were there at 11:30. On our next stop in San Francisco, not sure if i'll go back only because of the prices.. $11.00 for sandwich and chips is a little much..
I can't believe that I grew up in San Francisco and never tried this place until now! Worth all the hype. Unbelievable sandwiches.I got the Menage a Trois but also tasted the Jim Rome and would recommend both.
I have said it before and I'll say it again. You want to get into my pants? There are just a few food options that will make that happen. Chicken is one of them. And now so is the Hot Mamma Huda...the chicken sandwich with Frank's Red Hot Sauce, Ranch, Provolone and all the fixings. Just feed me one of those sandwiches and I'll gladly be more amiable to some friendly action. Damn...I'm still thinking of that sandwich. Drool....
Ike's Place is overrated... my friend took me to this place because we wanted to try it out. The menu was creative and I expected a lot from the menu... but all I got was microwaved chicken shreds in my sandwich... I was not impressed with the microwave, esp the chicken shreds... Honestly, I don't understand what's the craze about. I'm open to try new things and search for what's unique and creative, but Ike just reminds me of a place who just has a creative menu, but lacks good taste in the sandwich.
Finally got to try this place after hearing and reading about this place. I got there at 1ish, and the wait was not that long. About 15 minutes to order and get my sandwich, which I considered good after hearing about absurd wait times.I got the "Fat Bastard" sandwich - Ham, Bacon, EXTRA Dirty Sauce, American. It was a well crafted sandwich.. the quality was there, but the taste wasn't. While it was good, it wasn't a revelation or anything epic.My friend got a "Curtis!" sandwich - Halal Chicken Breast, Marinara, Provolone. I had a taste. Definitely soft, moist and good, but again, nothing epic.Overall, a nice presentation of build quality doesn't make up for lack of taste. But what really killed the experience was when I found a hair in my sandwich - a long one at that, thus 3 stars with some generosity .
Its good. I like it. The portion sizes are smaller than Little Lucca, also the prices are higher, But they actually have a kitchen here with people cooking instead of using the trusty microwave so that's a plus. Its a complete hipster spot. All the patrons appear to be under 35 years of age and all the names of the sandwiches are pop culture references, or local puns. There is no seating inside accept for a few waiting chairs and the line is extremely long. There is an employee who is out managing the line. He was nice enough to tell us a brief history of the restaurant and to recommend his favorite sandwiches. be prepared to have your ears worked with a bunch of "like OMG" and "wassup brah?" for a good 15-30 minutes before you order. A great plus I found is that they bottle their own soft drinks. And they aren't bad. Great to wash down the sandwich with. They have a larger menu that is not displayed on their Chalkboard on their website, so be sure to be looking it up on your cellphone while you are in line. I ordered The Change which is Ribeye with BBQ sauce and onion rings along with their secret sauce, tomato and pickles without lettuce on Dutch Crunch. It was solid. no complaints. even with some of the gripes, I thoroughly enjoyed this place. Make sure you bring a friend. The wait is brutal.
Really good sandwiches! I went here to get lunch, and there was a line, a good sign that this place is popular. I got the "Damn Straight" which was chicken breast, mozzarella sticks, and marinara sauce. Really good and really filling. I liked it a lot. And I think the owner actually comes out and gives the sandwiches to people, which is pretty cool. The sandwich is kind of expensive, so it's not a place I would really go to all the time, but definitely a very good site to hit up!
I would give it 5 stars, but I really can't say Ike's knocked me off my feet. I've been meaning to try this place for awhile, mostly because I never stop hearing people talk about it. I've had a lot of deli sandwiches in my day, so I was expecting something that was going to be otherwordly, but I have to say I was slightly disappointed. I looked at the menu online before coming, because I'm indecisive -- and it took me about 40 minutes to get through the list and decide what I want. SO MANY OPTIONS.I wasn't impressed with the sandwich I ordered -- but then again I didn't get one of the popular ones (I got an Eli Manning). Instead, I ended up swapping my friend for her "going home for thanksgiving + sriracha," which I thought was pretty delicious. I liked the extra spice the sriracha added. Overall I really liked Ike's vibe -- for a hole in the wall everyone was smiling, and people were content waiting. I liked the touch of the caramel apple pop -- brought back memories of elementary school :) Maybe I just needed to try something different?*I recommend taking your sandwich over to Dolores Park, you'll have a lot more room and its a nice place to relaaaaax.
i know there's a ton of reviews for this place already but I have to add to all of them because I had the best sandwich I've ever had at this place! My sister lives in the neighborhood and had never been so when I came to visit, we decided to come here for lunch! The sandwiches, as my sister would describe them, are "intense." I would describe them as ridiculous...because they're ridiculously good. They are huge in portion and will definitely give you food coma afterwards, but it was a good deal because we saved the second half of our sandwiches for dinner! They bake this yummy secret sauce into their bread and use that sauce in most of their sandwiches as well. We got our sandwiches with the dutch crunch bread, which I highly recommend...yuuummm! Oh, and I love the awesome names they have for their sandwiches! =)
hella good
I really admire their dedication to the sandwich making art. I love a place that does one thing but does it exceptionally well. i recommend this place to anyone who visits this part of town and always get a big thank you. I had the Nacho boy and my BF got the MILFBF "this sandwich tastes like regret" but oh so worth it.....he ate the whole thing.....you can certainly keep the other half and eat it the next day but it will be hard to stop.....AMAZING!
Last Sunday, I was beyond irritated... friends I was suppose to meet in the castro were late, there was no parking to be found anywhere in the neighborhood, and I was starving. As I drove down 17th Street, I saw this huge line of people.... I thought, "What could that be??." I then remembered the episode of man versus food on the travel channel which featured this humble sandwich shop. I thought... I'm starving and it is divine intervention that I must eat a sandwich here. I turned onto Sanchez and miraculously found parking... it was meant to be!I stood in the long line trying to shake off irritation...only, I get stuck behind the most whinny asian yuppy chick who had her camera out. She was the most annoying human being I have ever encountered. She barged into the kitchen to take photos of the staff (without permission), in her whinny voiced lamented that she was moving to nyc for a job (how new yorkers are going to receive this woman, i have no idea!). She then proceeded to harrass Ike, the owner (who is SO CUTE, by the way... but I tried not to let on to Ike). She managed to ask 40 questions about the menu! Annoying and Irritated, I was about to strangle someone. Luckily, I was calmed down, by the patient and friendly staff.Finally, I put in an order for a Barry B... turkey, bacon, cheese with dirty sauce on dutch crunch bread. The staff are super friendly, gracious, and efficient as they can be. The crowds can get overwhelming, but they had a knack for keeping the atmosphere positive. Ike plays the role of gracious host with flair... asking people where they're from... patrons were a diverse group: a Latino family from Oakland who made the trek, Asian Yuppies, Hipsters, Castro clones, straights, gays, young, old... all congregate for these amazing sandwiches!Finally, when Ike brought out my sandwich with the caramel apple lollipop, I was ready to devour the paper covering the sandwich. I peeled the neatly wrapped Barry B. I took one bite, and I was overcome with bliss. The crunchy, goey, distinct flavors of the sandwich components make Ike's one of the best sandwiches around!  This food turned me from irritated to bliss! Can food do that? At Ike's, they magically succeed!
i really like their service and the sandwiches are so dame good i'm working on trying them all
I took off one star for having very limited seating (benches in the store) and for the parking situation. Parking is hard to find but it's probably not as bad as trying to find parking in Chinatown. It's not Ike's fault though... but it is what it is. Location is still a factor. I had a somewhat high expectation coming to Ikes because of all the hype. I bought a sandwich calledSuperman: Roast Beef, Pastrami, Turkey, Bacon, Salami, Ham, Avocado and Jack CheeseI thought it was delicious. It took me two sittings to finish the whole thing. I had a "it's good but not THAT great" feeling while eating. Probably due to hype. You have to try it for yourself in order to judge. The chips that come with purchase is way too salty for me. I got the Jalapeno something flavored chips. The first few bites were ok then it got salty. The two apple caramel lollipops that is also included with purchase is a nice addition. Candy is candy :]Wait time is manageable. 10-15 minutes? Oh and last but not least, the staff is really nice. Good service = happy customer. *If you want to order Superman with Ike's smartphone app, I have no idea how to order secret menu items. (for San Francisco location)
Definitely best sandwhiches ever!i came here on their 2nd yr anniversary so basically almost everything on the list were $5 each! 3 sandwhiches cost us about $16 bucks =)1.the menu is overwhelming. choose whatever you like2. call in ahead, so you dont have to wait in line. it takes literally 45 mins.bf n i ordered the #1 #9 and #20. All 3 were really good. its really hard to choose because everything sound so yummy. i personally like #9 because #1 is a lil too salty for me and #20 tasted like hawaiian pizza. you can request for pesto sauce (red or green), jalepeno, which i did and that just added a few more pounds to my belly.  The person who picked up the phone is also very friendly and funny.. "do you want EXTRA EXTRA dirty sauce?" lolso did we finish all 3 sandwhiches? of course not... food coma took over us, for that said the sandwiches are really fullfilling..
The menu is huge! The place is tiny. Prepare yourself to wait unless you call it in, which I did, but was still surprised that I'd have to wait an hour before it was ready. However, it was ready exactly when they said it would be and the service was really quite friendly.Loved the sandwiches but thought the prices were a little steep, $20 for a BLT and a meatball sandwich to go. It's not going to be my go-to work lunch but it was a tasty treat.
Hands down the best sandwich I've ever had! I knew we were in for a wait after reading the other reviews on Yelp but I didn't understand how long it would be until we showed up and found the rest of San Francisco there with us. After an hour of waiting though, it was finally our turn. I love that every single employee at Ike's is friendly and upbeat. When Ike delivered our sandwiches, he looked us in the eyes and gave us a big smile. And when I returned a few minutes later because my order was wrong, he apologized profusely. He let me keep the old sandwich and made me a piping-hot new one. I am such a picky eater that I'm often hard to please but Ike's was more than I ever expected. My sandwich (Do You Smell What Barack Is Cooking) was a bite of heaven and I can't wait to go back!
That dirty sauce that they put on every sandwich is pretty amazing. The Menage a Trois was ridiculously good (although dirty to eat - literally, as in sauce dripping out of the sandwich since we had ours cut into fours) - the three types of cheese were delicious. The SF Giants was more "regular" and cleaner to eat but also good. The girl taking our order was awesome - we told her we had no clue what to order, and she just acted on our behalf and ordered the two sandwiches above. She didn't even tell us what she had ordered us until after we had paid. It was great. My only wish for this place is for indoor seating.
I didn't want to do this, but I'm left without a choice. Ike gets a 4.5 for their sandwiches and variety. The few times I've actually resigned to waiting over an hour for a sandwich, I have actually enjoyed the sandwich - the bread was generally fresh, the dirty sauce garlicky, and the turkey / avocado hit the spot. Meat is OK quality, but I'm a bit of a NY snob when it comes to deli meats.  The last two times I've called, they've given me an estimate of a 3 hour wait!!! For a sandwich!!! Are you #^@#)*$@ kidding me? I mean, come on...that's no way to run a business. I have a lot of respect for these guys for coming up with the menu, but the shop is run poorly. I like their decision to expand to Stanford...they should do well there. But there is no excuse for more than a half hour wait for a sandwich, I'm sorry. 3 hours deserves 3 stars.Alternatively, if you wait in line and don't call in, you might get away with a shorter wait (approx 45 mins - 1 hr weekend afternoon). Oh, sandwiches aren't cheap either...
My friend suggested we go here and I cringed when I saw the line go out the door. I looked through the menu and I finally decided to order the Matt Cain with the dutch bread. We got chips as a part of the meal and I munched on the jalapeno flavored chips (which was super salty). Finally about 15 minutes, we got our food and we headed over to the park near by to sit and eat. I dug into my first bite and it was AWESOME!! I loved it! My sandwich (Matt Cain) had roast beef, turkey, provolone and their Godfather sauce for $10.00. What a great combo b/c it was so freakin' good! I'm pretty particular about food but by far, this is the best sandwich I have ever tasted. I'm bummed that they don't have this place in Socal (where I'm from) but if I ever go there again, I'm gonna make sure I drop by Ikes again. ^__^
Belmont music studio is a great place for all age's and level's of experience. I'm 57 learning to play electric guitar, Ive increased my level of play and comfortable with the pace of my teacher. But most of all have a great time learning!
Wow. Just. Wow. Flave-tastic. What a sandwich, what a sandwich, what a mighty good sandwich. Somehow today's adventures probably made the sandwiches taste all that much more glorious. My friends and I had come to SF for a food adventure, but a lot of driving and getting stuck in traffic and getting lost was involved. And by getting lost I mean not getting off the 80 soon enough and accidentally ending up on the bay bridge to Oakland (which was my fault but I blame my friend's crappy directions on his smartphone). Then driving through Chinatown repeatedly trying to look for parking quite unsuccessfully (we were trying to get to Golden Gate Bakery). Finally we stopped at Ike's last, because admittedly we had all been looking forward to getting sandwiches here. Personally, I had been wanting to try the infamous Ike's sandwiches for over 2 years now. And today, finally! At long last! Last night, I knew I was coming here so I was excitedly looking at their ginormous menu on their website (which sadly the store itself had a much smaller menu with some items missing) but luckily enough, they had the two sandwiches I wanted to try. The spiffy tiffy and matt cain, which my friend and I ordered one of each and split the halves. (the smart thing to do ^^ imo) At first, I was skeptical of the Matt Cain just because I felt like all that meat would just be too much...you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. BUT, oh contrare my friend! Everything was so yummy it was like a flavor party in my mouth. and that Godfather sauce? Good lord I could probably eat that on anything! If only I could figure out the secret to that sauce! The Spiffy Tiffy was amazing as well. I love the fact that the halal chicken is shredded and not a chunk of chicken breast because quite honestly that can turn out to be a little dry. Shredding the chicken allows more of the meat to soak up the flavors and moistness and stay absolutely scrumptious. And I am a sucker for pesto so this definitely hit the spot. I'm a happy girl :]
Dear Ike,Thank you again for the simple yet exceptional roast beef, with avocado, pickles, and all the love you put between those Dutch crunch rolls. You are consistently blowing my mind, because i have no idea how you get the innards of my sandwich to taste so saucy.Thanks again,Adam
Ok, ok. I said some things in anger, Ike's Place. Since my last review, some things have changed. Ike's found their own spot and moved out of Lime. I've picked up several orders for my office since then and the staff is always very patient and cool, even when we have special requests and pay separately for 9 sandwiches with different forms of payment during the lunch hour rush. I've also found sandwiches that match my pallet better. The best strategy if you are ordering with some others is to order a few sandwiches and split them so you get a good variety.
delicious sandwiches
Ike, I used to love you. You were my go-to sandwich place in 2008-2009. But your sandwiches have been really skimpy lately, and you've raised your prices. Shame on you.
Love their sandwiches!!! Besides the long wait that seems to be the norm here, so worth the wait! The only downside is the fact that there's no where to sit and devour those delish sandwiches! But definitely reccomend this place to everyone!
Waking up with some FRS Energy, I was getting a case of the munchies. I felt like an untraditional brunch - Ike's Place. I had heard of Ike's from a magazine, not sure which one. I was the first customer and the cheery staff of three behind the counter were hospitable and fun. They recommended their favorites and being the mind readers that they are, I got the Tony Soprano with a cream soda. Chilling outside, it was fun watching the neighborhood on 16th and Sanchez wake up.
SO FREAKING GOOD... went to norcal for a visit from socal and we waited around 2 hours just for a sandwich... they have awesome names and the sandwich is even better... what is in that dirty sauce? it's sooo good. big portioned too :]
Over the years I have put a lot things in my mouth. Lets not start a list...But I can easily say that very few of them have been as delicious as what I put in my mouth last night.I generally don't like to kiss and tell, but in this case, I am telling: it was the Hasta La Vista sandwich! This beast was insanely delicious, and HUGE. So enjoyable, I couldn't get enough... Probably more so since it was my first time.I will be back for more...again, and again, and again!
I don't understand all the fanfare that this place gets. I've eaten here twice the wait alone is enough to deter me from ever going again. On my first visit there was about a 15 min wait, my second (and most definitely my last visit) there was a 35 min wait for a sandwich. Add to this the sound of the owner berating his staff- NOT WORTH IT. To top off the experience, my sandwich was missing onions and had cheese burned to the top of the sweet roll. Yuck.There are much better sandwich shops in this town, one's I'll be going to over Ike's ANY day of the week.
Dear Ike,As I walked through the door of your tiny shop I immediately felt like I was standing at the Chuck E Cheese prize counter. There are so many options and they all look really cool! Since I'm a libra, I'm extremely indecisive, so my decision is usually based on a little eenie-meenie-miny-mo action followed by a hint of fear that I chose the wrong one, but that was not the case at your place.I think you might be the King Midas of the lunchtime food world - I'm convinced that every sandwich you touch is golden!!! My Nacho Boy (roast beef, avocado, mushrooms and swiss) sandwich was a hot mess of goodness and that dirty sauce is so good. I swear there must be MSG or some other addictive substance in it because just like Depeche Mode, I just can't get enough!Anyways, thanks for the sandwich, Ike. You seem like a really cool guy and I will return soon to randomly select another sandwich.-krysP.S. You gave me a pink tootsie pop, that I certainly appreciated, but next time, if it's not too much trouble...may I please have a caramel apple pop? Charms sweet 'n sour pops are cool too. :)
One of the best sandwich places ever. Pretty much all the sandwich here are good. Just prepared to wait in long lines when you get here but it well worth it.
Ike's Place is awesome- by far the best vegan sandwich I have had in my life! I have been meaning to try this place out for about a year and I finally made it today with two of my friends who live in the Castro and are regulars here. Finally!Ike's place is a tiny hole-in-the-wall type of place that consists of a small room with a counter and a fridge with a nice variety of drinks. The menu is overwhelming with all of the different sandwich and salad options, and it is packed. This place is busy, but for a good reason! I had no idea what to order so I asked them what a good vegan sandwich with avocado was, and they recommended the vegan we're just friends, which consisted of wheat bread, soy turkey, orange glaze, avocado, soy cheese and veggies. It was a little on the pricey side but the sandwich was humongous and extremely tasty. They also gave us watermelon and cherry blowpops with our sandwiches which I thought was really cute.Next time I go there I want to try the Papa Sam, which is a wild salmon burger with dirty sauce and cheese (of course, I'd get soy cheese since I don't eat dairy). My friends both said it was to die for.I love this place! It totally deserves five stars for it's great sandwiches, vast menus, friendly staff and Ike's level of originality and creativity with something as simple as a sandwich.
Although I thought it would be bigger, it was a fun experience. Despite the long line it is worth the wait. I had the 'Cowboy' by recommendation of the friendly and helpful cashier. A lively atmosphere, but there's no place to sit and eat. I will be returning!!
I wish I could give them 10 Stars!Best sandwich I have ever had and wish I could have saved some for when I got home!Bread is perfect, as fresh as you can get and be sure to get the dirty sauce on yours!DO NOT MISS IKE'S PLACE! Be sure to call it in though the wait time can be extensive!Recommend the Lincecum and the Eli Manning!
-Seating is next to nothing. 4 tables outside with about 4 chairs to each table. There are some shady people who like to put their feet up on a chair "reserving it" for someone... that someone never came.. but that chair did make a good leg rest for that jerk..-The line can fluctuate. When my friends and I got there the line was short.. Mid way through ordering the line stretched out to the street... While eating, the line was very short.. then when we left the line wrapped around to the next door store.-Inside is EXTREMELY small and while ordering you feel cramped, rushed and flustered. -there are is a MASSIVE amount of sandwiches to order. If you have the time, check our the binder of extra sandwiches that should be floating around from person to person. The list of sandwiches on the wall above the cashier is seriously only a fraction of what they really have.. (Check out the binder!!!)-There were 6 of us. My sandwich was missing something and 2 of my friends got their order messed up also. They didn't make a new one.. they just said "oh.. sorry" and walked away. *sigh*-I made up my own sandwich: turkey, avocado, roast beef, pepperjack cheese (that they forgot to put in) and everything in the sandwich. It was good but a little oily/greasy and very heavy. I could only eat half.. not because I was full but because the sandwich was just way too oily for my tasting. -I got back to the hotel and ate the other half of the sandwich. For some reason it tastes a lot better after it "dries" off a bit. 3 stars.. I'll definitely come back though to try something else. I just wish they wouldn't mess up religiously on sandwiches...
Ok, I forgive you Ike.I brought my dad here who is from out of town so I always try to bring him to good food places here and he loved it too. I got the 23 and he got the 5 and ok, just yum and everyone was really nice and I can't wait to go back and get fat again. Did I mention the sandwich lasted me all day too? I could not eat it one in a sitting, and that's a good thing.
Cut to the chase: Best Sandwiches EVER.Seriously.My friend heard about this place on Best of the Bay. We tried it when not sure what to grab for lunch. So glad that we did.I had the "Joker" sandwich - a meatball sandwhich with red pesto, fried zuchinni, and roasted veggies on dutch crunch. OMG - it was so good that even as large as it was, I was determined to eat the whole thing.My friend had the turkey with cranberry sauce. Also super delicious!Will be back again and again. Thank you Ike for helping me to pack on the pounds ;-)
Everyone has had that day when 1 or 2 rolls around and you absolutely dreaming of the best, wildest, most mouthwatering concoction of a sandwich possible. Look no further friends, Ikes has it all. First timers give Manage A Trios or the Going Home for Thanks Giving
When you first look at it, it's just a hole in the wall that's super crowded. However, the food is way better than it appears. They have a website that lists a huge number of sandwiches, but their menu board only displays so many. I tried the 'Super Mario' which had meatballs, fried mozzarella sticks, marinara and some veggies; it was delicious. A friend told me that they have an app available on iOS (iPhone) that you can place your order in advance and pick it up at a specific time, which seems very attractive based on the fact that you will be waiting for some time if you just try to walk in.
Really loved the creativeness of the menu and wow, they have a lot of choices! It was hard to decide. I finally chose the Chicken with Avocado? I forgot the clever name they attached to it. But it was tastyyy! I heard a lot of rave reviews about this place and I do like it but I would not make a special trip just to go here.
The very best sandwiches for non-Estella type vegetarian/vegan sandwiches. I love the Tom Brady!!
I had the Spiffy Tiffy & it was the best sandwich that I've ever had! Unbelievable. Can't wait to come back & try something else
Best sandwich place in SF! Whatever you get, get it on a Dutch crunch! My favorite is Change (thinly sliced rib-eye, BBQ sauce, beer battered onion rings, cheddar cheese)
The sandwiches were beyond superb. I went there while on vacation & would go back to San Francisco just for their sandwiches. The "dirty sauce" is unbelievable. They have numerous choices, all which look (and smell) fantastic. I decided to add the mozzarella sticks and poppers to my sandwich which only intensified the deliciousness. I wish there was something like this at home.
This place is amazing. They pack their sandwiches full of meat, or meat substances if you're a vegetarian. They have all kinds of sandwiches, but my favorite is the king koopa, and what's cool about Ike's is that most of the sandwiches can come vegetarian. It's not really somewhere you can go to sit down and eat, especially if the weather is bad (there's only outdoor seating), but for food to go, Ike's is the place to go.
I ordered the 1/2 spiffy tiffy and my bf at the time got the superman... I loved my sandwich... Chicken, pesto, Gouda and everything else... So good, I could only eat half and saved the other half for my next days lunch... Crazy line but u could always do a phone order... Friendly staff!!
It just so happened I saw the episode of Man VS. Food where he went to one of the locations at Ike's Place a few days before I was heading up to the Bay. My B planned on taking me there since he went a few weeks prior and he said it was AMAZING.We went to the location off 16th St. The line was reallly crackin' when we got there. Honestly the only downside (about that spot at least) was waiting because we were super hungry. We probably stood in line for maybe 25-30 min just to order and we were near some annoying lady. I've never tried it before so it was cool that people were passing back menu's as we got closer to the line.I ordered the Manage-a-Trois with mozzerella sticks inside. B ordered the Change and my other homegirl got the Eli Manning. It ranged from about 12-14 bucks for each sandwich. Now, as I was reading the menu I thought okay honey mustard...will it taste good with all that other stuff? Needless to say, I will vouch for Ike's including all the sandwiches we ordered especially mine since I had my doubts about it. The honey mustard in it was ridiculously good. It definitely MADE that sandwich. We all passed to the right and tried eachothers sandwiches and I was very impressed. One of the workers told us that they will be opening one at Stanford soon and the other location is in Redwood City I believe. Also, you can call in your order and pick it up but the worker told us you would have to call in the morning if you wanted your sandwich by lunch time and so on. It was a new experience for me and also an experience I would do all over again. A place wouldn't have a long line if it wasn't that GOOD. Definitely worth the wait, and I would go eat there again in a heartbeat!
I have to say "Ike" of Ike's sandwich's excels in the customer service department. Ike read this review and extended many invitations for me to come back and try another sandwich on the house. A good attiitude goes a long way! So i took Ike up on his offer and went back and had another sandwich. I asked for the Spiffy Tiffy, with pickles on the side.The french roll was so yummy and crunchy! I really enjoyed this sandwich and Ike's hospitality. I'll definitely come back again, not sure bout waiting in line though. And they forgot the pickles...Oh well.Well after watching the Best of the Bay(about Ike's), I thought I'd give this place a shot. It's conveniently located right around the corner from my house, so I decided to call my order in. The person on the phone said it would take exactly 15 minutes, I showed up at the right time and indeed my sandwich was ready! So far so good. I got right home to try the sandwich (same one Best of the Bay tried)the Menage a Trois, Halal Chicken Breast, Real Honey, Honey Mustard, BBQ sauce and Pepper Jack Cheese, I removed it from the bag and the wrapped sandwich was completely soaked and dripping wet.The bread was soggy but I wanted to try it anyway. I managed to half-heartdly finish 1/2 the sandwich and the other half went in the garbage! I just wasted $9.77 while our economy is in crisis on a crummy over sauced, over hyped sandwich. Hopefully you'll choose your sandwich carefully, as for myself, I'll go elsewhere.
DELICIOUS. ive been to ike's in Stanford before this location opened, but I finally found a reason to come to the Castro location. I usually get the matt cain, but decided to try something different and went for the menage a trois on a dutch crunch. the sandwich was really tasty, though a little saucy for my liking. you also get a HUGE sandwich with a side of chips so it was totally worth it.
oh ike's!! if i could eat here every day i would.. every single sandwich is delicious.. my fave seems to be the spiffy tiffy though with fried zucchini on it.. im salivating just thinking about it lol lex luther is hella yummy, eli manning, kryptonite (its like 2 whole sandwiches in one, prepare for a food coma!) my go tos when i cant decide lol.. and dirty sauce is a must, dont ask questions, just get it!
I am not going to lie to you, I had the PZ Burger a few days ago and found it to be totally bland. Not to mention, pricey, (2 sandwiches = $19) and we were both disappointed. Price per pound of sandwich, it may have been a good deal, but I have come to require a bit more from my food than just quantity.There were too many people in the crowded kitchen, at first I didn't understand why I had a two-hour wait for my sandwich when there were so many people working in the kitchen. I had a 45 minute wait to contemplate this while waiting on line to pay for the sandwiches. Still no answer.Okay, so I read a lot of reviews here that indicated that it was the best-ever sandwich shop in SF. Honesty, have had so much better, and for half the price, and yes, here in SF.
Ikes- Yum- Yum I waited in line for 45 minutes, at least it was a sunny day! The cashier, whom I presume could have been Ike himself, was busy assisting everyone with their orders and I must admit I was impressed with how happy and genuinely nice he was to each guest. He treated every order with importance and urgency - although I did hear some people voice complaints about the wait. Seriously, if you walk up to a place that has a line and you stand in that line, you should not be complaining about the wait- you saw it coming. Once you get your sandwich of choice in hand, all that waiting doesn't feel so bad. I had the best sandwich I've ever had in my life at Ikes and I can't wait to return. Thank you Ikes!
We got married at SF City Hall and afterwards our next destination... Ike's Place! We brought all of our guests here because we absolutely love this place. Hands down to the dutch crunch rolls, The Al Bundy sandwich and to the staff who took care of all of our sandwiches and guests. All of our guests agrees "The best sandwiches they have ever had!"
Been here twice. Both times had great sandwiches. I had a more ordinary sandwich the first time, I think it was the Matt Cain...i forget, and that was really good.The second time I got the menage a trois with halal chicken breast, real honey, honey mustard and bbq sauce with an assortment of cheeses. That was probably one of the best sandwiches I've had in my life. It was an interesting combo with the bbq sauce, honey and honey mustard, but let me assure you it was delicious!The only negative is that there's really nowhere to sit around there, and it's probably a better idea to take it to go. They have a small seating area outside which fits around 5-6 people. The lines are long, but you can phone in your order, to save time.
I came here on a wednesday night with my dad. There was only one person in line ahead of us. We ordered our sandwiches and I asked for a military discount. They were so friendly towards me and gave a really nice discount for me. Their sandwiches were amazing!!! I miss Ike's place. I cant wait to come back home to come back here again :)
I suppose you could take stars off for the price, but you wouldn't even consider doing so once you actually take a bite (though I will say I got a mocha here once and it was awful).Seriously, they have a zillion kinds of sandwiches, to way frou frou sprouty things to real sandwiches, with fucking meat and fucking cheese. And they're just all awesome. It's been on the front page of Yelp for weeks now and it lives up to every bit of the hype. If you like sandwiches, and you haven't been, get off your ass.
Came here today during lunch hour traffic and waited in line for 30 minutes. Well worth the wait-- everyone was super friendly and got my order out in about 10 minutes. I got the Hot Pastrami sandwich. Dutch Crunch is the best!! They have so many options... I suggest researching the menu before coming in. Downside #1: I asked for jalapeno poppers, but did not get them. But I'll forgive them since they were so busy, yet FRIENDLY!Downside #2: They close at 7PM, so no late night munchies for you!
The sandwiches here are crazy good! I only decided to come here because i bought a gift certificate online which gave me 50% off my meal. They have a large selection of sandwiches which will lead you to the end of the line because you're letting people ahead of you. They have a unique sauce called their "dirty sauce". It's orgasmic.Try the Phil 'Em Up KC sandwich! It has roast beef, bbq sauce and cheddar cheese. Yummm. Along with your sandwich, you get a bag of DIrty chips which are also good! Plus, they give you lollipops with the sandwich.They are always changing it up so remember what you get or else you won't see it on the menu anymore like my sandwich. This is a must-go-to place. The only down-side to this place is it is well hidden and there are not enough tables.
So my boyfriend and I went to Sf for our anniversary.I, of course, heard about Ike's from Man Vs. Food; so I made a point of it to stop here.We waited in line for almost an hour! I read the reviews online and was prepared to wait . ..  but it was a little ridiculous!I got the Paul Reubens and it was hella delicious!!!! Ike said it's his favorite, but not sure if he says that about all his sandwiches!! The hubby got "Say Hey" and it was pretty grubbin, but not as good as mine.
I LOVE [Name of Girl I'm Dating] !!! She is beautiful in all that she has to offer - chicken, honey mustard, pepper jack, avocado, onions, lettuce, banana peppers, tomatoes, and DIRTY DIRTY sauce - mmmmm yeah!! She's huuuuuuge and messy and well worth the price ($8)!! Ike's is absolutely wonderful! It's a small, small spot, probably fits about 5 people in there at most - and sometimes can be a wait, but the sandwiches are damn worth it. They have a good selection of vegetarian and vegan sandwiches too if thats what you're into!I heart you, Ike!!
Best sandwiches ever! Would eat their burgers everyday if they still had them. Bring 'em back! :-)
Phenomenal! Dirty sauce rocks. Great, friendly staff with great recommendations.
Easy 5 star review...Ike's just plain good.
Is this place probably overrated? Yes. Is it absolutely delicious? Yes. OK, so that's five stars in my book. There can be a wait, but it's worth it.
Best sandwiches on the planet! Everytime im in San Francisco, Ikes is a must.. Although at times there can be a long wait for sandwiches, its well worth it.My favorite is "change" ribeye steak with bbq sauce, onion rings, gouda. It is ridiculously tasty.
Hands down, A great sandwich..... Best? ... no but Id say top 10. Worth the wait? HELL NO. I guess if Im in the city after not being there in a while and Im DYING for a sandwich... Id wait 15-20 minutes for ikes. With that being said I probably wont be getting ikes for a long time. 3 times Ive went to IKES. 2 times I waited in line. 1st time was to support local shit and try the raved sandwich. took around 50 min from line till dine.2nd time, I was with a buddy that wanted to try this sandwich I told him about......... 1 f'n hour and 5 minutes. I would have left but we had already dedicated 40 min and needed to kill time for something else anyway.3rd time, I did an illegal Uturn and went back to the mission dist.I will say if you havent ever been, go. It is worth saying youve had it cuz it is a great sandwich. And when you go, might as well make it worth your wait and get 2 sandwiches. Ive only had 2, 2 diferent ways.The nacho boy and the menage a trois. the 1st time was with veggies and stuff,... still good.BUT for those hot sandwiches "AS-IS" is the way to go!!!now go enjoy
The original!! The best!! DON'T go to the one in Cupertino if you've had the original, just doesn't compare
There's not much to say other than this is the best sandwich I've had in San Francisco. Dare I say perfect?Halal chicken, bacon, bbq sauce, "special" sauce and lettuce on sourdough. I am now having one very happy Wednesday.
Finally got to try Ike's and I'm sooo glad I didn't have to wait too long. I ordered the Menage A Trois and the chicken was so tender and juicy with the honey sauce. The sauce wasn't too overpowering or sweet either - just perfect. It was a very big sandwich but I ate the whole thing! I must say that it's one of the best sandwiches that I've had in SF so far. Hopefully I get to come back soon to try their other popular sandwiches.
Amazing sandwich.Long wait + kinda pricey for a sandwich + take out only, so I have to drop it to 4 stars.Regardless, I'll definitely be back!
Wowwwaaaweewa!!Fan-farking-tastic! Get that Joker, and do yourself a favor and just let these guys do what they do! Dont change anything and just enjoyDelish!!! Bravo!
Best Sandwich shop in the city! Ike is amazing!You can never get bored form this place with so many selections!
The first time I came here was almost 2+ years ago and I honestly don't remember what I got. All I know was the sandwich blew my mind because it was THAT good. Over the past month, I came here twice with some friends and I got the Kryptonite and the Lex Luther. These are each $20 sandwiches but they each account for 2 sandwiches so in a way you're still paying $10 per "sandwich." The only catch is that by ordering the $20 sandwich, they skimp you out on chips, but they do compensate you by giving you a fatty sandwich. Even as a $10 sandwich (or half of a kryptonite or Lex luther), it's larger than any of the other non-$20 sandwiches that's on the menu. If there's ever a day that you could care less about calories, try Ike's Place. And they did recently just open one up in the South Bay.
Excellent sandwiches, but I hope you like potato chips. Love the caramel apple suckers though.
Give a foodie a scooter & a lunch break and oh the places she will go!I zipped all the way across town for a delectable Ike's sandwich since I could not stop drooling over all the Yelp Ike's sandwich pictures, and ohmyf-ing god! It was THE best sandwich I have ever had- no joke. The crispy dutch crunch bread, fresh lettuce & pickles, and all-around great combo of ingredients had me scarfing down my sandwich w/ pure bliss. I ordered their "Name of the Girl I'm Dating" sandwich since I heard it was their most popular, and sweet baby jesus- I HIGHLY recommend it!Their extensive menu caters to all types of customers- from Vegan to the pickiest of eaters- they've got it all. I really can't complain about the lollipop they slipped into my takeout bag. It's like icing on the cake!No wonder why Ike's is on Yelp's hot list!
This place is tiny, there's very limited seating outside and the wait is a little long but it's all worth it after you take that first bite of your delicious sandwich!! The staff was very friendly and patient with each customer that I saw them come into contact with. The each seemed to enjoy their job and it made me smile when they would break out and sing along to the songs on the radio. I had the Back Stabber which was turkey and artichoke hearts, caesar dressing and I think italian dressing. Very tasty. My husband had the Nacho Boy Sandwich which included Roast Beef, Mushrooms, Avocado, Swiss Cheese. Also very well made and great tasting. You can't go wrong with Ike's! Try it! I can't wait to go back!
I was skeptical of going here at first. We were visiting San Francisco and only had 2 1/2 days to enjoy the city and I was not about to go all over town for food. Except that's exactly what we did. On our last day John said we had to go to Ikes because of the apparent foodgasm one gets from eating here. I wanted to go on a bike ride over the bridge, but due to time constraints Ikes won out. Long story short, I will be going to Ikes Place every time I go to San Francisco. It is by far the best sandwich I've had. I had "the Change" on Dutch Crunch bread. I'm still salivating over it, and it's been a month or so. I'm now scouring LA for a sandwich place that can compare. Wish me luck! Next time i'm in San Fran I'll be grabbing my Ike's sandwich and taking it on a bike ride over the golden gate bridge.
Five stars. Bread = delicious, options= plentiful, ingredients = fresh, staff = friendly. Best sandwich in SF.Only downside (and I refuse to dock them a star) is that it gets busy. Call your order in first.Health inspection scorecard = 100, BTW.
Love ordering and then hanging out in a nightclub while you wait for your lunch. I went for the turkey and avocado on dutch crunch to get the feel for the basic sandwich. It was not a long wait but we got there early and boy did it hit the spot! Hubby go the meatless meatball sandwich. He was not disappointed either. The chips were also good, especially the Funky Fusion. After those my sea salty ones tasted downright bland.
I love Ike's! they have the best sandwiches ever. I usually get the "nacho boy".. It has roast beef, avocado, mushrooms, and a whole lot of deliciousness! lol. Even tho there's ALWAYS a long line, they are still fast on orders. This place is GREAT!!! =) **** TWO THUMBS UP****
This is a great sandwich shop. The menage a trois with dirty sauce is top 5 sandwiches I have ever eaten. It had bbq sauce and real honey and topped that off with their dirty sauce = tasttyyy, but watch out for the mess hahah (but its worth it). you get a free bag of chips which is great. They also have a neat assortment of drinks, the lemonade and root beer were great. This place would receive a 5 star from me if they didnt have ridiculous lines most of the time. They also do not have space for you to dine in
Bold! Sexy! Mouth-watering!Nope, not talking about Matt Damon - it's the Paul Reuben from Ike's! Apparently Ike's favorite (he has good taste!) and a lover of Reuben's myself, I had to have it. How is a sandwich this good?! Let me count the ways: 1. Beautiful color! pink meat, purple cabbage, green banana peppers2. Messy! Dirty Sauce - have to have it!3. Crunch! Veggies, dutch crunch-liciousness4. Cheap! Stuffed for $8.50More than satisfying. No wait - got there right at 12 PM. Ike is super friendly and sweet! High 5 Ike!It would be a dream to try all sandwiches...I'll be back.Know Before You Go:1. Go now! And say hello to Ike!
Oh man I wish I never tried this place because now I can't stop craving it day and night. After hearing from many friends that this place was the best I finally got my chance to over there. My bf and I first walked in and were overwhelmed with the delicious choices. The sweet man behind the counter gave us his fav options and we decided to take his word. I ordered the now voted #1 ESPN best sando the Matt Cain and the bf ordered the Menage a Trois. You get your choice of any bag of Dirty chips for free and a caramel apple pop included. When I first took a bite I was blown away. The flavors flowed so well it was insane. It was a turkey, roast beef, salami, Godfather sauce (ahhhh) on a suggested sourdough roll. Heavennnn. Tried the bf's and his was amazing as well with different flavors (their bbq sauce on the Trois is great). Has my definite vote of best sando in SF, possibly the state. It's THAT good!!!What are you waiting for???? GOOO
I've traveled hours, waited in hour long lines, stood in the pouring, and recommended it to everyone I know. Ike's is amazing! I'm not into variety, so I only ever order one sandwich there (The Tony Soprano on Dutch) but I've tried all of my friends' and each and everyone had been delicious.
#100. Menage a Trois on the 2010 Big Eat SF listzOMG.i hate bbq.i don't do dutch crunch.and honey on salty things doesn't really work for me.but ...THIS WAS AN AMAZING SANDWICH.yes i called at 4 and could only pick up at 6:15 on a saturday eve/afternoon. and yes it was crazy messy. but you could smell it even when it was wrapped, all nice and warm. they were true to their word and extremely punctual. and super nice on the phone & in person to boot....and fresh dutch crunch made to order just for my lil' sandwich? wow.(now i just need to go back and start trying their hundreds of creations)
Good Vibrations from the true SF heart! That's what I got with my sammie! Geez, the place is packed with employees that are all smiling and happy and teasing each other in a way that makes you feel like they are enjoying making, um, sandwiches. I had the salmon 'burger' without the dirty sauce on a baguette. By the time I got home and sunk my teeth in, I was hungry enough to eat the paper. The only disappointment was the jalapenos which were more like marinated peppers from the jar. Fresh is just the only answer. But the salmon was cooked to sheer deliciousness. It was about $8 and some change for my gustatory delight, and this was right in line with all the other sandwiches. I noticed that a lot of the vegan items had been retired off the menu, don't know if it is permanently, but the options were def more limited than noted in other reviews.  Really friendly people and fairly fast service with a good range of beverages. Really a MUST try.
Good sandwiches, but kind of heavy. Giving 2 stars instead of 3-4 because I usually get them in a big group order, and they really suck at big orders. They're consistently late, sometimes put the order down for a different day, and there are ALWAYS a few sandwiches that were made wrong.
I won't start off with why I didn't give Ike's 5 stars (*) because I think their good far outweighs their not-so-good. The bread is amaze-balls. Fresh, light, doughy goodness. I love their workers who smiled and seemed genuinely happy to provide me with tasty sammiches on a rainy early day. This place understands what a REAL sandwich joint is. Reminds me of a my formerly favorite lunch spot called The Upper Krust in Dayton, OH (RIP).*If you'd asked me for a star count for Ike's at about 9:54am last Sunday, I would have said "get the crap out of my face and don't mention the word 'Ike' to me again!" because they'd lost the order I placed for my hub's 40th b-day party. But when I called to confirm they had the order, they called me back and apologized for a computer malfunction. And then they proceeded to churn out two platters of grub for a vegetarian-meat-eater mix that had everyone happy pappy. Go Ike's!!
My friends and I HAVE to get a sandwich here every time we go to AT&T Park. No questions asked.
"i'd like the M.I.L.F. extra dirty" -- with names like this, ordering is half the fun.. but that's not what makes me go back almost on a bi-weekly basis.. the sandwiches are AH-MAZING. they are the reason this place has stayed open and maintained a loyal fan-base despite being evicted and moving 3 times within a block radius.having tried a decent portion of the menu, these are the ones i'd recommend:- if you like your sandwiches sweet, get menage a trois* with onions, extra dirty, on dutch crunch. even if you don't like bbq sauce, i recommend trying this.. it just might change your mind- if you're in the mood for something savory, try the MILF*, as is, with extra dirty sauce (this is like hot mama huda but with JALAPENO POPPERS)- spiffy tiffy*, as is, on sour dough-- usually i prefer dutch crunch, but the tartness of the sourdough really compliments the pesto-mushroom-avocado-pepperjack-provolone combo- paul reubens, as is, extra dirty, extra sauce.. i've had this both with corned beef and with pastrami. they are both delicious. - honorable mention: change, extra dirty, dutch crunchnote: getting all the veggies on your sandwich might be tempting, but i recommend choosing "as is" (a.k.a. not adding anything). each sandwich has a unique taste-- all those veggies just get in the way of experiencing it.*all chicken sandwiches are halal, so zabiha-eaters rejoice! the best sandwiches (in my opinion) are chicken anyways.
"Woohoo! As good as it gets" is EXACTLY correct this time. I don't know if there is anything new that can be said about Ike's but it's just a few blocks from my house, and it truely is as good as everyone says. I ordered a sandwhich with the vegan "bacon" which I have never had before and was a little nervous about, but it was DELICIOUS. I had HIGH expectations for this sandwhich, and it still blew my mind. Oh, and the trick to quick service, I have mastered: #1. Go for dinner, not lunch. #2 Order over the phone first, then pick up. good eats ya'll, mad good eats. . .
After my less-than-enthusiastic original review, Ike sent me a message apologizing for the disappointing experience I'd had and that he hoped I'd try again especially with their updated menu. That alone would've been enough for me to come back, but I was also curious to try again as 726 reviews (as of this update) can't be that off.I visited Ike's again yesterday when a friend treated me to lunch there. We hit it at a far more mellow time--weekday just before 2--and I was impressed by the understanding customer service we received. They no longer charge extra for leaving off the dirty sauce (score another point for listening to your customers!) and were very accommodating to any way I wanted my sandwich. And tasty it was. My friend got the Tony Soprano, a choice she knew her Italian significant other would be proud of, and she was quite pleased with the result.An added cool thing was that I discovered Ike had just had his birthday (Mar. 29) so wished him a happy belated birthday--hooray for Aries!PS: Has anyone thought about getting "I Like Ike(s)" buttons made?
I had to try after all the reviews, and I must say I was very pleased! We got there around 2:30pm on a Tuesday. I was thinking the lunch rush had past by then but I was wrong. I think this Place is constantly busy. We were in line for a few which was fine with me b/c it took me forever to decide on what to eat. The menu is huge and filled with amazing creations. Yes, the waiting sucks and there really isn't much to to chill and enjoy your delicious Sandie but oh well. I can't wait to go back
Ike's sandwiches are the best sandwiches I've ever had. So head over to their website and check out the complete menu. The full menu is not displayed in store. Once you have made your selection either call in your order or head there to wait in line. Oh and the sandwich comes with Ike's Dirty Sauce on it. Trust me you want it. So that's about it. I love Ike's Place and I HIGHLY recommend it. Pretty sure we are at the stage now where you can trust me. Good talk as always.
Alright, so I was starving and I'd seen the line in front of this place many times. I waited about 30 minutes, standing in line and for them to make my sandwhich...anticipation had been properly built up.I ordered the "Not Tonight, I Have a Headache". It was good, definitely better than most generic deli sandos that are no better than what you could make at home. However, it definitely wasn't the best sandwhich I've ever had. The ingredients are probably better than what you'd get at Quiznos, but I found the taste to be comprable.They do have the most extensive sandwhich menu I've seen. The options all sounded pretty tasty, so I'll probably give it another day in court to see if I can find a more tasty option, but I'll defintiely call (2 hours) ahead of time to put in my order.
Was excited to try this place but a little apprehensive because I had heard so much hype. Fortunately, it lived up to it! Hands down best sandwich I've ever had -- The Ugly Owl on the Dutch bread. Their vegan chicken was amazing (meat-eating husband was even impressed), loved the dirty sauce, the staff was friendly (and funny), and a quick walk took us to Dolores Park for some very interesting people-watching and a great Ike's picnic.
Great place! Get the 'pizzle' on the 'dutch crunch' bread!!!This place is soo good, we went to it two days in a row while visiting SF!!!Very easy to get too off 16th street.
NOTE: Get there early. The line waits outside, there is NO SITTING AREA except a few tables the establishment provides, which is outdoors as well. Wear attire appropriately. Takeaway: - And as countless others have attested, we don't know exactly what Dirty Sauce is, but it's awesome. - The Mack is the best sandwich I have ever eaten in my life or recent memory. No joke. I dare anyone to try it and say otherwise. - The servings are pretty huge, so if you're going out on a date, be cautious. It's filling, filling.
I moved so I could be closer to Ike's. Don't know what else there is to say.Ike's is spectacular.
I ordered the MILF, and it was hot.Probably the best sandwich shop in SF.
Ike's Yikes.. very good sandwiches. I love the names, variety, taste, and most appreciatet eh Halal Chicken. Very taste from Halal chicken to a mix in deli meats sandwiches with their "special sauce." I am not a fan of long lines and having to order my sandwich way in advance in order to get by 12pm. Parking is sucky but if you want a great sandwiches then you will love Ike's. I am a fan!
You have to wonder how such a tiny little place gets such a crazed following. Still, I had a very delicious sandwich from this tiny little hole in the wall. I'll try to be back - but there are so many other enticing places to try in SF, and SF is so far away...
Best sandwiches I've ever had. Ever. In. My. Life.Disclaimer (!!!): I didn't have lunch that day, so I was super hungry. So, I ordered the Menage a trois, which the lady working there said was the sandwich of 2008. The sauce was BBQ, mustard and honey, and was perfect. After that, I split a big steak sandwich with my friend, which was also bomb. I was still a bit hungry, but know that the sandwiches are good-sized. On a normal day, one sandwich would be enough for me.The lollipop was such a great finish.
MMMMMMM!!!I dont know anywhere else in the entire world where i can get a VEGAN sandwich called "we're just friends" with "dirty sauce".absolutely amazing. i dont really have to say anything else.
I love sandwiches. I am always up for a sandwich and can appreciate it in all it's variety - from simple to complex. My friends and I went to Ike's on Friday. Of course there was a giant line outside - which was amazing since it was freezing cold that evening. But this place is so good, it's worth standing (and eating) out in the cold for. I go the "Napoleon Complex" with Turkey, Honey Poppy Seed French Sauce, Avocado, and Havarti. Awesome sandwich, the honey poppy seed french sause was a bit sweet but the sandwich was still enjoyable. I split the sandwich with my husband who got the "Say Hey" with Hot Pastrami, Bacon, Swiss. This was also good, but I preferred my "Napoleon Complex." The fun thing about Ike's is with each sandwich order, you also get a lollipop. :)I can't wait to go back and try their other sandwiches!!
This place lives up to the hype. I got the "do you smell what barack is cooking" Rib eye steak sliced with gouda, bbq on sourdough. So good and filling. Best part 4-7 p.m. is happy hour, chips and drink included. My wife got the "hollywood SF cheesesteak" rib eye steak sliced with mushrooms on a french roll. Would go here everyday if I was closer. Worth a drive over the bridge. Looks like the other 50+ sandwiches would not disappoint.
Dear Ike's: is this what food in heaven is supposed to taste like?I'm glad I insisted on going here during my visit in San Francisco. lets get the downs out of the way before I go on about this place. So the only thing really down about this place is that there is no parking for the tons of people of that come here. Also, as soon as they run out of stuff, you become quite limited on what you want to add to your sandwich. they close early and they aren't in san diego. :( Okay, onto the good it was our turn and i still couldn't figure out what i wanted so i felt rushed and ordered something else only to find out that there wasn't much left (no lettuce or avocado), so i went with the "Stupid Eggplant". I'm glad I did. It was soooooooooo delicious. Breaded eggplant with marinara and provolone. WOWZA. I added tomatoes so I could say I had a little bit of raw vegetables. I would recommend it on the dutch crunch bread and would recommend with extra dirty sauce.My friend, who hates eggplant, had this and LOVED it! He ended ordering the shawn michaels which is basically a heartattack in a sandwich. But I couldn't even take a bite of the half that was given to me after eating my stupid eggplant.overall i'd recommend going here but make sure you check out their website for all the items that aren't on the menu you go there.
First I'd like to say the have the best sandwhich I have ever had! I don't know whether it's the dirty sauce or what, but I was incredibly impressed! A few weeks ago a few friends and I went to SF for an outing and Ike's was on our list. We had a total of 2 cars which made it hard to find parking since all the parking there was is on the street. The car that I was in got annoyed and decided to head back to our hotel, while our other friends found a spot and decided to wait in the long linke. My fav ended up getting a roast beef sandwhich (roast beef, I would never order) with avocado ( & i hate avocado) and shared it with me. I took one bite and wanted more.I will definitely stop by everytime I'm in SF.
Moved to the city a few weeks ago and we've been twice already. Tried 4 diff sandwiches between me and my boyfriend and they've all been outstanding. Fast service if you can deal with waiting in line. A must if you're in the area.
A meatball sandwich with Mozzarella Sticks?!?!?! A Buffalo Chicken sandwich with Jalapeo Poppers?!?!? Thee was so much hype before I tried this place I thought there was no way...but it BLEW MY MIND. Every sandwich I try here keeps getting better. This place needs to be on every college campus in the country....this is a goldmine.
The kryptonite is by far the best sandwich I have ever had in my life. I think the dirty sauce is made with crack. I have never had a sandwich even come close. Ikes crack-den is a must stop if you are ever in the area. I will be offended if you don't like this spot. Yes it's that serious. Lol
Best sandwiches I have ever had! I highly recommend placing an order by phone to reduce the amount of time you wait for food.
Thank you Ike's Place for tickling my tastebuds like no sandwich has done before! It was my first time going to Ike's and I had to wait 45 minutes in the line for the Meatless Mike but it was finger licking awesome and worth every second of standing in that 85 degree heat for. When I took a bite of the sandwich it was like an explosion of the most delightful comforting italian meal in my mouth. Dutch crunch bread and huge meatballs covered in cheeese and a sweet and herby dirty sauce. Simply amazing. I didn't know fake meat could taste that good! So I sat near the Bay taking in the cool bay breeze eating that thing with dirty sauce all over me with the seagulls all huddling around waiting to get in on some; they didn't get a crumb! I didn't care about all the funny looks i was getting from the Marina folks it by eating it like a savage..it was just too frikkin' goood! In addition to the awesome friendly service, I was very impressed that there were several Halal chicken options on the menu which means I am DEFINITELY coming back for more! I just have to remember to call ahead next time...
Best. Ever.I had the M.I.L.F.
The backstabber........... nuff said!
Ike's is a repeat favorite among colleagues and myself; we gladly squeeze cross-town trips into our lunch hours to acquire their hand-built masterpieces. These are more than simple bread stacks; they are a revolution in the Art of Sandwichery. If there wasn't already a business by the name i might even call them 'wichcraft.Ike's sandwiches are built on top of delicious bread, perfectly loaded with a flavor-explosion of exotic (and standard) ingredients. I've had their rib eye ("For a Gouda Time Call Tiffany B.", rib eye, horseradish, gouda), their meatball sub ("Montana to Rice", meatballs, marinara, pepperjack), and now their chicken parm ("Curtis!", chicken breast, marinara, provolone) and none of them has ever disappointed.Ike's: best sandwiches i've had on the west coast.
A Menaja Twa has never been better!Caution Note: Saturdays and Sundays are a tribute to secret sauce, being hung over and standing in line. Be smart and this is avoidable. Until the smartness kicks in I will continue to be dumbfounded by art of the sandwich and the ignorant bliss of the masses.
I just HAD to give this place 5 stars! My boyfriend and I barely made it to Ike's before they closed. There was a line as we drove by. But once we got there we were 2nd in line. I got the 'Going Home for Thanksgiving' and my bf got 'Paradise Found'. There sandwiches are to DIE for. In 'Going Home for Thanksgiving', they have this special spicy sauce that just makes the sandwich what it is! I would DEFINITELY come back, and I most likely will. I'd want to try GHT again, but my senses are telling me that there other sandwiches are just as good. Go to Ike's! :)
I don't get the big hype about this place. Don't get me wrong, the sandwiches are good, but they're not orgasmic or anything like that. They're just good. It's just that it's so hard getting to this place. The parking in that area is horrible, and when you finally get parking you gotta wait in that line. The line was actually shorter than I expected it to be because I didn't realize it was so small on the inside. So besides like 2 tables outside, there isn't any seating for you to enjoy your sandwich after having circled the place for like 20 minutes just finding parking. Maybe it was the sandwiches I ordered or the nature of sandwiches in general, but they get soggy fast. I just didn't feel it was worth all the trouble for a soggy sandwich that you end up eating in your car or on the curb. On the plus side, they give you those yummy caramel apple lollipops with your sandwich. I almost gave it an extra star just for that...
This place makes the most delicious sandwiches EVER!Don't go without the dirty sauce...it makes your trip all worth it.They have great variety on their menu and friendly service. The wait and line can get really long. We usually call ahead. I've had it be 45 minutes or longer. (obviously, the word is out!). The Pizzle is my fav. Mmmm.
Thanks, Ike's, for ruining the sandwich experience for me. Every other sandwich I eat is mundane. I don't know why I even bother eating a sandwich from anywhere else these days.I wasn't even that big a fan of sandwiches before I started coming to Ike's. I would tear my ass away from my desk at noon every day and go "hm, turkey again, I guess."As I write this, I've got a turkey sandwich from some other place sitting on my desk, and I wish it were from Ike's.
Although, I have not gone back yet I was contacted by Ike apoligizing for the service I recieved. It meant a lot to me that he cared about what people had to say and wanted to make it right. Thanks to Ike's personal attention I will now try it again.
WoW. Not the game that Koreans and Cartman dominate, but the reaction after biting into a sandwich stuffed with "Thinly Sliced RibEye Steak, Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers", otherwise known as the 92, the Hot Date for Hire, and boy did this date put out.If heart attacks had a taste, this had to be it. The idea of putting jalapeno poppers on a sandwich... I mean, you can only compare it to the invention of the round wheel. A square 'wheel' worked fine, but the round wheel... game-changing. Following other reviewers' advice, I ordered ahead, grabbed the sandwich about 45 minutes later (which was hand delivered by the owner), sprinted home like an escaped convict, tore off the wrapping like an 8 year old kid on Christmas morning, and consumed it like a fat kid with cake.If Yelp allowed me to give half stars, Ike's, you would get it on top of the 4 already given.
Today I ordered from Ike's Place for the first time ever. I had heard of them from Man vs. Food but as I'm not typically in SF that often, I haven't had the chance to eat there. Some guys from work decided to drive out there and pick some up for our team and I ended up getting the Menage a Trois.  The sandwich had Halal chicken, honey mustard, honey, bbq, pepperjack, swiss cheese and smoked gouda. I can honestly say this was the best sandwich I've ever had. The meat was extremely tender while the addition of the honey and other sauces made it finger licking good. It was juicy but wasn't overly messy and the french bread was soft with a bit of crispiness on top.  The combination of the bbq and the honey (and honey mustard) just made for an absolutely delicious concoction and I can't wait to have it again.If you plan on going between the hours of 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. however, you will want to order in advance as they're about as busy as H&R Block on the final day of Tax season. Well worth the wait though!
Only you can decide if waiting an hour plus for the best sandwiches you will have ever tasted is really worth it. On a recent Saturday, I decided it was, and was not disappointed. The next day I called in an order, which really seems like the thing to do -- you'll have to wait to pick it up but you won't stand in line. Extra: the staff is extremely friendly, accommodating, and does not rush you, which is a surprise and an added plus for sure, given how busy they are. And Ike actually works there, handing out orders and introducing himself which is just nice. Basically, believe the hype. Best sandwhiches ever.
My hubby and I went here last sunday we ordered the meatless ike's sandwich and I must agree that there sandwich is good..It took a while to ordered but It's all worthed to wait..Try it folks..
I heard all the hype about how awesome this place was so my co-worker, andrew, and i just had to try it out!! we called in for an order to pick up and they were extremely nice on the phone... within 10 minutes our sandwiches were ready! They definitely lived up to the expectations! We ordered the Vegan Not So Sloppy Ike and the Vegan Meatless Ike both on sourdough with everything on it! I loved every bite!!! =)We thought the prices were a little high for sandwiches but it's definitely worth it!And to both of our surprise we found two lollipops (blow pops to be exact) in the bag!! love it!! It's a great place to go for veggie and vegan sandwiches!! i'm excited to go back and try the other sandwiches they have!
I've been to Ike's for take-out sandwiches mostly but today I had enough time to order a sandwich (actually three) for a us to sit down and eat. It's so interesting how at Ike's Place sandwiches really are the focus of attention. Alex is giving Ike a break of sorts and is manning the register, and patiently explaining every detail about the food here. It's fun and definitely a wonderful way to have lunch. Eating at Ike's almost feels like hanging out at home, except that I can't make sandwiches that are so delicious at home. The combination of original and fresh ingredients, plus the best bread ever, makes the food here an amazing experience. I had the "Say Hey" , pastrami, bacon and cheese, which I'd suggest if you're not watching your waist. I wish I could eat two.Thanks to Ike and company for such a great place to enjoy the best sandwiches in the City.
Ike is like a home run hitter. With every sandwich, they go all in, throw in the kitchen sink, and it makes contact, the ball is heading out of the yard.My got-to sandwich here is the Lincecum, and here the baseball analogy continues but really breaks down. The Lincecum is a hot sandwich loaded with turkey, ham, avocado and bacon. This sandwich absolutely blows you away and leaves you wondering what hit you. Honestly.You'll thoroughly enjoy the sandwich while you are devouring it. But afterwards, the sandwich is so heavy that you'll wonder whether they snuck a baseball bat into that sub.I would give this place 5 stars, but not all the sandwiches are a home run. They do well, mind you, but not all blow my socks off and one is set up to expect when heading to such a respected institution.Tip: Add sriracha to your sandwich.
it took my 9 year old nephew to discover this place for us!! What a great place!! Not only are the sandwiches amazing but the service is incredibly friendly. Each one is beyond creative and the special sauce really does make to crave even as you are still eating!! we are probably going back tomorrow!!!Really love when you see successful businesses to still take the time to care for the clients, explain and even offer to take a photo of the entire family eating!! thanks for the great treat!!
Do believe the hype. (Sorry, Public Enemy.) Ike's sandwiches rock. Except for the Dirty Sauce, the ingredients aren't particularly notable, but their preparation is. For one thing, almost any sandwich is improved by being heated up. Said Sauce is delish. On my first visit here, I ordered the Barry Z., which has turkey, avocado, and havarti, on Dutch crunch bread, with all condiments. I was not disappointed.I can see that the wait can be a problem, even at 2 p.m. on a weekday. (Funemployment.) And the place itself is tiny, and only part of the menu is posted on the wall -- I do recommend browsing their site to figure out your order ahead of time, if you can. The people who work there really hustle. The clientele seemed to be strangely dominated by Mission hipster types (skinny jeans, '80s glasses, ugly footwear).A damn fine sandwich. (Disclosure: I too learned about Ike's from "Man v. Food," despite having frequented this area a lot in the years before it opened.)
After reading all of the reviews I decided to check Ike's out for myself...Jalapeno poppers on a sandwich.....Fuck yes.I ordered the MILf and my husband had the Nacho boy. I also love that they have Cel-Ray soda.... one of my favorites.Call your order in.... the line was out the door!
yum!!the wait was really long but it was fairly worth it. but i'm generally a patient person?? hahhayes, there was a line and yes, ordering was kinda rushed but the workers and i assume ike himself (?) were very helpful and patient given the circumstances.anyway, we got the tony soprano and jerie's (sp?) all meat sandwich. the bread is nice and toasty, soft, warm, delicious!the dressing and meats/veggies were well put together and i was very fulfilled.i almost wanted to order another sandwich - one more for the road! oh, and i never tried chai cola until i visited here. it's pretty yummy! i like it better than green tea cola :Pi would definitely come here again :)
The Menage a Trois is a must try! Juicy chicken on top of their Dutch Crunch smothered with their top secret dirty sauce. All that sweet honey goodness dripping everywhere with each bite. Oh ya.
I can say nothing bad about the sandwich I got here. My little sister actually found this place on yelp and chose to go there for her birthday lunch. I took her and we both got deeeeeelicious sandwiches. I want to go back really badly actually. The sandwich place is a little hole in the wall- so small that the line is usually out the door after a 3 people back up. They set up tables outside. Even though it was really crowded (obviously a popular stop) our sandwiches were made quickly considering. They have a wide selection of sandwiches, all cleverly named. The bread was really yummy. Go get a sandwich!
Food: 3.5 starsService: 3 starsAmbiance: n/aOverall: 3.5 starsWhat an interesting experience. Luckily, we read the website and knew to call in our order ahead of time. We live 40 min away from SF, so figured that'd be enough time. But woe to us, it would still be a jaw-dropping hour and a half before our order would be ready, calling in at around 11am saturday. So, we got there early, walked on Castro Street, saw a couple of naked men with less than banana hammocks on (not appetizing, trust me), then walked to Ike's to pick up our sandwiches. At least they let us cut ahead of the long ordering line to pay and pick up. Ok, on the sandwiches. Hubby got the "Eli Manning" on dutch crunch. I was expecting a solid piece of chicken breast, so I was a bit disappointed with the chicken salad texture. And the bread wasn't the typical dutch crunch... it had no golden crust. I got "The Joker" on Sourdough which was pretty tasty with flavorful sauces and good balance of meat and veggies, and the bread held up better than the Dutch Crunch with no sogginess.I would go back to this place if I was in the Castro area, but a sandwich is not worth the risk of sitting there getting soggy if i don't pick it up at exactly the right time (12:55pm to be exact). Next time i might get the Superman or the Doomsday.
I think I can eat Ike's 7 days a week and I might not get tired. Its DA bomb! If you are in SF and even if you're only there for a few hours, take the time to go to Castro and check out Ike's. Whatever it is that goes into the dirty sauce, its amazing! I think they have an iPhone app you can use to order ahead. Pick up your order and walk to Delores Park and enjoy your day.
Best sandwich place, EVER! At some point during this summer, I had ike's every single Thursday for about a month. I miss those days. Grab a sandwich, head over to Dolores and enjoy one of the best sandwiches you will ever have in your ENTIRE life. Granted, they sometimes mess up on orders if you and your friends/person who ordered before or after you order the same thing - simple stuff like mixed breads/mixed toppings. Nonetheless, IT IS STILL THE BEST. Even if they mess up on my breads, I still can't seem to not love this place because EVERYTHING IS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. You have not experienced a real sandwich until you have come to Ike's.
Long line of people, store crowded with waiting patrons, staff super helpful and friendly, sandwich yummy, overall experience great!
Not really sure I'd call it a sandwich, but tastes great!
Wasnt any seats outside, but atleast i got to order the kryptonite! 5lb. Sandwhich looked like it was 2! A little heavy in the lettuce, but then again it was heavy on everything else too! Definitely reccomend for the experience of eating a giant sandwhich that was featured on man v. Food!
I love sandwiches! But it's always hard to find a good sandwich that makes a good one where the bread isn't too soft or too hard. Or that the meat should be pink/red and not green. Plus easy selections where your taste buds choose for you and not your brain. So anyways, moving onto delicious sandwiches...I'm one of those people who get lost easily and of course the city has a lot of good food but limited parking if you don't know where you're going and such. But at Ike's I will always be determined to find parking just for a tasty delicious sandwich. Even if it's a mile walk, I'll make someone carry my heavy ass! It's that great! (Now I feel very sorry for that person, muahaha!)The last time I was there, or actually my first time at this place. There was a long wait and when I mean long wait, I mean lunch hour with people not only standing inside the little crowded place but also all over the side walks in front and across. One of the smart things they did was treat my hungry friend to a bag of potato chips for the long wait. I on the other hand waited and got potato chips better than Lays!I got myself the "Hot momma" one because for one, I thought it was a hilarious name but two. I like the sound of buffalo sauce. But my friend got the Hollywood SF Cheesestake. Omg my Hot Momma was good but the Cheesecake SF Stake was so much heaven that I thought I was resurrecting and then dying and then resurrecting and then dying again because it was just too good!A lot of places in SF or anywhere actually get hyped up but I think this place is actually very good because of sweet, salty tastes that we enjoy in life. Of course the wait is long but don't you wanna savor and wait for the taste of your sandwich? I actually fine with the long wait, the place is busy with a strong wave of fun energy.
Amazing. Best sandwich I have ever had from a sandwich shop.I stood in the rain for about a half an hour, and it was totally worth it. Everyone was really nice and Ike brought sandwiches out to people who were waiting, in the rain! The dirty sauce is sooo good. I will be coming back next time I am in the city.
After hearing about this place from a few friends, I finally had a sandwich from here. And I've got to say...They were spot on with all the hype and descriptions. Ike's Place is every bit as good as people say. And the high ratings are well deserved. With sandwiches named Nacho Boy, Lincecum, Al Bundy, Damn Straight, and others, This place has to be good. I had the Superman sandwich. I recommend this to any meat lover, as I am one myself. The Superman containing: Roast Beef, Corned Beef, Pastrami, Salami, Turkey, Bacon, Ham, Avocado, and Jack. Needless to say, I hope and will be getting another sandwich from there in the very near future.
My kids saw this on Man vs. Food so we had to pop on while visiting SanFran. The sandwiches were super delicious and plenty big enough. We actually shared because my kids are light eaters and they were jam packed with ingredients. Very good flavor. Only reason I'm taking away a star was there was no where to eat. We kind of pulled up a chair and ate in the lobby area only because it was so cold outside & we came on foot. Take the plunge and go. Your tastebuds won't regret it!
I'm not sure what the hype is about or how it obtained over 4000 reviews but it taste just like another good sandwich from a good deli. Id have to say they use a very tasty mustard in the sandwich. Perhaps that is the secret ingredient which stirs people up. I don't think it's worth $10-11 per sandwich. $7-8 sounds reasonable for a good sandwich from a ToGo deli. I personally wouldn't go back since its about 50 miles from home and expensive for an ordinary sandwich.
One of the best sandwiches by far. Totally worth the drive. We parked a couple of blocks away and walked to the shop. Highly recommended! It's SF, parking is always an issue. We enjoyed a nice stroll over to the shop and went at an odd time so snagging a seat inside the shop what a breeze. Love ya Ike's.
Best. Sandwiches. Ever. Gotta love a place with great sandwich recipes and a quirky feel to it. I had the 16th and Market on Dutch Crunch bread and my mouth is watering for another as I sit here and write about it. The bread was delicious and all the ingredients complimented one another perfectly. Thankfully the sandwiches come in a paper wrapper which reduce your chances of wearing pieces of your sandwich. And you get a caramel apple sucker to satiate your sweet tooth and make you feel like you're in 7th grade again!Boyfriend got the cheese steak and was much less impressed. Yeah, it'll set you back about 10 bucks, but I'd rather have a single sandwich from Ike's than 2 $5 foot longs any day of the week!
Standing outside this tiny shop, proudly holding a Mengage-a-Trois half in mouth and half in hand, is like reaching the summit of Everest. Such euphoria at your achievement, yet tinged with a note of melancholy, for you then realise that from this mighty Sandwich Summit - no matter which direction you look - every other sandwich place is only going to be downhill.
I'll give it to them, definitely a good sandwich. I had the Nacho Boy, which was action-packed with goodness. I see what the hype is about, and the place has charm -- it's literally a hole in the wall, and they have very SF things like t-shirts of George Bush saying "I hate Ike's".But, presumably thanks to Travel Channel, the line was pretty ridiculous. Granted, we went on a sunny Saturday around lunch-time, but no sandwich is really worth an hour wait.
In it's second, well maybe third location, this institution of sandwiches is worth the wait because there is a reason why the wait times can lead into the next meal time allotment. According to Ike, they sell over a 1000 sandwiches a day. I say he's being conservative with that estimation. Try the "Name of Girl I'm Dating". The dirty sauce is amazing. The choices can be somewhat overwhelming, but this is the best place to get a sandwich in SF.
Victim of their own success? I so wanted to like or love this place. I live walking distance and crave a great sandwich sometimes. I will give it another shot, but honestly, it was a let down. Sauce was drenched on the #7 making the dutchcrunch mealy. Chicken was dry and unappetizing, the cheddar parsimonious. Sandwiches are about proportions; too much mustard, unripe tomatoes can kill a sandwich. Ike's scales may need some (minor) recalibrating. They are the up and comer, but still have a ways to go until they catch up to places like "East Coast West" on Polk St. Dunno - maybe with wild popularity, comes increased production volumes and inevitably quality takes a hit.
Okay, so here's one more review to add to the thousands already on Yelp. I mean at the end of the day you just have to go try these places yourself instead of relying on a review, right?Yes, I saw Ike's Place on Man V. Food. and ofcourse the joint has gotten lots of press but I tried not to go in expecting too much. Plus I had been planning on trying it out even before the M v F episode. Here's why I gave it only three stars, though. The lack of meat in my Menage a Trois and my wife's SF's Hollywood's Cheesesteak left me very disappointed. And for $21 for two sandwiches I expected not a sandwich "stacked" with meat but something with a little more substance. My wife's cheesesteak looked like it had three extremely thin slices of beef (and the poor woman was eating for two (it's gonna be a boy, thanks for asking)). And my sandwich had a barely recognizable amount of chicken in it. The bread was fresh and tasty as was the dirty sauce.....no complaint there BUT Mr. Ike please consider adding a little more meat to your fantastically creative sandwich menu. It probably won't take too much of a bite out of your revenue.
If I were to write a love letter to a sandwich, it would be to a sandwich from Ikes. Not only is everything there DELICIOUS they are creative and unique. Hello? Fried mozzarella stick in the sandwiches, BRILLIANT!!!! My mouth waters just thinking of Ike's- and I can bring my veggie boyfriend, because they have extensive options for the meat-free. Enjoy your sandwich and your tootsie pop (they come with every meal) made personally by Ike and say hi to his mom (the hot mama hooda herself) who works there with him. Oh, Ike Thank you especially for: Hot Mamma Hooda MILF and We're JUST Friends
We saw this shop featured on Man vs. Food... DEFINITELY lives up to the hype... Thank you Yelp world for suggesting dutch crunch... absolutely the BEST i've ever tried! We ordered the Menage a Trois, Name of a Girl I Dated, & a Sexy Boy. The Menage Trois is the sandwich featured on Man vs. Food: chicken, honey, honey mustard, bbq, pepperjack, swiss, gouda goodness- SO DELISH... Sexy Boy had mozarella sticks in it, thought it would be interesting combo w/ ribeye slices... not as hearty as the latter, but an ok choice. What to expect: Sunday afternoon, about an hour wait, in line... although we saw some smarties picking up phone orders & I think that's the best way to go from this day on.Hand down, the BEST sandwich shop we have ever tried... so good, we had to sit on the sidewalk & devour the stuff right away... I'm just sad we didnt know of this bay area gem sooner...
I like Ike's. I also liked that it was 2 blocks from my house.The sandwiches have creative names, and they're loaded with good stuff. If you can get there at a non-peak time, go for it! You can enjoy your sandwich at Dolores Park! If you can't make it to Ike's at a peak time, I'd skip it and get a sandwich from Bi-Rite's deli counter. (Their sandwiches are super-duper delicious :)
Elvis Keith is da bomb!
I was finally able to try out Ike's sandwiches early this month! I've been wanting to go here since he opened up, but never had the chance.I had the King Koopa and boy was it filling. It was jam packed with meatballs, mozzarella sticks, jalapeno poppers, and marinara. The meatballs were delicious. I could have just eaten those alone and be happy.My boyfriend had the Shawn Michaels (thinly sliced ribeye steak, mozzarella sticks, and bacon) and loved his sandwich. I can't comment much on his since I was stuffed from my sandwich.We both got dutch crunch for our bread which was warmed up nicely. They always give you a lollipop with your sandwich. =) Makes me happy because they are the only the second place to give me a lollipop. The day i went they gave a cotton candy lolly because they ran out of the caramel apple. =(I didn't experience a long wait and I came around 3pm during a weekday. There were maybe four to five other people in front of me and it took at most 15 minutes to get my sandwich.I will be back! Maybe I can convince my boyfriend to take me here for Valentine's day weekend. =)
Great sandwich. Great service. Must come back
This is probably one of the few places I believe lives up to the hype.It's a small shop that packs like the biggest crowd every day. The menu itself is just hella vast for a shop like this that it seems that there has to be something on it that will suit any given person that enters this shop. The ingredients they use edge perfection & altogether with the given bread (recommending: Dutch Crunch) create an amazingly constructed piece of the Bay Area's version of sandwiches fit for kings. Damn! That's a crazy analogy, but it's true! When I speak of its amazing construction, the sandwiches are just packed so well that making a mess is almost nonexistent! It's gold.The service is excellent. They manage to keep up with a huge crowd pretty well. One lunch I was there, they accidentally forgot to give a man part of his order, & one of the workers ran down 16th chasing him to complete what he's missed. That's quality service!And you get a caramel apple pop with your meal!..But I'm kinda upset Man v. Food is about to air this place. It's about to be thrown over to the hipsters.
A good friend of mine and me had our take out lunch from Ike's Place. He had his Matt McCain and I enjoyed once again my Tony Soprano. Ike's Place was very busy and customers were crossing lines, but I stood ground at the phone/web order line to get our lunch. Ike himself recognized me and saw my lunch on the pick up cart and called my name to aloud to let me know my sandwiches were ready and at the counter to pay and pick up. It was once again very delicious sandwich luncheon. Thanks again Ike. Hi5
OMG OMG OMG. These sandwiches are little pieces of heavenly goodness. You want scrumptious, delicious, nearing sinful indulgence? Have a sandwich from Ike's. I ordered a big platter of assorted sandwiches for a work meeting yesterday. Their customer service was great, though Ike was trying to steal my scarf -they have personality =) -just like their sandwiches. I have never seen so many vegetarian or vegan options in my life. The sauces are mmmmmmgoood. Recommend the veggie meatball sandwich for one and the other veggie turkey, artichoke and I believe pesto was mouth-watering as well. These sandwiches were a hit. Now I know what the persistent line outside of this place is for.... understood. And.. I'll be waiting. MMMMM!
Best sandwich I have had in the city. Who cares if you have to wait 20+ minutes? I soaked up the sun out front and waited for my name to be called. The other patrons were really nice and offered my beau and I their table so we could chow down until their order was up. I would suggest the "Jim Rome Turkey" which has Ike's Red Pesto, Avocado, and Cheddar. I wouldn't have tried it but the guy behind the counter said it was his favorite. He was so right! You can't go wrong asking for suggestions in a place like this cause the options are endless. I will be back for another delicious sando.
I recently stumbled upon Ike's after hearing friend after friend rave about it. They are also 2 blocks from my house so I saw no reason to not go! I called in my order ahead because I heard their wait at lunch could be upwards of 30 minutes. Good thing I did to because it was! I went and picked up my #9 (Name of the girl I'm dating) and was BLOWN away. I've never had any sandwich like Ike's! It was hot, melt in your mouth amazing. After that first trip I went the next 5 days in a row at lunch time for the same sandwich! Let alone they have like 100 other ones I can't break my habit of the first one I tired! I really want to try something else, but I keep getting the same 'ol, same 'ol!Ike's is a truly amazing place to get a sandwich and an experience as all their sandwiches are so unique! Anyone that doesn't mind a wait for what will possibly be the the best sandwich of your life, go to Ike's!
great sandwiches. make sure you order on the iphone app beforehand
Service: 3/5Food: 4/5Wait: 2/5Price: $Presentation of food: 4/5Presentation of restaurant: 3/5Overall: 4.5/5I had their #2 Hollywood San Francisco the first time i was there. Then the second time i had their salmon sandwich #13. Both really gooood. Its honestly THEIR sauce that MAKES the sandwich soooo greeeat. if u have the sauce; u're SET!
this place is a win!! i can almost guarantee you that any sandwich that they make that include " the dirty sauce" would be absolutely delicious !! unless you request for no dirty sauce, not sure why anyone would do that.. but yes! this place is definitely one of the top sandwich places that come to mine when i have that craving for a sandwich! Cashiers are always friendly, the wait has dramatically improve since they've moved over to the new location "down the block, across the street" along with all the wonderful sandwiches, they have creative t shirts that they sell to fan's of ike's sandwiches ! like i was saying.. this place has the best affordable sandwiches available in the city of san francisco in my book =)
I did not think that Ike's could get any better (see my previous review), but indeed it has. Free chips and a drink if you buy a sandwich before 7 pm on a weekday evening (Monday - Thursday). And they have french fries?? Mind. Blown. I also think the line has died down a bit since the post-Man vs. Food surge, so yay. And I hear rumors that they are franchising, but I don't want to get my hopes up until I see it. (Pssttt... Financial District location, pretty please!!!!)
This place has some of the best sandwiches in the city. So delicious and they have a large menu with a large variety of sandwiches. I recommend ordering your sandwiches ahead of time and then picking them up because this place can get pretty crowded.
Had to get the Menage a trois, as I am trying to finish the 7x7 2010 Big Eat list. We also got the Matt Cain, in support of the Giants. My girlfriend and I waited for about 20-30 minutes to order, but you have to keep in mind that it is part of the deal when you go to places like Ike's or Pizzeria Delfina. I might call ahead once I get to know the menu better. Also, sign their petition for support as they have a lawsuit Getting to the sandwiches, they are very delicious, unique and the one's we had were not only the healthy side. Each bite was filled with flavor and having them hot was a great choice. The dirty sauce is fantastic. I get it isn't for everyone, but it is for a large percentage of people who enjoy what Ike' represents they know how to make a sandwich.
I'm a couple days late on my review but ... Ike's Place- I had to see what all the hype was about so I made a stop after the Carnaval Festival (which was a big disappointment but that's another story). LoL I searched for this place on yelp but didn't fully read the reviews so I didn't prepare myself on wait time.When I arrived the line was out the door with about a dozen people standing on the curb waiting for their order. The girl who worked there came out and gave us the menu and informed us that the wait - just to order was atleast an hour long. I honestly thought she was exaggerating..I mean how long does it take to make a sandwich right!?But the last laugh was on me..It took about an hour before we got to the front and another 15 minutes waiting for our order. But I think it was well worth the wait....I had the Fat Basterd which was a lil salty for my taste due to the ham and bacon but besides that it was delish! I also tried the Hot Momma Huda and I must say the chicken breast tasted sooo good!The staff who took our order was super nice!!!!! and Ike (the owner) even took time out to introduce himself and joke around with us. I would give Ike's five stars but I had to leave it four stars although it was worth the wait.. it was still a bit long to wait for a sandwich.
it is the dirty sauce. yumfor 2 ppl, just go for the gold, get the $20 sammich, full of meat and HUGE....I've called in my orders, i recommend that...usually takes about 20-30minutes... so u call in, go in 20mns later, poof, in and out like that =)
I met THE Ike today! Haha. The lines were bustling with people. The sandwiches are great, seriously, they are. They don't skimp on your ingredients, either. I got tons of avocado, which i LOVE.One of my friends and I both got "Name of Girl I'm Dating" (chicken breast, honey mustard, pepper jack cheese) with no mayo. Really yummy! Also a very healthy choice. Our other friends had Pride of Castro and Nacho Boy, and they were both very impressed.Yes, it's pricey for sammiches, and the wait truly is long (We ordered at 11:30AM, picked them up at 2), but if you know you want a sandwich, just call in advance and you're good. The lady who took our orders on the phone was very personal and sweet. Grab a sandwich and head over to Dolores Park on a sunny day. Ahhhhhhh.
Amazingly Yummy sandwiches. Will definitely go back!
Delicious!! I finally tried Ike's place and I'm sold! As a vegetarian, their meatless meatball sandwich was awesome. Very flavorful, moist and full of yummy marinara sauce. My fiance hates fake meat and amazingly, he loved the sandwich too.I would recommend calling your order in and then swinging by for pick up. I called on a sunday afternoon and they told us to pick up our sandwiches in 30 min.
Okay, (it's been awhile)You really can not honestly review a restaurant (in a whole not just a single sandwich) on just one visit.My first impression was that Ike's Place was a great sandwich and you could order anything on the menu and not go wrong. . . that and the service SUCKED Ding Ding = Donkey Dick,at the time it was sharing a spot with a night club so after we waited in line to make our order we quietly sat at a tacky by daylight booth (area) to wait a good 15 mins for our paperbagged sandwich and let me tell you we were one of the first few people that ordered early.That was 6 months ago,. . .today was the same story. When I first saw the "restaurant" featured on TV it was very deceiving that it was an actual establishment and good ol "Ike" (Now probably counting his money after outsourcing his work load to hungry hipsters), was actually there on the premisses joyfully making your sandwich to order rather then a high watered, skinny jeaned, bearded,minimum waged, friendly brontosaurus tattooed "hipster" make it for you while he/she made sure their vintage looking (btw who wears a beanie in 65 degree weather working in a kitchen) beanie was not clashing with their argyle socks for your Loooooooooong wait (like always for the order 20 mins) and they get it wrong, THEN offer me the extra sandwich that they got wrong, THEN when they bring the corrected order the snarkly chuckle and hollywood fake smile and explain that one of the workers (who can make their own damn sandwich) "begged" to have the extra sandwich for his/her lunch break WTF!!!!!!!. . . FAIL!. . .all this when earlier i was in Sausalito driving into the city, and tried many, many times to call in my order(since only being their one time previously, knew that their service sucked) just to hear that they are not answering their phones, (but when i am there i do not notice one person actually answer a phone order) and i call a shit load of times and it just RRRRRRAANG!id like to take this time to quote the a little 1986 film by the late great Mr. John Hughes "Ferris Bueller's Day Off""I weep for the future!" - the Chez Quis maitre-d' (Jonathan Schmock)PS Ikesorder a S -LOAD of Med/Large shirts because (as common sense dictates) they are the first to go.. and try to make the design interesting i.e all the framed ones on the wall rather then just the boring sports team parodies. LOVE the # 3
Sometimes, you read a highly rated yelp restaurant and you are utterly underwhelmed. Ike's is definitely NOT such a place. Best sandwich I've had. Ever. I got the Matt Cain. I didn't see it on the menu, but a friend had suggested it to me. It was sandwhiching heaven. Turkey, salami, roast beef with all the veggies and a game-changing "dirty" garlic aioli. Every bite is just gushing with flavor and the dutch crunch bread was just perfect. They are pretty good sized sandwiches too, definitely hit the spot.The wait can be long - we waited ~ 35 minutes at 3:30 PM on a Sunday, but the end result is worth it. You can also call in, which would probably a better strategic move.
I am not a super sandwich fan, but this place is good tho. The wait is long, at least 20 - 40 mins, but I think it is worth it. I ordered the shrimp and crab sandwich, very unique and the portion is huge, so I can't even finish the other half of the sandwich. We came here on a warm afternoon, it was easy to find parking, just circle around, don't pay for the meter on Market st, the one hour free parkings are just around the corner. I like how they give you a lollipop, and the service is wonderful. I heard you can order your sandwich on the phone and pick it up later on. So hopefully it'll save you time!
I went to Ike's today for the first time in a few years, and, oh my god! I had forgotten how good the sandwiches are here. I got the Tony Soprano, which has turkey, ham, salami, italian dressing, dirty sauce and all the veggies on it. The combination of dirty sauce and italian dressing was so good! The prices may be a little higher than a "regular" sandwich shop, but I can only eat one half at a time so it's really more like 2 meals for me. Another note on the devotion to this place: It was raining pretty steadily earlier too, and the line was still 10 people long. They love it here!
ike's is not my thing. i got the veggie meatball sub and the two sauces (dirty + marinara) made for a very soggy lunch.
Always order the Mission PZ Burger as I love trying different burgers around the city. I definitely love these burgers with everything on them.Employees there are always cool and it sucks that a bunch of NIMBYs may ruin one of the better places in the city. Would be cool if they could have outdoor seating, but hopefully they'll open up somewhere else in the city that will welcome them with open arms.
Never had a sandwich that tasted so gooooooood. I am not normally a sandwich person so you wouldn't catch me at Togo's or Quizno's during lunch.  However you can take me to Ike's anytime.  My boyfriend whom is a vegetarian took me to ike's a couple of months ago.  I was overwhelmed by their choices but settled on the classic #19 with some minor changes.  # 19 is basically a Turkey Day feast stuffed into a sandwich, Turkey, Cranberry and Cheese on Dutch Crunch.  I made mine into a veggie Turkey since I knew my bf would enjoy eating my leftovers.  I also asked for Brie instead of the standard cheese that it came with.  I liked the fact that the staff had no issues with substitutions at all.  They were more than happy to make you happy.Today we both ordered the #19 and this time the bf added veggie bacon and pepperjack cheese.  BACON yummmmm. I like veggie meat but I still love my meat!  The bf gave me a piece of the veggie bacon and I was surprised at how similar it tasted to real bacon.  It even had that smoky fat taste of real bacon.  One of the staff also recommended to add Sriracha to make the sandwich spicy.  However, I don't think he put enough of it! I only wish that they had more seating area besides the chairs and tables on the sidewalk. It can get crowded fast and eating standing up can be uncomfortable. One last thing about Ike's is that they include a Tootsie Roll Pop with the sandwich. My idea of dessert as well!  The kid in me was truly satisfied. Oh and they don't serve coffee anymore since people complained how awful it was.
This place has received loads of media hype. Don't wait in line if coming here, just phone in your order-- it's all take away anyway.The cleverly named sandwiches are not artfully crafted. They are massive piles of messy undifferentiated flavor, what someone succinctly referred to as "stoner food."We had a [Name of the Girl I'm Dating] and a M.I.L.F. They didn't taste all that different really, both dripping in dirty sauce.Portions are big, but the prices ain't small.
I liked this place because of the clever sandwich names...However I did not like how there is no seating provided and I didnt enjoy the taste of my sandwich which was "Do You Smell What Barack is Cooking/Change". It was soggy and undelectable, not like the actual prez.
tried the new location.the sandwiches are great.  the wait is pretty bad (with a short line I still had to wait 20+ minutes even after they'd taken my order).New location still very little seating, so had to eat my sammich elsewhere. My advice is to avoid busy times, unless you're prepared to wait quite a bit.They could really use a full-size location, it seems like they have the business to support it.
Get the Sometimes I'm a vegetarian ! but add avocado to it!
Great place good food a little pricey for what you get. I'm still a fan of little Lucca as their bread is delivered from the bread factory near by. I still like Ike's as they offer a huge amount of things to order
As it stands now, Ike's Place has nearly 1200 reviews on Yelp and 4.5 stars average. There is nothing more that really needs to be said. Consider this review just another hash-mark in the "Awesome" column.The girlfriend and I went at the right time... (6:30pm on Saturday right after the first rain of September) and there was *no* line. The dude behind the counter, Alex, talked me into the Menage-a-Trois and the girlfriend got the "Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian"My sandwich was amazing. And insanely, hers was even moreso. An all vegetable sandwich that was simply divine, and worked together so well you couldn't tell it lacked meat.Thank you for the good recommendations, Alex. We're already talking about coming back.
I popped my Ike's Place cherry today with an Al Bundy.I shouldn't have waited this long. They make a great f-ing sandwich.In a neck and neck taste race with Sub Center for my favorite sandwich in The City....I begrudgingly (i'm a pseudo-loyalist) concede victory to Ike's Place.They take it at the wire with creativity.
Dragged my 5 and 8 yr old daughters and my wifey to this place. Not from SF and not familiar with the area. Equipped with GPS and map, still had problem finding this place. I finally found it just before the girls were ready to push me over to the oncoming trolley.Yes, the sandwich was good. Wish the place had sitting places. Would I try again? Yeah, why not.
Yelpers got it right again....AWESOME Sandwich!I got there at 9:45am and there was already a line. My only suggestion for this place is to move into a bigger space and to streamline their ordering process by providing a menu. Other than that...it's worth the wait in line.
I take my sandwiches seriously and it is great to find a restaurant that does as well. I ate the 16th and Market sandwich and everything about it, from the bread to the sauce, was fantastic. My only criticism is the long line. If you're going to Ike's, try and do it during off hours.
After wanting to try this place for the longest time I got to give it a try today...it was AWESOME!! Having a sandwich on freshly baked bread really makes a huge difference and helps make everything taste amazing!I called in my order and surprisingly it didn't take long at all until I was able to pick up the entire order. Everyone that works there was extremely friendly, too. I mean, I don't have a bad thing to say about the place!
Spiffy Tiffy. Do it! Dutch crunch FTW!
A must go!Food: Awesome! I got the menois je tois. It was great, everything has dirty sauce in it, but it is definitly far from dirty and much closer to awesomeness! This is a must try sandwich, and im assuming all the other ones are just as awesome. The long line is proof enough of how tasty their sandwiches are. People: The cash register guy was swamped with orders and i had to repeat myself at least 3 times, but it was well worth it. The crowd around here is very hipster and hoidy-toidy which can mean dealing with both an awesome crowd or a condescending one. Most people here though were very chill, just eating the great sandwiches on the sidewalk having a good time, you can even head up to dolores park to enjoy your meal picnic style. Ambiance: on a nice weekend day buy a sandwich, go to dolores park, bring your dog, bring your friends, and have an awesome time!
Ike's sandwiches don't strike me a very San Franciscan. They have an indelicate, highly caloric,working-class sensibility. The Tootsie pop in treat that they include with your order isn't an ironic addition -- it's for real.Ike's sandwiches are entirely delicious, but not artisanal.
Um... I want another, I want another. Is pretty all that comes out my mouth now that I have experienced Ike's sandwich goodness. A buddy of mine took me there last week for an afternoon lunch.. and at 3pm there was a HUGE line outside and at least 30 people waiting to be fed by Ike. At first, I was like... how good a sandwich be? Boy was I wrong. I ate the meatball sandwich and it is by far the best one I have had in this city. Tip: If you are craving a little bit of Ike's fabulousness, I would call ahead for your order, or you might be waiting a while. Seriously. A while.
i ordered the "say hey," which was a great sandwich, however today it didn't hit the spot the way i thought it would. i probably wasn't in the mood for pastrami as much as i thought i was. i'll be back to try others though.if you all notice, the bread isn't thick nor dense here. i think they might dig out most of the inside of the bread first...that way the fillings stay in rather than squish out. it's always a plus when you don't have to piece your sandwich back together after every bite.
I'm a hot sandwich person, so I split an order of the Will the Thrill (Louisiana Hot Link) and the Montana to Young sandwich. The Hot Link was incredibly good or it could be a function of me waiting in line forever and feeling hungry. The meatball sandwich was okay....the sauce that they put on there was a cross between some thousand island dressing with tomato flavor. I didn't like the combination between the meatball and that dressing.The atmosphere was quite fun since I had time to stand in line and get to know the people I was there with. There were a bunch of people dropping people off to get in line for sandwiches and picking them up afterwards. Lots of dogs running around, very neighborhood feeling. I would come back again and try all the different sandwiches they have there.
I just moved here from Philadelphia and have been mourning the fact that I will no longer be able to get a good sandwich and a nice slice of pizza (which I still haven't found). Ike's was a pleasant surprise. It can not compete with a proper hoagie from Sarcone's or Primo's back home, but that is because it is a different beast. I get the impression Ike drinks a lot, because all of these sandwiches seems like someone came up with them when they were drunk....and it just works. Ike may well be a genius.If they put dirty sauce in a tube, I would brush my teeth with it. If I could put jalapeno poppers in everything I ate, I would. That said, the sandwich wasn't a world beater like everyone on here makes it sound like. It is very, very good...but not great. It is good because the crazy combinations, but sometimes I just want a simple sandwich.I like that they put a caramel apple pop in the bag, I always forget about it until I am done and wishing I had something sweet.
Walk in and out kind a place. Grab your favorite sammie and head towards twin peaks or parks in the area. i had the Timmy it was sooo good! love this place and will go back. Also great choices with sodas!
I haven't actually returned to give it another try, but the update on the review is based on Ike having reached out to me to inquire about my experience. All I can say is WOW, a place that actually reads their customers' feedbacks, definitely 3 stars as a starting point! I will update again once I go back for my review of the entire experience.
Dear Ikes, I love your whicky wacky sandwiches and the fattening sauces you put on them. Tasty! I love that you serve gluten free bread. I love that its hot! :)
Ike's makes some of the best sandwiches on earth. With over 3,000 reviews, what more is there to say? I got the Reuben, which had the most amazing orange sauce on it. If your in SF, you can't miss Ike's.
F**k me.The next time I walk in, I might be waiving money in the air and asking them to flash me their fake bacon.It has easily warranted 3 visits in a 36 hour period.I am looking forward to trying every sandwich that I can.Not looking forward to possibly having to sell myself for lunch money. They're not terribly expensive, but the addiction I can see myself slipping into is what will do me in.Flavors.Textures.Excellent sandwich construction.Served with a lollipop!And a tasty soda selection, including a variety of root beers; even a raspberry lime rickey soda.And the guys who work there AREN'T dicks, which is what I'm used to in lil' delicious sandwich shops- usually the standard trade-off. But they're both funny and nice, to the max.Allow me to illustrate:I was just there yesterday, during the downpour, and the guys were nice enough to bring in a table and dry it off so that my friend and I could sit and eat inside, which is something they don't really do on the daily. Everyone else who came in had to grab a sammie and scatter away into the rain, and who doesn't enjoy feeling a little elite every now and then?(For those of you who haven't been to Ike's, it's quite small inside and there's only seating outside)These guys make me want to throw extra tip money at them, as if we weren't in a recession.
a) funny namesb) crazy combinationsc) dirty chips come with your sandwichd) and you also get a lollipopAlso, just fyi, they are really good for hikes. Like so good. It's everything your dirty, tired self will want. I ate a few bites while it was warm and then packed the rest for a 11 mile hike. It was STILL good (just a bit soggy).
Been coming to this sandwich place for some time now. My first experience was good enough so I've decided to come back for a second try. My second attempt lead me to third and the rest is history. My review is based on its menu, pricing, and location.Much Ado About Something.From Napoleon Complex, Do You Smell What Barack is Cooking? to "Hella" Fat Bastard, when it comes to picking a sandwich, there's nothing better than looking at a quirky menu. When you look at the menu, you can't help it but to give yourself more time to browse through the names and check out what the sandwich is all about. The long line during peak time (11a-3p) helps alot if you have time to spare. However, don't be fooled by its off-the-wall names as Ike's boastfully proclaimed, these are some serious sandwiches. The menu ranges from Meat lovers, Vegans, and meat alternatives. One of my all time favorite is the "Hollywood SF Cheesesteak" on a dutch crunch is to die for.Is that a change in your pocket or you're just happy to see me?Sure we all heard the $5 daily specials but are they worth it? It depends on what you're looking for. Ike's place begs to differ. Typically, the average price is $8 and up. If you're looking to enjoy your 1 hr lunch without any compromise, there's always something to explore besides the other $5 footlongs. The sandwich also includes your choice of "Dirty Chips" and a lollipop. Just be careful not to gag.Location. Location. Location.Though it would be nice to have a spot in downtown or financial district, Ike's Place is conveniently located in 16th Street. It is one block walking distance south from market street. It's a cozy and less spacious spot. You can always find the spot easily as customers wait in line outside the place. If you hate waiting in line, you can call ahead to give yourself a privilege or an excuse not to be in line for pick up. Parking can be a pain sometimes but there's always room for patience.As a picky sandwich eater, there's nothing more gratifying than to grab a very good quality sandwich you can enjoy. Maybe it's the dirty sauce in their sandwiches. Maybe it's the lollipop. But there's nothing quite like Ike's place for your taste buds to really enjoy. I really like Ike.
Amazing... seriously, & super nice employees
Glorious. Dutch Crunch is a marvel of modern baking.
Honestly, if I could give 6 stars I would. Whatever the dirty sauce is on the samiches it's heaven. I say, make it dirtier and slather it on there, baby. I've had the CA BLT and they did a perfect job. The bacon was tasty and used moderately so that I could appreciate the other ingredients. The other fave of mine is the Meatless Meatball. I can't even describe it. You must try it because it tastes so frikken delicious! My mouth is watering just remember that sando. I love that they use a reasonable amount of meat and cheese rather than piling up all of the stuffings so you can't differentiate them from each other. I also like how all of the ingredients are spread evenly throughout the sando and not just in the middle. Good sandwich making is serious business for me and many times it gets screwed up when sando-makers are in a rush. This is the only sandwich place that I make plans to go to but you kind of have to unless you're lucky enough to live within walking distance. We call our orders in and pick it up in 20-30 mins. You have to expect a wait, even when you call in. Ike's is a closet on the street, there's no place to sit and they are BUSY. Look at all of the fans on here. So, make sure to recognize that you're in for a wait.
I found this place by using yelp. The service was really fast and the people here are really nice and the ambiance is great too, you can tell people love this place. I tried a Elvis Keith, although I don't like Wasabi Mayo the sandwich the was good, the bread was really tasty and it tasted very good, highly recommend this place.
This place is epic. Honestly I couldn't imagine a better place to eat during an exhausting trip. I was staying at my g/f's parents house in San Carlos after an amazing ski trip and I was craving the ultimate man food! After seeing great views on yelp and on the tv show Man vs. Food I knew that not only was I going to drive into SF but the only way to go was to order the KRYPONITE!!! The sandwich was at least 3 pounds and every bite was incredible! Honestly enough for two hungry people!CALL YOUR ORDER IN!!! (my order took 2.5 hours to make!)As for the experience, I would give Ike's Place 6 stars. Parking usually is hard to find and there is always a line down the street, but the wait is worth it. Ike is usually there and he is more then willing to give you a firm handshake as he passes you your sandwich.
I want to be supportive of local business anyway I can. When I heard of Ike's landlord troubles I was rooting for him all the way. I had eaten there a few months after opening, and although the sandwich didn't suit my taste the service was fast and friendly. It is local so I was committed to trying again.My second trip to Ike's today was disappointing on every level. The service was terrible. The sandwich was gross, in fact, stomach churning. I won't be going again.The service: First, despite only two people in front of us I waited seven minutes for our order to be taken. We ordered and told the register person we would be waiting for our sandwich outside. After about 10 minutes we wondered where our sandwich was so I went in an asked if the sandwich was ready. At this point an Ike's employee informed me there was a 30 minute wait for the sandwiches!!!! Upon realizing I had just paid $10 to wait for a sandwich for 30 minutes I couldn't decide what to do. Should I request a refund? I asked an employee if this would be possible, but got no response. About a minute later a 20 to 22 year old guy came out and announced he was the manager and was there to help. When i told him it was ridiculous that making a sandwich should take 30 minutes he tried to blame me for the problem. He asserted that on the menu it states that there may be a wait for the sandwich. Then he told me the website warns of the 30 minute wait for an order. Next he told me they prioritized phone orders and there were "literally hundreds" queued up in the back. Finally, he told me that baking the bread took time therefore increasing the wait time.I told him three things: 1. Ike's is not the French Laundry. There is no acceptable reason to take 30 minutes to make a sandwich. Bad planning and bad kitchen management can be the only legitimate causes. If you need fresh bread for the rush then plan to make enough bread to meet the rush. It doesn't take a genius to plan for this. Kitchens all over the country deal with large customer volume and lunch rushes.2. Don't tell a customer, who is standing in your shop, that he was wrong in not having prepared for the visit by reading your website. Don't try to excuse your poor service by blaming the customer for not reading the website and therefore not knowing it would take 30 minutes to get the sandwich. All that information should be available at the point of sale for cash and carry business like Ike's. A big sign saying "30 minute wait" should be posted or the order taker should tell customers when they are ringing them up.3. Don't use the volume of your phone orders to account for your slow service when I can easily verify your statement. I was standing in front of your shop for 30 minutes, watching all comings and goings. For your assertion to be true there should have been 25-50 people that walked in, picked up a phone order, and walked out. Instead we counted three.None of the original Ike's Castro staff was there--they'd all been replaced by 18 to 24 year old hipsters. I hate to say it but these new employees' work ethic may not match the owners.Most importantly, the sandwich SUCKED!!!!The Girlfriend You Name has shredded chicken, supposedly with avocado (plus the other sandwich stuff). I couldn't find the avocado. There was so much of some liquid on the sandwich that the bread was totally soaked. The dutch crunch had no crunch. In fact, it as about 1/4 inch thick from being so wet. By the way, we only carried it a block down the street to sit down and eat. I finally figured out some of the Ike's supposed secrets: First, they toast the bread with garlic butter. Second, they key ingredient in the Ike's sauce is Miracle Whip or an equivalent, accounting for the sweetness. These things all so overpower the sandwich it is impossible to enjoy the fundamental ingredients.So, here's the takeaway from Ike's: Pay $11, wait 30 minutes, and get a gross sandwich.
I would take the absurdity and hassle of making an appointment for a sandwich if the food was just.that.good.  As you can tell, I found the whole "appointment" requirement totally annoying. IMHO, a business is allowed to impose this requirement ONLY if: (1) the sandwiches are made in heaven by angels themselves; or (2) are genuinely world-class. My sandwich was fine, but not amazing (case in point -- the greens = nonorganic iceberg lettuce, only). I would give Ike's another try but will likely be too lazy to make an appointment and go somewhere else.
As all the reviews say, this place is AMAZING! Definitely my go-to spot when I'm in the area..the sandwiches are always consistent in how they're prepared and the staff is great. The wait's not long and they also take phone orders, which is great if you're in a hurry.
Awesome. Don't even spend your time considering if the trip is worth it or not. Just go.FREE chips that are awesome, and the "dirty" sauce is pure bliss. Best 10 bucks I have spent at any food establishment, anywhere. The service is extremely friendly and top notch too. I'm becoming a regular.
Right around that corner, there is a sandwich shop. They sell meatball sandwiches. Best I've ever tasted. Would you go get me two? Come on partner. Two. Thank you... Utah, get me TWO
Love it, love it, love it!Sandwiches are creative. It seems no matter what combination you order, it never fails to put a smile on your face.
Along with the other 1000 people that love Ikes, I'm 100% on board. I don't know what it is that set this sandwich shop so high above the rest. I have always fancied myself as a connoisseur of sandwich construction. Sure, I thought I could hang with the rest of them. But Ikes -Shoot.... is surely on another level. While they cater to just about everyone: carnivore, veggheads, and vegans, Ikes truly has something for everyone. At my first visit to Ikes I was advised to call in a order, and for my friend to wait in the car whilest I cut the long line and pick up my piece of heaven stuffed between two pieces of bread. So I did. Here is my concoction.Turkey, Bacon, Avacado, Lettuce, TomatoI know, i know... Its completely unoriginal. I'm sure you, your mom, your mom's friends have all had this very sandwich at a 1000 places in your respective hoods. Why was this sandwich soooo good at IKE's. I don't know. I just don't.  But believe me when i tell you that.... IT WAS.Big ups to Ikes for keeping it Proper
Oh the meat. Man this place packs a sandwich like I have never seen before. I finally had Ike's for the first time one dreary Saturday afternoon. We decided to call our order in since we heard about the lines. First off, it took a lifetime to decide which sandwich I wanted. I finally settled on the "Change", chose a sourdough roll and asked for the BBQ on the side.When we got there I was STARVING and ready to eat. We picked up our sandos and biked to a park. Now the sandwich. The bread is hollowed out to make room for the fixins, and oh was it divine. Warm rib eye, still crispy onion rings, smoked gouda and their version of an aoli (dirty sauce). My only complaint was that they forgot the BBQ sauce but really, who orders it on the side? My bad. What to try next??
It's not overrated.It's amazing.Do it.Thank you Ike, I will be back once or twice a week from now on.PS.. If you don't want to wait in a long line just call your and order your sandwich before you go. I called at 3pm on a Saturday and they said they could have it ready by 5:30.. Perfect! I came at 6 and it was still hot and delicious! We had a six sandwich order.
Too much of a good thing roils Castro neighborssfgate.com/cgi-bin/artic
I'm convinced that when the Lord Jesus comes back to Earth the first thing he will say is "Let's get one of these Ike's sandwiches I keep hearing so much about"Great sandwiches every time with a friendly staff and good prices. I count myself lucky to live nearby Ike's.
Bomb sandwiches. My go to in SF
Great sandwich spot! delicious sandwiches! awesome if you want to grab a sandwich and sit at Dolores Park. Staff is funny and friendly!
Amazing! It's hard to not get the Mnage  trois every time because the sauce and meat are so good. Combine with some Dirty Chips Funky Fusion flavor and you're golden.
Ike's is awesome.Friends are in from Texas and wanted to check out Ike's so we went by this evening and it was fantastic.The staff were friendly and helpful and the food was incredible. I got the No. 9, which is officially called (Name of Girl I'm Dating), with everything. It was served on crisp, flavorful sourdough bread and featured glorious fresh avocado, honey mustard, chicken and pepper jack cheese. Fucking awesome. Every sandwich on the menu looks and sounds great in its own right and I can't wait to try many more.Big ups to the very helpful, mucho kickass dude cleaning tables and helping me wrap up the second half of my huge badass sandwich to go.Big ups!OH, and awesomely low prices, to boot!!!!!
Neat place with creative names for their sandwiches. If you're smart and call your order in, you'll have a better experience. This place is very popular. My order was ready for pick up after an hour.I ordered "Change", a sandwich that had thinly Sliced RibEye Steak, Beer Battered Onion Rings, BBQ and Smoked Gouda on a wheat roll. Another sandwich was the "Unoriginal Roast Beef", a good baseline sandwich. The sandwiches were okay, nothing special as advertised with their promotion of their "dirty sauce".Certainly could get better. I'll have to give this place a few whirls to get a full read on how good it really is as people Yelp about it.
We were looking for an awesome cheap lunch in SF on a random Saturday when my friend suggested Ike's. When he told me it was a sandwich shop, I said "it's a sandwich, how great can it be?". I thought I knew this city pretty well. I thought I knew that mind-blowing lunch-food doesn't really come in the form of a traditional sandwich. I was wrong about both. Ike's is simply awesome. The long line and wait aside, the sandwich here is more-or-less epic. I had the Hasta La Vista Baby, which was a steak sandwich with hot peppers and a spicy version of the famed dirty sauce. It was really great. Both of my friends' sandwiches were also apparently great, even the guy who ate the veggie sandwich with fake meat loved his.SF's cheap lunch mystery has been solved.
What is not to love about Ike's? The sandwiches are enormous and delicious. I never thought a sandwich could be considered gourmet until I came here. This place is always a treat for me. The sandwich bread? OMG talk about foodgasm. I have never had more delicious bread in my life! During lunch time they have happy hour so not only are you getting a fantastic sandwich, you also get scrumptious kettle chips (I don't even like chips, but man I have a new found love of KETTLE chips), and a drink! Not only do they have vegetarian and meat sandwiches, they also offer up vegan sandwiches! PERFECT for SF considering how trendy it is to be vegan and vegetarian here...My personal favorite is the Name of Girl I'm Dating-chicken, honey mustard, pepper jack cheese, and avocado. YUMMY! If you are ever in SF, this is a place you HAVE to stop by.
my friend Chris raved about this place last weekend telling me how awesome the sandwiches are. I am very judgmental about deli being of the highest new york jew pedigree and I take sandwich making serious. I walk into Ike's this morning.1. the three cutest most charming boys were working there .I was overwhelmed by all the sandwich choices in front of me ,and Jesse(or is it ie?) helped me navigate and pick something that i'd love. 2.I got the Tony Soprano and it was just what I wanted. Delicious Turkey and Salami(i held the ham) goodness with italian dressing on toasted dutch crunch with all the fixings. I will make it a point to come back once a week maybe....for the sandwiches and to go flirt with hot ass Jessie(se?) ;p
I've been on this sandwich kick lately and it's been fun trying to hit different spots around the city during work lunches. While there are numerous sandwich places with at least a four star rating on Yelp, this is one place that surely shouldn't be missed. It was even on Man vs. Food and I am positive he knows a thing or two about which places to visit.The line was seven people long when we got there with 10 people waiting around out front for their orders. Only two small tables outside and only a counter inside leaves no place to eat there. The selection was pretty large with creative combinations of chicken breast, turkey, ham, veggies, etc. Next to that is the "Non-creative sandwiches" which were plain, single meat choices with all the fixins. They even had a $5 bare bones option for student budgets that didn't include cheese.I ordered the Tony Soprano which was turkey, ham, salami, provolone and fixins on a sourdough roll. My buddy got the plain turkey without cheese on a wheat roll. We waited out front for 10 minutes as the masterpieces were created then took them in the car back to the office. The Dirty sauce, a garlic mayo, was really tasty and made the sandwich. They both came warmed just right and the sandwich exploded with flavor with each bite. The Tony Soprano actually tasted like a meaty pizza with no sauce and it was heavenly.It's been a bit over an hour now since I ate and I feel very satisfied, if not a bit sleepy from the food. I bet it would have been even better if we sat there and ate rather than waiting 10-15 minutes.This is definitely not your typical sandwich spot/deli, but a sandwich experience...
This place pops up as the #1 restaurant when you search SF for food. Kinda forces you to try it...I arrived at roughly 12:30PM on a Sunday afternoon expecting a nasty long wait...There was no line at all, after ordering 2 sandwiches we found a table immediately and sat down. Weirdly, we still ended up waiting about 20-30 minutes. So, looks like part of the problem with the wait is how long it takes them to crank out each sandwich.With that having been said, I'd rather wait 20-30 minutes for a sandwich which tastes fresh with great bread than to go to Subway, wait 5 minutes and get tasteless food.On to the food...I ordered a veggie sandwich - avocado, sprouts, cucumber, tomato, lettuce and cream cheese on wheat. This is a pretty straight forward sandwich, hard to mess up as long as the ingredients are fresh. They did not disappoint, the toasted wheat roll was very flavorful and perfectly warm and toasted, the cucumber crisp, avocado perfectly ripe the whole sandwich pretty delicious. I might recommend that they offer veggie cream cheese to give this sandwich extra oomph, when you order a veggie sandwich, sometimes it lacks enough salt.My husband ordered #2 - the philly cheesesteak. It tasted nothing like a philly cheesesteak, but it was actually made with real steak + fresh fixins, which was great. He said he liked it because it tasted homemade.The service was really nice, Ike himself was there when we visited. He mingles with the customers, definitely comes across as enjoying his work and wanting his customers to enjoy the experience.All in all, 2 sandwiches, a bag of chips and a bottle of water was about $20. Food is good and fresh, nice service, sunny day...I would most likely go there again.
My coworkers were making fun of me that I Yelp & that I had never been to Ike's (and honestly didn't even really know that it existed!)We took the 22 on a Sunday around 2pm & we mentally prepared ourselves that we would probably have to wait a while for our sandwiches. We arrived & there was hardly a line...only two people in front of us (although there were a bunch of people waiting for their sandwiches outside). My mom & I split the Meatless Mike (vegan meatballs, jack cheese, marinara, with everything on it except mayo, on dutch crunch), my dad got one with bbq'ed beef. The total was around $20 for two sandwiches, two bottles of water & a soda (well worth it).We waited outside for about 20 minutes (not too bad) & people watched while we waited. Finally the guy came outside and called "Barry"! He made sure we had the correct sandwiches & saw that there were 3 of us, so he added a tootsie pop to our bag!We took our sandwiches & practically ran to Dolores Park (because we were a. hungry b. didn't want our sandwiches to get cold & c. it was really windy out). The sandwiches were delicious! You couldn't even tell the vegan meatballs did not have meat in them. The sandwiches were juicy, delicious & of course a little messy. You even have the tootsie pop to look forward to for dessert!I will definitely come back to Ikes on a warm day, when it's warm enough to eat outside (since you have to eat outside, no tables inside, only 3 outside). I would definitely recommend calling your order in, then you don't have to wait as long (I guess we were amateurs).
Everything you want in a sandwich. Awesome bread, generous and exciting toppings, and the best staff. Every time I've been there is a line but it is never a problem because this place has it dialed in. Spend your time in line trying to decide which flavor you want to try, give your order (special order? Not a problem), and step to the side and wait. They've never messed up a order of mine, they are always super friendly, and each sandwich comes with a caramel apple sucker for dessert! Boom!I love the Pride of Castro with turkey, ham, and brie (add the red pesto) but the CA-BLT with avocado is pretty damn good! My new goal is to work out hard enough to justify adding mozzarella sticks or jalapeno poppers to my sandwich. Someday...
A 45 minute wait for sandwiches on top of a 15 minute wait to order on a Sunday afternoon sounds pretty crazy huh? Well not crazy if you're waiting for an Ike's sandwich.Ike's Place is the place to go for a great $8 sandwich. I had the Hollywood's SF CheeseSteak on toasted Dutch Crunch bread. Friend had the Name of Girl I'm Dating which I heard was quite tasty as well.The friendly staff really knows how to make a sandwich and how to move the line efficiently. If it weren't for the food and staff here, I wouldn't find myself waiting an hour to eat a sandwich in five minutes.Lesson learned: call in your order beforehand!
After many days (weeks, months?) of wanting to try Ike's, I finally went today! The place is uber small (though adorable) so it can get really really busy with long lines, etc.; but my sister and I went at 11am (beat the rush for the awesome sandwich!) and it worked out perfectly. Plus then we had time to sit outside and "people watch"... and by this I mean critique drivers' attempts to navigate the special roadblocks due to construction. Yikes.But, on to the actual food! I had looked at their wesbite online and so ordered my Nacho Boy (swiss, roast beef, mushrooms, avocado) without a stutter, but I somehow doubt you could go wrong here. The sandwiches are tasty, HUGE and full of lovely vegetables and pretty much anything else you'd want. Ike's also has a cute selection of independent soda brands along with those of the dreaded Pepsi Corp. :o)Definitely worth the hit to the wallet (especially as half a sandwich can easily make a meal and then look, you've already bought dinner!) and the possible wait.
good sandwiches, but not great. If you are foodie traveler on a visit to SF, you should definitely stop by. It's not as good as I expected it to be based on all the rave reviews, however.
New favorite sandwich: # 91 Pastrami! It was perfect. The French dressing heavenly. As always, the service was top notch. Thanks Ike!
I don't know what to say...this place has changed the way I look or even bother eating at other sandwich places. When I say nothing compares to Ike's Place sandwiches I really mean NO OTHER SANDWICH PLACE COMPARES to Ike's!! I usually get the backstabber on dutch crunch bread. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!! If you haven't tried it yet you are really missing out on life!!
the place itself is not so charming as the sandwich i ate. there's about 9-10 seats for waiting the sandwich to-go, and you might not want to eat your sandwich here just because in here is always crowded so it's not a place to eat.there's always lines of people, and they all are hungry people that can't wait to eat the sandwiches.i ordered vegan ugly owl, basically it's vegan swiss cheese + vegan chicken + tomato + lettuce + some sweet wasabi sauce, i can't really taste that much wasabi and this sandwich is yummmm..........satisfying to my hungry tummy!! i chose dutch crunch bread and it's a lil crunchy on top, nice!! all bread are vegan except for the wheat, but i think dutch crunch is the best!they also include the chips to go along with your sandwich, i chose cajun dill because it's vegan. i love everything vegan.next time i want to order something else like vegan meatballs on dutch crunch bread.when i think about this place it does make me smile because they're vegan/vegetarian friendly.ike's place, i will return soon :)
I had SF GIANTS.It was good but I didn't think it was THAT great...I might go back but I like Little Lucca in South San Francisco much better.
Ike's Place vs. Sub CenterIT"S A TIE!!!! I cant get enough of both these places.side note - Ike's is Little Luca done right!!!
Love this place. Great sandwich spot. I especially love the superman sandwich.
Don't even read this, just go there. I'm serious! Do get online and look at the menu because its expansive and even overwhelming at times. I've had several offerings and love them all. Go with a friend and share to get the best experience. The Vegan Meatless Mike always satisfies. The Backstabber (turkey or vegan) is wonderful and I think I had the Eli Manning a few times ago. Honestly you can't go wrong with good bread, great quality fixin's, all kinds of messy juicy delicious sauces, and kind friendly TLC putting it all together.To further sell you, Ike is awesome, his staff from day one has been great, and his mom is in the mix and she's cool (you may even see her around town picking up produce!).Now, Ike, lets talk about franchising a location in the inner sunset...
A little trick of the trade: phone in your order ahead of time and go to pick it up about 20-30 minutes later. Otherwise, expect to wait about that long and have no place to sit/eat. This is the only reason why I'd give it a 4 instead of a 5.Other than that this place is a delicious gut bomb for sure. I shared the MILF sammie with the bf and it was more than enough to keep us full until dinner.Make sure to check out the online menu before you go to order because they only have the first 20 or so up on the board in the store. OH! And you HAVE TO get the dirty sauce on your sandwich. Trust me. Or don't and be sad.
Well, I must say, this place absolutely lives up to the hype! Waited 40 minutes outside to order and get my food, and it was worth it! You may want to call ahead to get your food faster, but the line really wasn't that bad.If you are a fan of meatball subs, I highly recommend the "King Koopa". It comes with all Beef Meatballs, Mozzarella Sticks, Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers and Marinara. I couldn't believe how delicious it was :)If you find yourself in SF, you should put this place on your list to check out! Highly recommended!
I'm new to the area and searched around for a vegan food option in/near the castro, and Ike's came up. We tried the vegan meatball sandwich on italian bread and it was *amazing*! The blowpop was a very cute touch, too :)The outdoor seating (nothing indoors) would be rough on a colder or rainy day, but we had nice weather and enjoyed it.I'll DEFINITELY return (and maybe even try something different).
My sandwich was delicious, no doubt. I had my boyfriend's exgirlfriend, or something like that...on a dutch bread stuffed with jalapeno poppers. And I was pretty full afterwards, for sure. But $14 for a sub? I don't know... i felt like it's just one of those good sandwich places that get a lot of hype because it's in the Castro... or something? I don't know? The line was out the door even at 2pm on a regular day. My friend thought her sandwich was a bit sloppy. My other friend liked her sandwich just fine. Service with a smile despite them being super busy (with togo and in house orders). If I'm in the area and craving a $14 sandwich, i'll hit Ike's again.
I'm not a sandwhich guy. I'm not into Dutch Crunch bread. And I rarely have any interest in a BLT. And yet, as fate would have it, my introduction to Ike's Place was a BLT on DC. Without getting into detail about how I wound up with a sammy I would normally not have anything to do with, this was a revelatory experience. I couldn't get enough of it and when it was done....I was sad. Actual sadness. If they can make me adore a sammich I normally wouldn't touch, I can only imagine the obsession I'd develop over the Tri-tip. My only complaint is that they have a sandwich named after Damon Bruce on KNBR. Can't stand that guy.....Ike's has to be, HAS TO BE, the best sandwich shop in SF. Period.
I want to give Ike's 5 stars, I do. It's a really, really good sandwich and the dirty sauce is yummers! I also don't mind the wait, which is why calling ahead makes everything so easy. HOWEVER...they consistently fail to get my order right-and it's not that hard. I got the Nacho Boy (my fave)...I said hold the tomatoes, peppers, pickles and lettuce and keep the onions (what can I say-I like them). What I got was a Nacho Boy with lettuce, tomatoes, peppers, pickles and NO onions. And I guess shame on me for not checking it when I picked it up, when I got back to the office I was BUMMED. Pickles and peppers have juices that can "stain" the taste of a sandwich, and who wants to pick shredded lettuce off their sandwich.At the end of the day, I will probably go back. Most of my friends are Ike loyalists, and are probably going to shun me after reading my review. Hopefully Ike's will get it right next time, one thing's for sure-I'm not leaving Ike's without checking to see what they gave me.
IT. WAS. DELICIOUS.I felt very, very awkward ordering my sandwich order, though. It was Halloween when I first went to this place and I was basically having my order taken from what I thought was Johnny Depp, and I had to say menage a trois. TWICE. It's not the definition of that word, but that it was coming out of a little girl which made it awkward for me.It'd be five stars for this awesome place but I was burning in line for like, an hour. I think they had nice free cold water inside, but I was in line with a friend and we were so close to the cashier by then that I didn't want to risk someone cutting me..by the way, the Menage a Trois was a lot tastier than the Pizzle.
Go now! Quick while there's time
Wow! Amazing!! I recently came back from a trip to San Francisco and a friend of mine insisted we go check out this place. All of us were thinking, how good can this place be...it's a sub joint. It was beyond delicious!! We ordered krypto nite sub and split it between 3 peeps. The sub was an explosion of flavor. Definitely sad that we don't have an Ike's place in Miami.
SOMEONE SHOULD CALL THE COPS!!! This Ike guy, whoever he is, is putting crack in these sandwiches. I got the Al Bundy with Dutch Crunch bread, omg, it felt like the first time I had sex. It was explosive, amazing and lasted about three minutes!!!The staff is super friendly, phoned in the order before I got there and these folks were just behind the counter chopping away at their delicious-drug infested ingredients. These folks rock. My wife even said I looked more handsome today by giving her my half of the sandwich, double gold stars for you IKE!!!
Ok....so besides the fact that I had a crazy tranny telling me all about her previous boyfriend and how he was avoiding her phone calls (gee, I wonder why), about how she's a 40 something year old cougar and how she kept drooling over the poor 20 something year old guy sweeping the floor, this place is great! I am in LOVE with Ike's sandwiches and will do whatever it takes to get some...including listening to a crazy tranny!
Ike's 'aight....4 stars rating means a lot since I'm not even that fond of sandwiches nor I'm overly generous or complimentary like most Yelpers. I think Ike's Place is one of those unique sandwich joint where it feels like a sandwich sweatshop... The place is so tiny from the outside to even tinier in the inside... no seatings.... expect to order, grab your sandwich and eat out in front of the store... We ordered Papa Sam with wild salmon and Jim Rome with Turkey. Everything was pretty much mushed together by the time we ate the sandwich. And everything was GOOD.... though a tad bit greasy...Our order even came with an old sticky kitchen clip left on the brown bag with our name & order description on a sticky note... something to remember Ike's by...
Clearly the best sandwich in San Francisco.The menu includes a large number of options, the sandwiches are creative and delicious. I have had a number a different sandwiches I have never been disappointed.A word of warning: allow 30 minutes to an hour for your phone order. 1. Go over to their website and choose the way to fill your belly 2. Call them up and place your order. 3. Wait the required time 4. Go pick up your sandwich 5. PROFIT!!!1
I tried this place for the first time yesterday. I had "name the girl I'm dating" on a dutch crunch, and it was probably one of the best sandwiches I have ever tasted. I would most definitely come here again when I am in the Sf area. Although the line is long, it is well worth the wait! The only con is that they don't put a variety of vegetables, and they put too much sauce in the sandwiches.
Can I start this review with O-M-G? The sandwiches we got here were out of control! This place is located in the neighborhood called The Castro. Expect to wait outside for 20 minutes or so. At least their employees bring you a menu to view while you wait. Reason they do this is because you order and pay right as soon as you walk through the door. We ordered the Mnage et Trois and the King Koopa sandwich. They were both ordered with with their Dutch Crunch bread. The Mnage et Trois had chicken breast, lettuce, tomato, three types of cheese, and a ton of their famous Dirty Sauce (as seen on Man vs. Food). I was super full eating the first half, but it was so good I ate half of the second half. My husband's King Koopa sandwich had meatballs, mozzarella sticks, jalapeo poppers, veggies and a ton of Dirty Sauce. We took it back to our hotel room since they don't have tables at Ike's. They have some lounge seats but it's mostly used as a waiting area.You can't come to San Francisco without making a stop at Ike's. They have all type of sandwiches there to choose from.
I'm not going to go into too much detail here about the food other than to say the menage a trois was superb! What I do want to write a review about is how great the staff here is. I came for the first time yesterday afternoon and of course there was a very long line. It was a hot day and Ike's staff was working very hard in a smallish space dealing with throngs of sandwich lovers. I was so impressed with the patience, kindness and efficiency of the staff. The guy with the shaved head who took our order was wonderful and genuine. I'm sure listing the bread options and the sandwich toppings options over and over again can get tiring but I detected no hint of impatience or rudeness and it just exceeded my expectations for such a busy popular place where you might expect people to be rude.  It was refreshing and made my first Ike's sandwich experience even better. Especially after some recent experiences with rudeness my friends and I had experience the night before (which I've also documented in a review).
I got the Menage a Trios, and my friend got the Lincecum, we split the sandwitches, and menage a trios was way better, and it was way more flavorful , and juicier, and the chicken was good. The lincecum was ok, definitely was shadowed by menage a trios, i recommend the menage a trios than the lincecum, and menage a trios was like 11, and lincecum was like 9 or 10, came with chips, and green apple lollipop at the end. My friend likes little luccas better, way bigger, and more cheaper.
Better than Subway or Quizno's? Definitely, I think so... This was one of the first places that I went to when I moved to San Francisco about a year back and I'm still going. It's perfect for a person on a budget or some one that wants a quick bite to eat. If your a carnivore, omnivore or a vegetarian then this place is 'THE' place for your tummy. As you can see by pictures, its a sandwich stand. One of my favorite sandwiches to order is the Number # 7 (The Pizzle; which includes: Halal Chicken Breast, Bacon, Ranch, Cheddar. I get it with the 'Dutch Crunch' Bread. For only: $6.96). Also, they started doing their version of "Happy Hour," as you get a free soda and bag of chips. Not bad for the economic crisis were in. The other thing that's worth to mention is their good selection of micro brew soda's. (during Happy Hour, their only a Dollar). Another thing you will find when you get a meal from Ike's is a Sucker, 'nice touch.' Conclusion: Recommend to friends and Family.            Inexpensive.            Great Food.             5 Stars!!!            ...Any Questions!?
Yuuummmmmm!!! What can I say about Ike's that hasn't been said. Hands down thee best sandwich in the Bay Bay Bay!! So many creative sandwiches to choose from. My tip is to look on the website and pick one before you order at the counter cuz not all the sandwiches are on the wall menu. Or even better call to Order for a pickup and save you some time.My pick of the day was #79 Shawn Michaels - Thinly Sliced RibEye Steak (Mmmm), Mozzarella Sticks (Holy smokes), and Bacon (smirking)!!! Woohoo it was hella grubbin!!! I had to pick up the hubs a little sumin' too. Well not so little, he ordered a #88 Superman - Roast Beef, Corned Beef, Pastrami, Salami, Turkey, Bacon, Ham, Avocado, Jack...Damn, thats a meaty sammy!! That dirty sauce they put on the sandwiches are on Hit!!! Gimme more!!!There's so many other creations I wanna try, I'll definitely will be back and call in first.
So I got the recommended menage a trois sandwich and I was blown away. At first I thought, $13 for a sandwich?! That is crazy, but then when I ate it, I totally forgot about the price and decided it was worth it for the best sandwich I have ever eaten! The flavors in the sandwich kept changing. It was like the everlasting gobstopper from Charlie and the Chocolate factory. Every bite was different and delicious. I didn't want the sandwich to end! Luckily it was pretty big so I felt super full. I hear that the place gets pretty busy so it was recommended to me to call my order in early in the morning in order to avoid any long lines. I am taking everyone I know to this place!
Spiffy Tiffy w jalapeo poppers on Dutch crunch bread! And free dirty chips w each sandwich! Awesome.
Oh Ike's Place, how I love you. I drive from the Richmond District to the Castro just to grab one of their sandwiches on one of my days off. Last sandwich I ordered from there was the MILF on Dutch Crunch and have not had one disappointing sandwich yet. Try to avoid going there around 12-2 or call ahead. Lines are usually long. Also for those of you that work late, if you call ahead of time they can hold your sandwich until an hour after closing. Awesome. Just be sure to eat it while it's hot and freshly made... Mozzarella cheesesticks are so horrible when they cool down... :(
get the Kryptonite! every time I go to the city, I LOVE getting this sandwich! it is so big and massive, but definitely WORTH your money! it has 13 different ingredients and it is ridiculously good!!!! I can barely keep it together when I eat it but it is sooooo worth it. And on top of that, every time I come here Ike is always working hand delivering your sandwich to you. Such a great guy!!! And they have awesome shirts that support the San Francisco Giants and 49ers!!!
I had to give Yelp's top rated sandwich shop a try, especially since it is a place my boyfriend (who has been everywhere as I've mentioned before) that used to live down the street from hasn't been to. It was as great as everyone has been saying it is. The very creative people at Ike's truly understand that a sandwich is equal to the sum of it's parts, resulting in really delicious sandwiches. The bread is perfect which is almost half of the equation right there. I will definitely be back for more.Thank you to the 620 people before me who loyally yelped them and pointed me in the right direction. I will have to be better at yelping myself and not just raiding the site for all of your suggestions.(Oh did I mention their awesome selection of rare soda pops!)
Sadly the day I finally went to try ike's place out they were out of chicken :( BUT they were super friendly about it and I really wanted to have the [name of the girl I'm dating] so I just ordered it with turkey instead! Still it was pretty amazing! Ike's dirty sauce is great! it gives you a taste of garlic and mayonnaise and with the honey mustard and avocado gave me an explosion (yes, explosion) of flavor in my mouth ;). But now I have to go back and try the sandwich when they have chicken and eventually I gotta try their other sandwiches since they all sound SO GOOD!
One of the best ways to ever eat a sandwich
ive heard tons of raves about this place, and boy did this live up to its reputation. GREAT sandwiches!!! i'm so excited i found an awesome sandwich stand! ike is right behind the counter with his friends, personally overseeing the sandwiches being served. i didnt know that his mother also helps out at the shop, which is a pleasant and adorable surprise. here's what the conversation we had with her when she brought out our sandwiches outside: "thanks for the sandwiches. do you own this place?""no, he does," ike's mother pointed at the window, indicating ike. "but i own him." we all laugh. "he's my son, so of course i own him," she continues. great sandwiches, friendly people. i think its really charming that this small sandwich stand is run by family, serving unbelievably rich, tastey, messy sandwiches that are to die for. highly recommend the "name of the girl i'm dating." chicken sandwiches dont get yummier than that.
OVERALL: I wouldn't waste my time to give this place another chance. If you like sandwiches, don't waste your time here. I realize I am going against the trend with this review, but as an AVID sandwich connoisseur, hear me out: SERVICE: We went on a Saturday morning: RIDICULOUSLY BAD! First there is the "bouncer" (because apparently it is a club on Saturday morning for mimosas and brunch): he is about 50, wearing an ill-fitting suit jacket, and thinks he controls the portal to the holiest of holy brunches...I think not. We had to wait behind a a rope on the sidewalk before we could enter to order a sandwich...are you kidding me? They handed us a menu they had printed on computer paper off their website that had been used a thousand times before, and the ink was so light, i couldn't read any of their million sandwiches. The guy taking our order was so distracted by the @lime part of this whole fiasco we called lunch, we had to repeat our order at least 4 times, no joke. Then we had to wait on the street for our food, so we could take it elsewhere to eat, although the @lime was EMPTY... how that makes any sense, I will never understand. FOOD: I ordered the "Spiffy Tiffy" ($9.99) and it was anything but 'spiffy.' It was supposed to have: Halal Chicken Breast, Pesto, Mushrooms, Avocado, Pepper Jack and Provolone, however, that is NOT what I got. The chicken was dry and tasteless. There was NO pesto, NO avocado, and NO other veggies, save for handfuls of shredded lettuce (there is nothing worse for a sandwich than shredded lettuce!). There was some sort of rubber that fell out the back when I bit into it, I am assuming this was the "provolone" or "pepper jack"??? The entire thing was soggy and dripping with the "mushroom sauce" which neither tasted like mushrooms, nor contained a single mushroom. It was absolutely the most god-awful "sandwich" I have ever attempted to eat! Needless to say, I ate about 1/4 of it before I decided I was disgusting and I had to throw it out!A menu with literally 100s of choices should have tipped me off that the place either doesn't know what they are doing, or is trying to combat quality with quantity...With such poor 'service' and terrible sandwiches, I don't care to patronize this establishment again to give them a chance to redeem themselves.
Saw Ike's Place in an episode of Man vs. Food. I have been looking forward to the sandwiches ever since. Finally got my chance to eat here and was some what disappointed. The menu was extensive, over a hundred sandwiches to choose from and a great place for vegans as well. They have at least 20-30 sandwiches designed for vegans. I ordered the sesame street veggie sandwich and my husband got the Menage o Trois. According to the cashier, it is the best selling and most popular sandwich. If you only eat at Ike's one, you MUST order the Menage o Trois. Maybe we have too much expectations but the sandwiches were nothing special. We both had our sandwiches on Dutch Crunch and my husband hated it. The Menage o Trois tasted like any other BBQ chicken sandwich, even with the special house sauce they put on all sandwiches. It was good but it wasn't great. My veggie sandwich was good but since it was a veggie sandwich, I felt like it could be done without all the fat and grease from the sauce. The line and wait was long. It was good that a bag of chips was free with every sandwich purchase. While waiting, we started munching on the chips. But the chips also ruined our palate and appetite to enjoy the sandwiches. I may come back and order other sandwiches. The line is long for a reason, maybe we just didn't order the right sandwich this time.
Overall: Above averageService: Friendly but slowThe cashier was very friendly. While I was browsing the menu on the window of the store, she asked me if I had any questions. But she was somehow way too friendly that she talked to everyone in the queue. It took her well over 30 mins to take the orders from 10 customers! The total wait from lining up to getting the sandwiches was over 45 minutes on a Thursday afternoon.Food: GreatWe had the menage a trois sandwich (the popular sandwich). The dirty sauce was awesome. For some reasons, the halal chicken had the texture of tuna. The sandwich was good and filling.The food is great. We will return again some time, may be at some odd hours when the line is not as horrendous.
So good I had it all over my shirt!!!! The change was the bomb. My husband had the Tony Soprano it was good too:)
best sandwiches in the whole world! omg i love going to ikes! thank god i work down the street!
Maybe my expectations were just too high after reading thousands of glowing yelp reviews. I ordered a Matt Cain on Dutch Crunch.  The Dutch Crunch bread is pretty damn good. Overall, I'd say it was an excellent sandwich but factoring in the high price, long waits, and its pretty much take-out only status (for $10+ sandwiches, I'd really like a place to sit and enjoy it while its hot & fresh), I'm giving just a 3 star rating. I'd come back to maybe try a couple more of their sandwiches, but can't see myself becoming a regular at Ike's.
...Wait...Seriously?...I haven't reviewed IKE'S YET?!?! What the H-E- double hockey sticks is wrong me?These sandwiches are magic. I don't know what they do to it (make love to it? Okay, ew, never mind), but it is amazing. I love the shredded meat thing they do.My fave is the "Name of the Girl I'm Dating"-honey mustard, chicken and avocado. The fries, with their yummy chipotle-like, slightly carcinogenic flavor are some of the best fries around.Ike's is only 2 blocks from my apartment, but to get there I have to cross Market- and anything on the other side of Market seems worlds away sometimes. This is good, other wise I'd eat an Ike's sand which every day.I was going to dock Ike a star for their hours (WTF- its like people in SF don't have jobs), but now I see Ike's is extending their hours. Yippee!
I went back to Ike's in the early evening, and didn't even have to wait in line. I bought 3 different sandwiches (one for me, one for my girl and one for my bff), and I must say they were infinitely better than the last time we were here. Unfortunately, I can't say any of them were great (got to try all 3, since I paid). They were pretty good and perfectly edible, just not special in anyway. I felt like they were a little pricey for the quality, honestly. However, the gentleman who took my order was incredibly pleasant and helpful. I give the food 2 stars and the service 5 stars, so I gave it a 3 star rating. That seems fair, no?
Ike's sandwiches are legend!!! Don't let the line scare you...these sandwiches are more than worth the wait! Whatever your tastebuds are screaming for, you can find a saucey bit of Ike's heaven to satisfy them. The Backstabber is my personal favorite...I looooooove artichoke hearts, and the Dirty Sauce (duh) just blasts the flavor factor through the roof! Familiarize yourself with the menu, and call in your order to eliminate the wait. Then, all you'll have to look forward to is getting that face-melting sammy down your throat. Oh, and they do gluten free bread for all of you people out there with gastrointestinal issues. Peace, brothers and sisters.
There is no sandwich on earth better than the Dirty California Roll on Dutch Crunch. NONE. Sweet and tangy, with a little kick. Big chunks of crab meat and shrimp. Trying to eat it is a total mess, but worth every smear of dirty sauce on your face and the stack of napkins you'll need to clean up. And it should be said that in addition to having the best sandwiches on the planet, the staff is super nice and friendly (lots of cute hipster boys behind the counter!) and the complimentary lollipops are pretty frickin awesome too!
Besides having the greatest bridge in the world, I am now a firm believer that SF also has the greatest sandwich in the world - Ike's! One bite of this sandwich and all the sandwiches that you've ever had in your life (and most likely will be having, unless it's from Ike's Place) will seem inferior. You'll wish you've never wasted stomach space and calories on such garbage b/c that's what Ike's sandwiches make every other sandwich seem like in comparison. Absolute junk. Rotten sewage. [Name of the Girl I'm Dating], an instant fav, is not like any chicken sandwich you've ever had before. The chicken, first of all, is not a slab of dried up chicken breast slapped between two pieces of Costco bread. No, this sandwich (as with every other sandwich on this menu) has been carefully considered and thoughtfully crafted. This chicken is shredded in a way that allows for easy consumption and extra moist meat. I never thought about it until I had a chicken sandwich here, but this technique makes a huge difference in enjoyment. The bread (a variety to choose from) is warm and tasty. It's not a hardened rock of carbohydrates like many other sandwich places serve. No, this bread is the right amount of thickness, crunch, and holds everything in its place the way a sandwich should.Perfection. But you won't know what that is (at least in the form of a sandwich) until you've been to Ike's Place.
The sandwiches here are amazing...lots of flavor thanks to the dirty sauce and there is like a hundred different types of sandwiches to choose from. I'm not exaggerating. The wait was long ( about an hr ) but well worth it. We both got two sandwiches since this was the only time we'd be there. Total came out to be around $20. Came with 2 bags of chips and a handful of caramel apple lollipops.
He leans in slowly, hands me a tray with a tenderly wrapped sandwich, and in a way only he could gently asks, "Did you have the manage a trois?" Ike changed my life with those last three words. Chicken breast topped with three cheeses, three sauces, plus other goodies and an absolutely tasty dutch crunch. Got it extra spicy, like I do, and it was sublime.My dining partner got the veggie meatball, and I literally thought she was going to [insert inappropriate sexual remark] when she took her first bite. I also took a nibble and then understood why.Line is worth the wait. The staff inside are great and actually have a good attitude which is commendable seeing how hard they work to get through the endless line of patrons each waiting for their little piece of heaven.
Jumping on the bandwagon here-- my friend Bekah has been raving about this place. I'm NOT a fan of sandwiches. I think they're boring as hell, so I was hesitant to try Ike's. How good can a sandwich be, really?The answer is OMG SO EFFING GOOD. SERIOUSLY. I am totally impressed. I had the Eli Manning, and just... YUM. I can't say enough about how TASTY and GOOD it was. And their FRIES? To DIE for... I've never tasted fries quite like them. The seasoning is DELICIOUS.Oh also? I'm a mayonnaise HATER. HATE HATE HATE mayonnaise. But their dirty sauce? REALLY GOOD. As their website says-- even mayonnaise haters like the dirty sauce, so don't knock it until you try it.Bonus-- Ike and his staff are totally cute, sweet, and just plain awesome all around. :)
Tradition. When it comes to sandwiches, I'm all about traditional Italian or Jewish delis. Don't get me wrong, Ike's is good. But it's not "wow" or "OMG" or whatever. I gave the place three trys and on all the trys, I was only half impressed. On the third try, I was actually craving Italian cold cuts - a good Italian combo w/mortadella, coppa, prosciutto. Nah, not that kind of place. On the plus side, they are NOT skimpy on the goodies between their breads - which is also freshly baked (another plus - but then Subway does that too). Their "Dirty Sauce" is also a good add to the sammy, another great plus. There's a ton of hype on the place, and the friends that rave about this place are not "traditional" deli people like I am. As a matter of fact, some of them are vegetarians...and I hate to say it, they're limited on the palette side. Come on, you don't eat meat. You're limited. (Another big plus for Ike's is that they are veggie friendly). Personally, I'm against the killing of all plant life and having it on my sandwich makes me a bit uncomfortable. But I'll get through it.By the way, it's a tiny place, so take it "to go". Maybe one of these days, they'll move to a bigger place. Hey, how about adding an Italian Combo on the menu. (Come on guy, I know you're gonna read this).
Almost had a heart attack when I thought they had closed, when in reality they only moved locations(right across the street from their old one). I was so excited to try this place as I am a huge sandwich connesoiur and love coming up with unique combos. I ordered the menage au trois, with the dirty flavor chips. The combination of flavors was out of this world good and the dutch crunch bread was to die for. I wasn't sure how the chips were going to taste but they were completely addictive.
In the hall of fame of man's greatest inventions, sandwiches ought to be right up there with the wheel and fire. I friggin love sandwiches. You have your bread, piles of meat, your veggies, your cheese, and your choice of sauces. What's there not to love?After finally getting a chance to visit Ike's, I discovered that not all sandwiches are created equal. Not even close. I don't know if I should be happy I found a place that makes such delicious sandwiches, or if I should curse the gods for showing me just how good it could be and how everything else will now pale in comparison. But what I do know is that I couldn't stop smiling while I ate my sandwich because it was just so damn mmmm.I got the Nacho Boy (Hot Roast Beef, Mushrooms, Avocado, Swiss!! All my favs in one sandwich!!) and you know it's "just a sandwich," but the taste was anything but. I don't know what it was; the perfectly seasoned meat? the hint of mushrooms? The wonderfully chewy bread? It was just on a completely different level. Taking a recommendation from a friend (thanks P!) I got mine on a dutch crunch roll. To be honest, I've never really liked dutch crunch (but then again my dutch crunch experience has been limited to Safeway) but the bread I had today was AM-A-ZING. Slap me with a pair of clogs and call me a fan. Thanks to the friends I was with, I also got to try a bite of the M.I.L.F. (like buffalo wings, without being uncomfortably spicy or vinegar-y), which didn't have the jalapeno poppers cuz they were out but the sandwich still tasted pretty damn good, and the Change which got incredibly messy and sticky from the bbq sauce, but completely worth the trouble to eat it (tons of meat and a nice sweet smoky taste).I found that for each sandwich, none of the sauces and no one ingredient ever completely overwhelmed the taste. That allowed every part of the sandwich to pop and sing in glorious harmony with each bite. Extra props to the workers who were all super friendly. I think I'm going to need more excuses to come to this place.
Good sandwiches but not worth the long wait. If you want to go, go when there's not a line.
IN LOVE with the manage a trois on dutch crunch, but I can't say I know if it lives up to it's name. I overheard one of the owners claiming that this was the original sandwich discovered that ultimately started the business up. AMAZING.My sister and I were sitting, eating, trying to figure out what makes this sandwich so much better than the next. Freshest ingredients, the dirty sauce? What is dirty sauce anyways?Who cares! You must try this place. I know that you won't be disappointed. Have a lollipop to top it off and you've already had the perfect day by lunchtime!
Before Ike's: Sandwiches were two pieces of bread holding a chunk of meat together and throw in some green stuffs.After Ike's: Sandwiches are a God given gift for our palettes. Savor each bite as it tantalizes your taste buds. You cannot go wrong with Ike's. Get any sandwich and it will be good.
I thought my sandwich last time was pretty fantastic and would be hard pressed to find one even better - but oh wait, I did! I ordered the Pride of the Castro this time, which is turkey, ham, and brie, and it was even more amazing than my cheesesteak! I ordered it without ham, dirty sauce, or mayo, but the sandwich was sooooo delectable despite the changes! The hot melted brie on the sourdough combined with the fresh turkey slices was AMAZING!!!
Ike's Place definitely deserves the hype. I came here because of all you fellow Yelpers, who collectively gave Ike's Place 4.5 stars.I had the #14 Chipper's Fave (shrimp and imitation crab with American Cheese) and it was fabulous. The line was not very long and the service was courteous and cheerful. Only some of the sandwiches are listed on the board, so you may need to use the book like menu to over their long list of over 100 sandwiches or better yet, look them up on the Internet and begin drooling.The sandwich weighed a ton and really filled me up. I am usually a big eater, but this sandwich had everything, mayo, Dirty Sauce (their own creation), Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onions, Pickles, Banana Peppers. The sandwiches are messy, so cover yourself with napkins or wear grubby clothes. The caramel apple lollipop was a nice touch.There is really no outdoor seating, but I guess you can stand and eat your sandwich and watch the interesting people standing in line. Everybody eats at Ike'sI will definitely come here again and try another sandwich.
Delicious sandwiches.Too bad they don't taste good cold, as the magic of the sandwiches at Ike's is to eat them while they're hot. If you don't have a big appetite, share one with a good friend.If you can't finish an entire sandwich, it's a total bummer because it's almost pointless to try to reheat it due to the lettuce becoming wilted and soggy. Of course, you could opt out of all veggies in the sandwich, but what's the point if you did that?I'll work my way down their menu offering eventually. From what I've sampled so far (#2, 4, 5 - all with meat, of course ), they've been winners.Oh, and I'll have to remember to order the sandwiches in advance. The waiting in line bit sucks.
Seriously incredible. But you knew that.
This is the best sandwich place I've been to in SF. I ordered the MILF and was completely satisfied. My sandwich was huge and delicious. As much as I liked it, I was only able to finish half, so I suggest splitting a sandwich if you go with someone.When I got to Ike's there was quite a long line, but for the amount of people in line, they actually have very good turnaround, I spent about 15 min in line and then 10 min waiting for the sandwich after I had ordered. They also have vegan options available!This place is unlike any other sandwich place I've ever been to. They have completely transformed the concept of a sandwich, putting together unexpected ingredients to make a delicious meal. My MILF sandwich came with jalepeno poppers in it, YUM!If you are in the SF area, this is a definite must visit.
I have two questions: Is Ike single? Is Ike vegan?This is the best sandwich joint in the universe--the most vegan and vegetarian options I've ever seen. Call your order in ahead of time. Ike's has a web site now.Here's a tid bit about why the wait is sooooo damn long (but WORTH IT): Unlike most sandwich shops where the bread was baked earlier that morning, the bread your sandwich is made on isn't baked until after you order your sandwich. That means every sandwich is freshly baked to order.Marry me, Ike!
The sandwiches here are amazing!! I was in SF for my bday and needed to try Ike's before I came back to So Cal and I am so glad I did. My friends hyped this place up so much that I was scared I was going to be disappointed, but that wasn't the case. I already knew what I wanted from looking up the menu online (the Shawn Michael-philly cheese steak, fried mozzarella sticks, bacon, and some other stufff) it wasn't on the menu at Ike's but I was still able to order it. It was soo freaking good. Kinda glad I don't live in SF or else I'd be obese since I'm sure these sandwiches aren't that friendly to your health. I don't remember what other sandwiches my group got, but I remember them all being real good. Sooo many different types of sandwiches, definitely need to go back to try some more!PS. the wait can be kind of long because they are soo BUSY all the time, and not really a lot of seating area outside, but a friendly staff and great sandwiches more than makes up for these minor issues.
If it was easier to obtain these sandwiches on a weekend, I'd give this 5 stars. There are controlled substances that are easier to get.Just make sure you call ahead!
Ike's is amazing! Not only do they have an exceedingly good menu that's a mile long, including a full menu of creative veggie sandwiches, they offer a gluten free bread option (very tasty)! Call in and pick up is the way to go to avoid the line (these sandwiches are so good people actually wait in (long) lines to get get 'em!) and the subsequent wait. And the staff and/or owners are always friendly. I used to say there weren't any good delis in SF that I couldn't get enough of. Well, problem solved.
my love for samwiches....It's even good after 5 hours waiting for me at work... Thanks Em!
I adore this small sandwich shop! Whenever I'm in the area I have to stop by.The people here are soo friendly & nice. They always help me tackle in choosing my sandwich from the huge selection of unique sandwiches. To add to the confusion they also have a wide variety of different sodas and drinks. The "dirty sauce" is what makes their sandwiches sooo good! I've tried a lot of their sandwiches & they never disappointing. One of my favorites is the sandwich with the hot link!
yes, i'm going to be posting another cliche review...How good can a sandwhich be?well, at ikes its AMAZZZZZZINGGGGGGGGGG best sandwhich i've ever had in my life. i had the kryptonite. nuff said.
Good god this is an amazing sandwich shop.I have never had a chicken breast sandwich that wasnt completely dry and meh... until now.
Once again when we got here, there was a long line out of the door. I jumped out to go stand in line while Pauline and Allison went on their difficult search for the elusive creature that is a SF parking spot. The actual place itself was quite small and only had space for you to put in your order and then go wait outside (and what long wait it was, more on this later).Ike's Place is known for their extensive menu with over 100s of different types of hot sandwiches catering meatlovers all the way to vegans. Each sandwich was also given clever and witty names (Al Bundy, M.I.L.F., and Menage a Trois are some of my favs). With that, here's a tangent of some suggestions I have for new sandwiches and names to show off how clever and witty I am."Average American"-Ham, 3 cheeses, sandwich bread is replaced with bacon"Cal Student"-Organic free range Chicken, organic hand-picked local tomatoes, dirt"Berkeley Hobo"-anything left over (preferably half eaten)Moving on, although the line didn't seem that long, it still took about 20 minutes till we got to order. It wasn't until I got to the counter that I understood why ordering took so long. The cashier is actually Ike himself and he really took time getting your order, making sure he got everything that I ask for. Cheesy as it sounds, this really did make me feel special and not just like any other customer. While I was ordering, one of the workers was finishing off his shift, and before he left, he gave a hearty goodbye to the rest of the crew. It was a bromantic moment, but also underlines how Mom & Pop this place is. You won't get this type of camaraderie at Subway.So I ended up getting "Backstabber" (chicken, artichoke hearts, caesar dressing, provolone), A got "Nacho Boy" (roasted beef, mushroom, avocado, swiss), and P got "[Name of Girl I'm Dating]" (chicken, honey mustard, avocado, pepperjack).So the Pros: the sandwich was freaking bomb! So mouth-drooling delicious! The bread had the right amount of crunchy-chewy ratio! You could really taste their famous Dirty Sauce (garlic aioli with their secret herb and spices) which really brought the sandwich to another level. The hot sandwich also tasted so much better since we were sitting out in the cold SF night.The cons: for 8-9 dollars for a sandwich, it is slightly on the pricey side IMO (even if it is gourmet) especially since I grew up in the land of $2 Vietnamese sandwiches (which are equally delicious). And if I want to be Top-Chef-nitpicky, I thought my chicken was also kinda dry. But the biggest thing that I dislike was THE WAIT! It took 20 minutes just to order, but another 30 MINUTES for the sandwich. Reading the website, the reason behind the torturous wait is that they don't bake the bread till we order it. I guess I'm too impatient to wait 50 minutes total for a sandwich, which to me is the epitome of quick food. But with that said, the sandwich was still pretty damn good.
1. Read the menu on their website.2. Call in your order.3. Ask yourself why there are 50 assclowns waiting in line outside the place when you go to pick it up.4. Eat your sandwich away from the ravenous crowd.
Let's get one thing out of the way. I'm not a fan of sandwiches. Yes I know thats blasphemous but I know what I like and don't like and sandwiches just aren't one of those things I ever crave. That is, until I came here. They were absolutely delicious here. I don't know how you can make some meat stuffed in between bread so damn good. They may have converted me into a sandwich loving person.Delicious? Yes. Worth the hype? Ehhh, but the sandwiches were damn good and thats coming from someone who doesn't particularly care for them either.. And so creative too! And he went to my high school! How cool is that? Gives me some hope for the future. I'll be the first to buy into the franchise (if he ever starts one that is)
UMM...Note to self: Don't order the Superman and another sandwich for yourself only. Read on for further details.Gone are the long lines and now Ike's is at Lime. Since, at the moment, they're only taking phone orders, we called into Ike's and let me tell you, that was an accomplishment in itself. I felt like I was calling into a radio station for a chance at free concert tickets, the phone was just that busy; would go straight to voicemail. Okay, so finally we get someone on the line and we're put on hold for five minutes, someone takes our call and what do you know, the call starts breaking up! NOOO!!! *Click*Shit, we call again, going straight to voicemail again. F*ck f*ck f*ck...a couple minutes later, we get a call back, it's Ike's!!! Muwahahah, okay time to order.I was glancing at Yelp reviews and Celine L. thought the Superman was the best. Okay, I thought, I'll go with that, but I was feeling really hungry that morning so I decided to also get the Hollywood Cheesesteak. BAD IDEA. We picked up the sandwiches, cash only at the moment by the way, and headed over to Golden Gate Bridge Sitting down with the bees swarming me, I then realized the huge mistake I had made, the Superman was HUGE. It was two sandwiches in one. I guess that's why they call it Superman??? Yea, I"m an idiot, I know. At any rate, I scarfed down half of the Superman and half of the Hollywood Cheesesteak. And while the Superman was meaty and flavorful, I think I preferred the Hollywood Cheesesteak more. The combination of thinly sliced rib eye with mushrooms and provolone on dutch crunch (choice of dutch crunch, French bread, or wheat) was simply awesome. Nevertheless, I'm sure you can't go wrong with ANY of their sandwiches.Good luck with them concert tickets!
Swung by for lunch and the woman at the counter was very friendly. Got a couple sandwiches and split them with my girlfriend, they were awesome! Just get there before 12
Their sandwiches are the bomb, so so yummy. Every sandwich comes with a bag of chips, so that is a plus. Be prepared to wait as the lines are always insane. And there is no place to sit, but on a warm sunny day it is nice to walk two blocks to Dolores Park and enjoy your sandwich, nom nom!
What can I say about Ike's that hasn't been said before:I know!Ike's: I totally appreciate your gesture of giving the lollipop suckers away with sandwiches. Nice way to end a meal and sets you apart from the rest (as if you weren't already)HOWEVER, you seem to alternate between the Caramel Apple Pops and the standard Tootsie Roll Pops, and I think I speak for most here when I say the Caramel Apple Pops are soooo much better than the Tootsie Roll Pops. Like I got sooo happy when I first saw it and then was soo sad when I saw the gift degenerate back into the lowly Tootsie Roll pop.Thanks!
Ike's gets 5 stars despite the line that wraps around the corner and the price. Most sandwiches are less than $10 and it might sound expensive but its just plain worth it. As for the line, they can't help it. People like their sandwiches and I can't blame them. Just call in your order and pick up later in the day. The Dutch Crunch bread is amazing. The Dirty Sauce is what makes the sandwiches out of this world. There are about one million ingredients and a thousand different sandwiches most of which can be made regular or vegetarian. The Monte Chase-o, Manage a trios, and the Reuben are killer. I'm jealous of anyone who hasn't tried Ike's yet. The first bite is one of the moments that will flash before your eyes before you die.
Would you know crack's name,if you smoked it in heaven?It would feel the sameif you ate an Ike's sandwich that's vegan.Ike must be strong and carry on...cause his sandwiches are like crack from heaven...Edit: Even if they did have crack in heaven, smoking it would be less enjoyable than eating at Ike's. "O Sandwich Maker from Bob!" [Ralph] pronounced. He paused, furrowed his brow, and sighed as he closed his eyes in pious contemplation.If they served Ike's at the United Nations, we'd have world peace.Ike may be the antichrist, performing sandwich-based miracles of tastiness to win our eternal devotion.According to legend, "There shall be great want, and Antichrist shall go from land to land and give bread [DUTCH CRUNCH!?!] to the poor. And he shall find many followers. [ON YELP?!?]"
Approximately 35 min wait on a Saturday afternoon around 3 pm. Bring a DS or something and the time will pass quickly.Ordered the chicken marinara (Curtis) and ribeye w/ mozzarella sticks (SexyBoy). Both were crispy, warm, melty fistfuls of deliciousness. The Empire Ginger Ale is light and refreshing.The workers are friendly and appreciative. Before you even order, they thank you for the wait. I like supporting local businesses like this. Go at least once, just to see what all the fuss is.
I found Ike's to have delicious sandwiches and friendly staff. I also encountered extremely rude guests during my one and only visit to Ike's. It's like a bad server, you encounter them once, you dislike the thought of seeing them twice.I arrived with my lunch date on route to some volunteer work. We order two delicious sandwiches, my favorite kind of sun chips, French Onion, and two lemonades. I go outside to sit at one of there four outdoor tables when a girl with brown hair throws her bag down, as I am pulling out the chair and says, "sorry, too late."I think, I been in these situations before and usually I am fine with them. We all want to eat and she had clearly spotted the table first. No problems here at all. Then, ten minutes later, still no available tables, our food arrives. Girl with brown hairs eight friends arrive and then I realize, she hasn't even ordered, yet she's laughing and chatting as if she hasn't a care in the world. We stand for five more minutes, then most of her friends, including her get up to order. At this point, we could have been done eating. Girl with long hair, who was now holding the table was easily convinced to let us sit and eat. She said she would allow us to "hold" the table, watching there coats while they ordered.I was so insulted, but we needed to sit, so we could eat, and have the sandwich. A word of courtesy and etiquette, do not take a table unless you have ordered. Once you order, if it takes forever, that is fine with me. Because of this rude girl with brown hair, I have no desire to return to Ike's for a while. If you see a girl with short brown hair hanging out at Ike's without food, beware. Other than this incident, the food is delicious, the sandwiches are really two meals or meant to be shared and the staff is really friendly. Five, but minus one star to the rude girl and another star for her friends.
Absolutely Delicious!sampled: (vegan) Meatless Mike on french & (vegan) Backstabber on sourdough.Halal meats are offered & sandwiches can be made vegetarian or vegan to satisfy a variety of dietary concerns!Generous portions mean you can share or have a snack for later on!**notes: this place is small - LIMITED seating means you should think of it primarily as take-away fare. it is BUSY! just pack a little patience - we waited aprox. 10 min in line, then perhaps another 10 for food. also, bring CASH! none of these should be seen as deterrents, but rather simply part of a fun, tasty, food experience... & worth it!!
If I ever have a daughter, I will name her Spiffy Tiffy after my favorite Ike's sandwich. I got it delivered, so I can't attest to the venue... but it was amazing (and the website is cool!), which is all that matters in the end. Nothing else I might say could convey the savory nuances and harmonious flavor of this french-bread world wonder, so I'll leave it at that. I like Ike. I(ke) (l)ike Ike. Ikeikeike.(I just realized that Ike is my 200th review!!! Very appropriate. I'm glad they made it such a fulfilling experience so that I could celebrate this occasion with a well-deserved 5-star review.)
Had the Hollywood's SF Cheesesteak and the Menage A Trois. I had both on their famous dutch crunch bread which is very good. The Hollywood's rib eye meat was a bit dry and hard. The sandwich itself was good, but not amazing. However the Menage A Trois was so flavorful and delicious. I did not expect that for a chicken sandwich. I went on a Sunday afternoon and didn't have to wait in line at all, which is a major plus. Definitely will be back to try all their other sandwiches for sure.
Baller sandwiches! their homemade bread takes the cake. I wish there was seating there because it was awkward trying to find a place to sit and enjoy while my sandwich was still hot.
IKE'S... WHYY ARE YOU SO FAR FROM ME=[. It makes me sad that I can't visit often because they have one of the most delicious sandwiches I've ever had. I came here for the first time and the workers were soo nice. They elped guide my decision on what sandwich to get since there are SO many choices. I settled for the menage-a-trois (shredded chicken, honey mustard, bbq sauce, and gouda). I had to stop myself from eating all of it just so I could save half and relive how good the sandwich was later on in the day haha. But seriously, there is a reason why this place is so popular.
I was torn between a 4 and a 5. Because I could easily say"yay! I'm a fan" but my SO took one bite of his sandwich and said "this is the BEST sandwich I've had in SF". Which to me translates to "Woohoo! As good as it gets!"I've become paranoid by places that make you call in your order ahead of time. We went to a sandwich place in Oakland that clearly said that if you didn't know your answers to everything you shouldn't order yet. Talk about stress ordering!So I spent time reading and re-reading the menu before I ordered. Made sure I knew the answers to all the questions. I took a deep breath and called.After hearing the pickup time (50 minutes!) I said thank you, hung up and said "wow, what a nice guy". +1 for Ike.We showed up 5 minutes before our alloted time and strolled right in. Ike was super nice and asked someone else to ring up our order. He went through our order, packaged it, gave me change and said thanks.Then, as I was walking out the door I heard Ike say "thanks Margie". Nice. personable service. +another 1.We get home and I take a bite of my sandwich. It's good. They went light on the dirty sauce as I requested. It was a good meatball sandwich but it wasn't mind blowing. (it was as a sandwich but not as a meatball, if that makes sense). Anyway, my SO took a bite of his sandwich and his face lit up. He took a bite of my sandwich, said it was good but he was the best ever. (I tasted it. it was good). + more stars :)I'm bummed I forgot to order the fries. Woops.Would definitely go back. Would keep trying other sandwiches. so really good sandwiches and really really really great service.
This place is soooooooo good. Haven't had a sandwich that satisfying and good. Do yourself a favor and order the "Lincecum" which I did and you can't go wrong.
MIKE LIKES IKES What Mike doesn't like is calling in for a sandwich and waiting an hour and a half for it - or even worse standing in line for 40 minutes and waiting another 50 minutes for it. The vast array of sandwiches served here will satisfy even the most picky eaters. Everyone from the strictest vegetarian to most carnivorous meat eaters and even the gluten free. The employees are always happy and I love that you get a lollipop with each sandwich. I understand why the place is so popular - their sandwiches are delicious. But I will say that there have been many a time where the wait has been a deal breaker.
Was very excited to try Ike's for the first time only to get home with not EVEN close to what we ordered. Horribly disappointing !!!!!
My family and I heard of Ike's from Man vs Food so we decided to try it out. We had to wait half an hour and the cashier was super rude. The sandwiches were actually pretty legit. However, my brothers and I found so many hairs in it, we couldn't even finish it.
There's no way I could say anything about Ike's that a hundred reviewers haven't already. Delicious. Fan-freakin'-tastic for vegetarians. Points off for lack of seating, price, and wait times.
I was looking for some serious sandwiches, so I went to Ike's Place.I had Al Bundy on sourdough. My buddy got a milf. Layers of delicious meat, topped with good sauce, finished with some avacado and all wrapped up between some good crusty bread. Sounds like a recipe for yum.I was happy. He enjoyed his milf. All is good in the world.
I came here on a Thursday afternoon at around 2:30, and there was a bit of a wait. Nothing unbearable, of course. The girl that took my order was especially friendly and helpful. I tried the Forty, which is chicken fried steak and cheddar. Got mine on toasted sourdough and with their house-made aioli and added mozzarella sticks. After one bite, I was overwhelmed by so many of my favorite flavors. It was pure sandwich heaven, and I will make a trip to Ike's Place whenever I return to San Francisco. Did I mention that the sandwich came with a free bag of Dirty chips and inside the sandwich bag was a surprise: a caramel sour apple lollipop. The people at Ike's Place are a class act!
Manage-a-Trois! The most delicious sandwich I've had in a very, very long time! The only down side is that the line was really long.... but the sandwich was totally worth the wait!!I will definitely be back to try their other tasty sandwiches!!
It really smelled good...even from a block away. I was excited.Boy is it tiny in there! There's at least 6 decent looking guys (ladies, some of which are single...so i hear) behind the counter, workin away and not a lot of standing room in front of the cash register. But, since you order and go or order and eat outside (where they have a few tables set up), it's not a big deal.I ilke how their sandwiches are hot. Not all deli's serve hot sandwiches. so that's a plus. they also have burgers. I saw pictures of fries on Yelp but then didn't see them on the menu and forgot to ask about them...so i don't know if it was just today when they didn't have fries or maybe you just have to ask.I got the #9 (Name of the girl i'm dating)...it was tasty! Very messy and very juicy, but really tasty. I usually don't need to use all the napkins they give you, but i had to with this sandwich. and it was all good.So we ordered. Paid. and then went outside to wait for a table to open up. We sat down and then waited for our sandwiches. The same guy who takes your money will bring your sandwich out to you and then later on, ask how you like the sandwich. So this guy is multitasking... super busy, running around, doing the cash register stuff, but still able to make a few jokes and ask how you like your sandwich.I could only eat half the sandwich so i went inside to get a bag for the other half to take home...and the cash register guy (sorry dude, don't know your name...but you had brown hair) so generously offered to wrap it up for me. He even gave me extra napkins...cuz we joked about how juicy/messy the sandwich was.So, the people who work there, as mentioned before, are super friendly, helpful, good looking, and nice in the professional sandwich maker kinda way. Awesome.
First things first,I wanted to find a place so good that I HAD to make a yelp account and review the place with 5 stars.And this is the place that did it for me.Born and raised in San Francisco, this is one of my favorite spots to eat.Ikes Place.I love sandwiches.But this place takes the sandwich to a whole new level.The dirty sauce is so damn good.Any sandwich here is delicious.I have never been disappointed every time I stop by here and grab a sandwich.It takes a while to make your sandwich but hey,it is well worth the wait.Free chips also?Hell yea.Too bad they took out the happy hour):Drinks are pricey but I can never help myself to buy one.The customer service here is wonderful.Everyone that works there is so easygoing.My uncle,aunt,and I had a wonderful talk with Nacho Boy.One of the nicest people I met.I love this place and I will always be a huge fan of their sanwiches.I am glad to be a San Franciscan.
Like this review is actually necessary, it seems like everyone knows already that Ike's is magic.After seeing Ike's Place on the Food Network show "Man Versus Food", it was a must stop on vacation to SF from Virginia. Ended up going twice it was so good. Line was ~5 people long on a Thursday at lunchtime and about the same Friday at the same time, although it was raining lightly Friday.I had two sandwiches, the Get Over It and Name of Girl I'm Dating, both on Sourdough. Amazing. Words do not describe how good these sandwiches are. Very sad to have left the city. They need to mail order the dirty sauce and other Ike's unique ingredients, I would signup in a heartbeat.Staff is excellent as well, very happy all the time, you can tell they enjoy their jobs. Altogether very fun place to go.
Kryptoniteeeeeeeee. Om nom nom* afreakenmazinggggg*
Honestly, there is no reason for me to review Ike's. if 1000 some reviews for a total of 4.5 stars can't convince you, then there's no reason why my review will.Mills' Vikings and Sexy Boy, dutch crunch bread, dripping and oozing with pesto and other goodness stuffed into that sandwich = WIN!Super hole in the wall, and the artwork is entertaining. On a Sunday morning at 10:30-11:00, NO WAIT IN LINE! Be smart people, don't expect to not wait if you come in at lunch hour.LOVE IT. If it's your first time comin here, pick out your sandwich from the online menu first because there are literally 70+ different ones. Maybe even 100.
By far the best sandwiches EVER!!! End of discussion. The sauce is amazing. If you have enough room, try the doomsday or kryptonite.
Great sandwiches, will come back again. Wished they has tables or more chairs for those waiting or eat there. Great if you just picking up to go. But all in all great and Yummy.
possibly the best meal i've ever had in my 19 years of livingi'm visiting SF from LA and MAN. i'm praying they expand to Los Angeles because these little shits are a gift from GOD.
A great experience wither online, calling ahead or walking in.. Everyone is upbeat and the sandwiches are absolutely amazing..
I know I'm a padre fan, but I lovvvve the Lincecum! Endure the line, it's worth it.
I'm too lazy at the moment to try and come up with something detailed and clever. Therefore short and sweet will be my style for this review:1) I am Vegan2) Most vegan sandwiches are pretty bland and lack proper flavor pizzazz 3) Ike makes the best vegan sandwiches I've EVER had4) And even though it can take up to a half hour to get your sandwich, and it may be a little pricey for said sandwich (8-9 buck$ is a little high), Daaaayymn are they F'ing good! Thus I must give 5 stars.Seriously never had a vegan sandwich that tasted so yummy. Even the vegan cheese -which c'mon fellow vegans, usually sucks- is melted and uber delicious. The Vegan Tony Soprano is my favorite thus far.  My mouth coats with saliva just thinking about one...
not much to say other than, GREAT SANDWICHES, FAST FRIENDLY SERVICE, U JUST GOTTA GO! and have a sandwich, loved the hot mama huda!!!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO . salivating. ok bye
Awesome! My roommates and I came to Ikes on our road trip to Seattle. We came here because of Man V. Food. The places certainty lives up to its reputation. We go lost looking for the shop as we are from LA, I called up and they were glad to walk me step to step there. Once we arrived they were glad to serve us with a smile on their face. I wish I didn't live so far or else I would be there all the time. I heard they will be opening one in the South Bay, I am sooo excited!
Of course the sandwiches are amazing, that's a given. I was inspired to give Ike's Place a 5 star review for how amazingly kind and helpful their entire staff ALWAYS seems to be, whether on the phone, or in person. Thanks to the wonderful employees of Ike's Place!
OMG... this is one of the tastiest sandwiches I have ever eaten. I got this paradise sandwich... forgot the name. But it's marinara and pineapple... omg they make such a delicious pairing. MmmMMmmmM!Oh, and doesn't break the bank. How wonderful!And the sammys are so big you can save the other half for dinner! I think this place holds the sammich stand in my heart.
Its was our 1st time in SFO, we got lost & were tired & frustrated. We (wife & 2 daughters) were all bickering. Then we found Ikes. Not impressed with lack of seating. We ordered, then all bite into our sandwiches at the same time. We simultaneously experienced euphoria! WOW, hands down the best sandwiches we ever had! And we are from NY!
So many option, and they're all amazing. Plus who doesn't love the dirty sauce?
Great sandwiches, great staff, Ikes is always a stop when heading to the SF area.
very good
Being a vegetarian with vegan tendencies, going to a deli or sandwich shop normally gives me three boring options: cheese sandwich, hummus sandwich, or PB&J. But not at Ike's! I love Ike's because of the amazingly insane variety of bread types, toppings (veggie meats! and OMG: the veggie Pilgrim), that dang tasty dirty sauce, and the laidback and friendly staff who work the counter. Too bad this place isn't much of a secret anymore. But hey, go early and go often.
Best sandwhich I've ever had. I always make it a point to stop here when I'm working in or passing through San Fran. The line may be long, but trust me - it's worth it. I have ordered a different sandwhich each time and I am never disappointed.
I've had sandwichs before but NOTHING compared to the sandwichs from Ike's. I can't even pick which one to tell you about because they are all sooooooooo good. Everything about the sandwiches are delicious! It makes you full for daaaaaaaaaaaaaaays. Everytime I make a trip to the city, this place is a MUST. Ike is sooo friendly and if he's there, he never fails to make small talk with you!
Is this the line for the new iPhone? Nope, it's just a sandwhich place.I don't get places like this. With the amount of business they do, why haven't they invested back into the business and make the experience a LITTLE more tolerable. Bring a lawn chair, a cooler of beer and your own table because it will be a long wait - and once you finally get it there is nowhere to eat it.
I'm going to be 3205th review that will say one word: YUMMY!
This place is awesome. The Good - portions are awesome. I had the Kryptonite which is basically 2 12" sandwiches. The 20.00 ones are 2 sandwiches packed. And it is ever tasty. I am eager to try some of the other innovative sandwiches. This place has a huge variety of sandwiches to try for the meat, veggie and vegan in you. It is worth the wait in line and worth the money. They give you chips with the sandwichThe bad - the line - as long as you are patient and know going in that yes, you will stand outside for at least 10 minutes or so, but its such a fun environment so who cares and again it will be worth it The place due to the lines and mass amount of people is a little bit small. If I had to criticize anything at all - its there arent tables/chairs to eat. There are chairs to kick back on, while people wait for their name to be called or eating. During the wait, people can easily get in each others way. And while you wait in line there is a bathroom. I think it was a weird place to have a toilet. I mean if someone opens the bathroom door while you are there, you get a wonderful view of a toilet. Hopefully someone wont be sitting there when that door opens.Seriously its very minor (at least to me) - its the food that makes this place, the portions, the creativity , and the flavors. If you can eat the Kryptonite, you will experience a different taste in each bite because there are so many ingredients in it - and since I thoroughly enjoyed it, I am sure that other items on the menu are also going to be just as good.In closing, the people are friendly as well :)
Second visit: I ordered the MILF. The cute chick behind the cash wrap chuckled. That's okay, it was worth it. After eating "buffalo chicken" sandwiches again and again and again during my years in Pittsburgh, I thought I'd tried them all.Ike's changed my entire worldview, again. I don't know how they do it, but they manage to take something you thought you knew and make it twice as good. Amazing.
Yummmmy. I went to Ike's Place yesterday and was pleasantly surprised even after reading all the positive yelp reviews! I don't know what I was expecting, but the guys that were working were so nice and helpful and recommended good vegan sandwiches for us. My boyfriend got the vegan Backstabber and I got the Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian (but made vegan) and we traded half of each...Just listen to the 775 people that gave this place good reviews and go get a sandwich.
AMAZING. I want to subtract a star for the crazy wait and the steep prices, but it really is THAT good. It deserves all five stars! yum!
Greasy fingers and a full, full belly. What a treat this sandwich joint is!I've never been disappointed with the food I walk away from Ike's with- and they have an incredible amount of really tasty mock meats. I'd even go so far as to say they're crave-worthy.My only complaint- there really is nowhere to sit down with your food. You best be prepared to seat yourself on the sidewalk or take off with your "to-go" order.
I guess I lucked out with being the only one in line for one of Ike's delicious sandwiches! We're Just Friends- halal chicken(always top quality), avocado, jack cheese, banana peppers and topped with their secret sauce. My one mistake was taking my sandwich all the way back to San Rafael to eat it. It was a little too soggy. But even soggy my sandwich was fantastic! Freaking delicious! I will most def be back!
What more can I say about ikes that everyone has already said? Their sandwiches are the best it gets. I feel very high class when i eat there because their sandwiches are fit for a king. haha I got a CHANGE and it freaking changed my day! it made me all happy like how my girlfriend makes me not saying that it could replace her or anything.Another one i got was Menage a Trois which was OFF THE HOOD MAN! i would really recommend this sandwich to anyone who likes sweet and sour stuff ;] I'm planning to come here at least once a month.
Hands down, THE BEST sandwiches in the country! There are no words. Ike's sandwiches are an experience. So if you haven't had one yet, you need to plan a vacation around it! Go for a Spiffy Tiffy or a Jim Rome ;)
My brother saw this place on the food network and we were very excited to give it a try. We had a big group with different allergies and dietary requirements. This was a place that pleased everyone. The service was also amazing. One of the registers was down. The line wasn't even that long but they gave everyone a free drink! So many choices, definitely give it a try!
I had a few sandwiches here and they were all okay, too oily, greasy, and FAT. The flavor is not worth the heart attack.The service is nice =)
I came here on a Thursday night at about 7:15pm and there was a line of about 10 people in front of us. It took us about 15 minutes to get to the cashier and another 25 minutes waiting outside for our sandwiches. Yeah their sandwiches are pretty good (at least the ones we got, which were the Hella Fat Bastard and Menage de trois) but I don't know about waiting that long for a sandwich. There are plenty of other places to get a sandwich that tastes just as good or even better. I think it's the 'dirty' sauce that made the sandwich better. We missed the happy hour by 15 minutes which gets you free soda and chips. People who called in their orders walked in and walked out while those who didn't place a phone order waited outside. I guess this place is worth trying one of the 32543645 different types of combinations they have. I would think it's a good neighborhood/local sandwich joint, but if you're trekking from outside of the city, I'm sure your local deli is just as good...just add some jalapeno poppers or mozzarella sticks and you're good to go.I'd give the overall experience 3 stars, but the staff looked like they enjoyed what they were doing and were all smiles and I appreciate great customer service.
Heard about this place for a while now and I finally got to check it out. Decided to grab a sammich before the Glasvegas show. Luckily it wasn't that crowded since I hear it get's pretty packed. There's nowhere to sit inside since it's just a counter but they got some tables set-up outside where you can enjoy the scenery of Sanchez Street. I tried The Pizzle, which is turkey breast with lettuce, tomato, and bacon with ranch sauce. Sofa king good! You get to choose what bread you want, I had it on dutch crunch and it wasn't too violent on the roof of my mouth coz it was nice and heated up. Since it was a bit cold and windy, there wasn't that many people but folks came and went so you know it's crackin'. I can only imagine a warm, sunny day and the line is mad long. It's that good! If you like sammiches like my homegirl le v., you will love this joint! Garonteeed!GO NOW!
My aunt has been telling my family about this place for at least 3 months, and we've never seemed to try it out probably because it's such a trek during lunch hour from the Richmond to the Castro. Alas, Man v. Food...You really have to be ready to throw down mad dough and clog a couple arteries (for some menu choices), but I think that's the beauty of these unique sandwiches. I'd say Ike's is more of an indulgent lunch/late night deli. The sandwiches were pretty damned heavy and large, but once you squeeze down and take a few bites everything melts into a (thinner) mash of tasty deliciousness. I had to take a break after eating a few bites. I had the SF Giants w/ Mozzarella sticks, sub swiss for cheddar (I had to try the cheese sticks... wtf or ftw, i can't decide). Delicious but just almost OVERLY decadent. We went on a Monday around 3:48pm. Before ordering the cashier chick suggested to us to wait the 12 minutes until happy hour so we could get free chips and a drink (only on the right side of the fridge). We did, and it was a good idea. You really need a gallon of water or something refreshing.Definitely know what you're gonna order and do your research. The menu online is 100x more descriptive and helpful than the small one in-store. There are endless possibilities at Ike's. Call ahead or go close to closing time. All-in-all a good experience, definitely couldn't go too often. I just wish that there weren't rotting avocado peels by the window. They really should look into expansion as well.Oh if you're waiting in line for a long time in front of a popular deli in the Castro district of San Francisco, yes you will encounter a wide diversity of people including filipinos decked out in LV, older couples, truck drivers, moms and pops, preppy teens.. and yes maybe they'll all be wearing New Balances.. but stop judging and just love this beautiful city and all its beautiful people.Maybe it was me and MY boyfriend with the LV purse....
So, I didn't think I'd ever give this title to anyone, but Ike's is the best sandwich in the world. And I don't need to eat every sandwich in the world to know it. I want it. now. I love how Ike personally delivers each sandwich. The veggie napoleon is my fav. Amazing vegetarian options here.Update: I don't know if I should point this out but if you want to skip the line, call and order in advance. When you go to pick up, you can skip to the front of the line!
So it has been almost 2+ years since I have visited Ike's place when it was above Sanchez and super crammed. I loved their Menage a Trois back then and was excited to grab that sandwich again today. But I was quite dissappointed.Consider that It now costs almost 12 bucks, their filling didn't seem to be satisfying anymore. Cheese is less, and chicken is not covered in as much sauce, the whole sandwich tasted dryer. Bring back the quality, mang.
100% get the hype now! Everything I've tried here has been outrageously good. Sandwiches are big enough to share (plus you get chips!)- but once you bite into one, I doubt you'll want to!
I know everyone raves about Ike's, and their sandwiches are yummy. But they are way overpriced. I'm vegetarian and got a sandwich with avocado, swiss, mushrooms, and the complimentary toppings, on dutch crunch. It was $9.71. I mean it was good, not not amazing, and I do think the Whole Foods' deli made-to-order sandwiches are fresher, of better value, and healthier.
Ok if there is ever a place where the phrase "Hole in the Wall" were applicable, this would be the place. Not only is it like 5 feet carved into the side of a building, it is hot as hell once you step inside. I lean back on the drink display when there is a line (ergo, 1 person in between me and the cash register) because I want to absorb the coldness of the case. The sandwiches here are fantastic. The service is always friendly and they are always so cute. Seriously, if I worked here under these conditions, there are like 6 people at one time in 2 feet of space, and they are almost all very good looking, extremely pleasant and never soaked in sweat. I keep eating here because I imagine the antidote is in the food.Some of their orders have cutesy names. The eggplant sandwich I order has some name I never use and when I call in, which you can do by the way, and they repeat it to me time and time again. I wish I could just say eggplant parm on wheat with fresh tomato & pesto but they always rename it something silly. Whatever.The food is awesome and extremely affordable.
Tasty, toasted subs. Unclear if this one is related to the one in SF Mission, but I'm liking what I'm tasting.
I wanted to see what the hype was all about at this place. Honestly, I'm not impressed. It was not worth the wait, and my wait was an hour in the sun. Which, by the way, why the hell is it friggin hot in San Francisco??!  I had the kryptonite, because I heard it was the best of the best. It doesn't help that the guy at the counter tries to sell this sandwich to every customer that walks up. Let me give you guys advice: if you want repeat customers, suggest something that someone could finish and enjoy instead of making someone pay for the most expensive sandwich!To be honest, I started this review months ago, and I haven't finished this until now. Since then, I have gone to Darby Dan's in South City countless amount of times because of the great portions and jalapeno spread.  Thanks for your time!
New York delis have nothing on this place. Every time I go I pick up 2 or 3 different sandwiches and eat essentially nothing else for the next two days.... is that bad?Let them recommend the bread for each 'wich. They'll steer you in the right direction with sourdough for one that is saucier and french for one that isn't. The consistency will be perfection.Oh, and one more thing: Go dirty (sauce) or go home.
BUSYYYYYYYYYYY....all the hype from yelp and Man vs. Food has made this a popular place. Get ready to stand in line and then a while outside as you wait til your order is called.But Well worth it. Sandwiches were huge and very filling. I had the Super Mario - meatballs, marinara sauce and mozzarella sticks! Their menu is extensive and i had a hard time choosing my sando but more the reason to come back and try another! No place to eat outside but Dolores park is only a few blocks away!overall: 4 stars, VERY ORIGINAL!
This is a great effing sandwich.I have been meaning to try Ike's for a while (since it was Hot on Yelp many moons ago), but I was a bit deterred by the wait and by it's distance from where I'm normally eating (around the office!).When there was buzz in the office about potentially going to Ike's for lunch, I was not going to miss it. We ordered our sandwiches in advance - we called our orders in around 11:45 and planned to leave the office around 12 noon (hoping to arrive around 12:15). I studied the menu for an hour before deciding what I was going to get - I was torn between the Ex-Boyfriend (salami AND bacon???), the Montana to Rice (meatball sammie!) or the Forty (chicken fried steak). Um, yeah, I went with the chicken fried steak. We got a little delayed, and arrived at Ike's around 12:20/12:25. About half of our sandwiches were done, but luckily, we were able to find seats out front while we waited for our sandwiches. We'd initially thought about bringing our sandwiches back to the office but quickly realized that it would be a mistake as our hot sandwiches would be a hot mess by the time we had a chance to eat them.Chicken fried steak. When I tell people that's what I had for lunch, they are immediately grossed out, thinking that I've had this greasy, Denny's-like chicken fried steak. No, this chicken fried steak was on the thinner side, tasty, crispy and not the slightest bit greasy. The sandwich just looked so pretty and perfect, with the shredded lettuce, just the right amount of BBQ sauce (don't want it all dripping out!), tomatoes...and all of the fixings. Each bite was deliciously tasty with the right distribution items across in each bite. I don't remember pickles being included on the items in my sandwich, and I hate pickles. So when I found a pickle in my sandwich, I was concerned...but I kept on eating. And it was a delicious balance to all of the other flavors in my sandwich. Trust in Ike; he will not lead you astray. While my sandwich wasn't too heavy or gigantic, I was stuffed after one half. Did I stop? Nah.Ike and the folks who work there are so, so nice and super friendly. The variety of the types of sandwiches (plus the fun names) are so unique and different.The best damn sandwich I think I've had. Ever? Maybe ever. I just can't wait to go back and try one of the other sandwiches... I might even try a vegan sandwich. Ike's isn't close to where I live or where I work, but I will be back at Ike's.Oh, yeah, and the high fives really are free! **Full disclosure: Ike's is a Yelp advertiser, and I went to Ike's with Ike's account manager.**
One of the best sandwich places I've ever been to (Roxie's is still the best)! The cold cuts are juicy and the overall taste is mouthwatering! I also love places that are gluten-free friendly! The fact I can get jalapeno poppers in my sandwich is a huge plus!
I know there are a gazillion reviews for this place already but I just had to add my little snipet to reaffirm this. I was no freaking excited to try this place out. On the day I arrived the weather was perfect too meaning the most excellent sandwich eating experience was about to happen.I've heard of insanely good sandwiches at Ikes but ramen on a sandwich? No wayyy, but at Ikes, YES way. As my gf went to order the cheese steak, it was brought to our attention that they offered something called a Shanghai Cheese steak which included crushed ramen and a ginger sesame sauce. It sounded ultra weird but after being reassured that it was mighty tasty we decided to give it a try. What an awesome sandwich!!!! The contrasts between the warm deliciousness and slightly crunchy ramen was insane. Apparently one of the workers invented this weird marriage between cheese steak and ramen but wow was it good. He must've been REAL hungry one day to invent something like this.  Either way I'm glad it's available for us to try now.
Omg...talk about hearty lunches! Every single sandwich from here is brimming with all sorts of crazy fillings, and served with their mayo-on-crack Dirty Sauce. My turkey, bacon and brie was a bit salty, but that was totally forgivable because the sandwich overall was so tasty. Chicken breast, honey mustard and avocado was a bit more subtle in flavor and tasted great with the house-made pesto. If you really want to do a sandwich, though, get the Say Hey with a pastrami and bacon. The sandwich was invented for creations like this one!
Om nom nom. Best sandwich in the city. Longest wait in the city. Plan your meal three hours in advance and call ahead.UPDATE: Went to their new spot in Lime and had a very disappointing sandwich that was hardly toasted. Very sad. But that'll happen. One bad sandwich out of 1,000 is not a bad record...
The best sandwich I have ever had in my entire life! Believe the hype, it is ALL true!!!!! :)
This place is hands down one of the greatest sandwiches I have ever had!!!!!Even better than the sandwiches, the owner, Ike is really friendly and respectful. He still comes out and greets people and takes the time to hand deliver the sandwiches to them. This kind of stuff goes a long way in my books. By far my favorite sandwich is the MENAGE A TROIS. This is the one that got me hooked on the place and makes me coming back every time. Equally as delicious however are: The Paul Ruben The Jaymee Sirewich   The Matt Cain  Al Bundy   The Love Triangle. The best way to get them (in my opinion) is "Ike's way" and my favorite of all the breads is the Dutch crunch. Thank you Ike and all of your team members for making every experience to SF better than the one before it!!
totally awesome. I love the small business, sole proprietor, "apostrophe-s" business and Ike's is no exception. You want an awesome, creative sandwich? Go here.Not the place to go if you're in a hurry, they bake the bread after you order it for one thing. It's worth the wait. interesting: they don't have their full menu posted, there's more sandwiches listed online than in the store. So bring a printout, or a blackberry if you want to peruse the whole thing.
love the way the sandwiches smell,any juicy low calorie vegan sandwiches coming soon?
Absolutely delicious! Got the Super Mario on Dutch Crunch and I was completely blown away. Only problem is its so expensive! I am a college student (i.e. super broke) and i shelled out $13 for this sandwich. So this place can not become a regular occurence for me which is such a bummer because I already want another one. And unless I want to eat the more veggie and vegan options on the menu, most of the sandwiches fall above the $10 range.
Ike's has East-Coast-college-town-style hoagies right here in SF. I go there too often.Funny conversation from last weekend at the shoppe:Me: I'm here to pick up my Tony SopranoNacho Boy*: Oh, good choice. What else have you had?Me: I got the Hot Momma Huda last week. It was awesomeNacho Boy: Oh, we have a new one. Have you tried the Milf?Me: Well, not the sandwich ... :)*Laughter*In any case, they have awesome sandwiches with awesome names. All of the hoagies are fun with a unique flavor.My favorite so far is the Pride of the Castro.*Nacho Boy = Nickname of one of the chef's
Oh God. Ike's. My one and only.I think I should establish a few things first: 1) I am definitely not a hipster. I am not very hip at all. 2) I do like a lot of sauce. 3) I do not live in San Francisco. In the summer, I live in the East Bay. The rest of the time, I live in New York at school.The first time my best friend went to eat here, she and her boyfriend, who is the pickiest eater I have ever met, waited in line for close to two hours. Believing in Ike's goodness, they waited. Were they glad? Certainly. Both my friend and her boyfriend assured me that they are the best sandwiches they have ever had.The most recent trip I made to Ike's was with my mother, who is reluctant to try new things. I picked a Jim Rome for her and even got her to eat some of my Meatless Mike. After gushing her praises while she ate the sandwich, a behavior which is very unlike her, she said, "This isn't just a sandwich. It's an experience."These things being said, I must tell you that the only thing I miss more than Ike's Place while I am in New York is my cat. I am obsessed with my cat.
My first visit and review of Ike's was way back in 2008, and I've been a die hard, dedicated fan ever since. For the sake of all who are running for Mayor in 2011, Ike better not throw his hat in the ring and campaign on his skill with sandwich making, marketing, charming, being a marvelous and charming man. And he's got his Mom, so we're talking formidable without even trying his amazing food. I hadn't seen Ike in more than a year and a half when I walked in today after reading about the move almost across 16th from his humble beginnings. I walked in the front door of the larger, more improved Ike's and Ike called me out by name and asked if I was looking to try his burger I first went in search of back in 2008. I felt like a long lost friend and part of the close knit, loyal, discerning and huge crowd that gladly follows this icon where he takes a loaf of bread and some great fixings. Today I said no to the burger, but will be back within a few days for that sumptuous reward that I've missed a long time. The only comparable burger in town I will mention is the Tuesday ONLY offering at Rosamunde Sausage Grill on Haight which people line up for as much as an hour before they open every week. Ike is a stickler for perfection so expect the highest quality of ingredients and tons of equality in staff, menu item names, his passion and compassion along with his very handsome and hot looks.Back to the ingredients; I had a foot long turkey, havarti, avocado, tomato, lettuce, pickle, onion on a sourdough roll, all made extra memorable by a generous portion of Ike's mouth watering secret sauce which I wish he would bottle and sell. The new store has a big, catering kitchen that easily handles the heavy volume of large catered orders that pour into his place daily and used to make the wait so long. I actually timed my order from placing it to having it brought out to me and it was less than 7 minutes which is great for a fantastic custom made super sandwich. With your sandwich you get a bag of great kettle type chips and a lollipop in your bag, such a sweet touch. Ike told me a television reality show is being filmed as a pilot so that's another cool reason to get over there. Ike is the nicest, neatest, most natural and genuine man I've ever known in the cut throat competitive restaurant business, a true gentleman. I asked how his personal life was going, and he said "my personal life is my restaurant and my Mom" and that's one hell of a statement from a man who is on the front line of his business every day greeting, delivering, helping and being a person you want to go have a long, leisurely dinner with. I LOVE Ike and Ike's Place, bet you will too!
It's all been said about the greatness of the sandwiches. They are amazing.I have to say though, the waits are a joke. We just called in an order for our office at 11am and it won't be ready until 2pm. Seriously? 3 hours for 6 sandwiches. Honestly Ike is lucky we are completely addicted, because clearly any sane person would not wait 3 hours plus travel time for food.Ike, I do production consulting, let me know, really.One star off for phone hold time and wait for sandwiches. Food is 5 Stars for sure!
You must visit Ike's at least once! I read that the lines were long, but we must have lucked out because there were only a few people in front of us. There are only a few tables out front, but we were patient and secured one eventually. I do not remember which sandwiches we got, but they were the some of the best sandwiches ever. The bread was perfectly toasted, the veggies were fresh and crunchy, and the sauce brought everything together. I loved how it soaked into the bread. I am getting hungry just thinking about Ike's.The staff was so nice! They patiently talked us through the menu and made suggestions when I was my usual indecisive self. I want to go back right now!
Went there today, after seeing ike on TV, I said "hey I know that little guy" he was a bartender at a restaurant I cheffed at in Palo alto. I thought I give it a try. Sandwich was good but I think very overpriced for the amount of meat they give. It's half the portion of a togos sandwich. I Also didn't like how they charge you 13 dollars for a sandwich and tell you the chips are free. Big gimic not a fan of that. But I do have to say he's done great with his Web presence targeting the young hipsters. Congrats on making a successful business.
A.....MAZING!!!!! Yesterday my friends and I went to Ike's and I had a "Sometimes I'm a vegetarian" with avocado and extra cheese. Honestly it was an amazing sandwich. I mean it was so good. I will absolutely go here over and over again. This is now one of my new favorite places in the city I love and live in.
SUPERMAN SANDWICH!! HELLA YEAH! But just be prepared to wait.
Made a visit to the Asian Art Museum to view the Lords of the Samurai and was hungry for noodles or sandwiches and the sandwiches won out.So, we went to check Ike's & was concern that I heard the line would be long and they take some time to make each one.It took me a few minutes to find parking in that area (not easy) however to my surprise that the line was only a few people long but the choices were GINORMOUS.While waiting in line, there were too many great sounding sandwiches which I couldn't make up my mind until the very last moment. The order taker suggested a new one - The "Matt Cain" which had Roast Beef, salami & "godfather" sauce which tasty.There is no room to sit down & enjoy the sandwich so we took it to go.The sandwich was a bit pricey - hovering around $8+, I would probably go broke if I ate there every week so every few months would be just right.Maybe try the "Superman" or "Nacho Boy" next time.
Wow! Ike is a genius. This is like the perfect San Francisco sandwich shoppe. My vegan meatball sandwich was shockingly good. All of the elements from the scarily meat-like meatballs, the fresh hot bread, the fresh plentiful lettuce, the creamy spread -- were all glorious. The price was totally right. The place is fun, independent, exciting. There are almost (never) too many choices of toppings, meats, breads - it will make your head spin.
The sandwiches here are delicious!!!!! Came here recently with Jenny K. since I had never been before. It was about 5:30pm and when we drove by while looking for parking, there was quite a line. We found parking across the street and promptly walked over. Yeah, the place is tiny, but the moment you get near the door, you are consumed in nothing but happiness! I have never seen EVERY worker anywhere as happy and friendly as this place! Definitely a plus. We proceeded to order. I got the Backstabber ( Halal Chicken Breast, Marinated Artichoke Hearts, Caesar Dressing, Provolone) and Jenny K got the Nacho Boy Supreme (Roast Beef, Bacon, Mushrooms, Avocado, Havarti) with some substitutions. The cashier informed us that it was happy hour (I believe it runs from 5-7pm? sorry! I could be wrong) so along with our sandwiches we also got a drink and a bag of chips! Sweet! We went outside and sat at a table and waited for our sandwiches (There are about 5 tables outside). One of the workers brought out our sandwiches and asked if there was anything else he could help us with. We each got a caramel apple lollipop that came with our sandwiches!!! That was awesome because it totally reminded me of middle school. Anyway, the sandwich was...... absolutely.... DELICIOUS!!! It was nice and warm and just... perfect!! I can't believe I did not know about this place! I will definitely be coming back regardless of happy hour!
4.75 this place cant get 5 stars in my book due to the waiting time regardless if you call in and if even then sometimes they dont pick up -_-So I tried calling them 3x during my lunch break to no avail so I ended up just taking the muni to the castro station after work and walked 2 blocks to this place. When I arrived on a chilly sf afternoon around 6pm the day after they announced they would remain open on a technicality, there was still about 20 people ahead of me. Since I was there I decided to wait hoping I would get my sandwich in time to use my transfer. Luckily I only waited for 30 mins.Anyways, I got the superman for $17 after tax. Its basically one 16 inch sandwich cut into 2 regular 8 inch sandwiches. The superman contains 7 meats: Roast Beef, Corned Beef, Pastrami, Salami, Turkey, Bacon, and Ham and also included Avocado and Jack. After my first bite, I knew what made their sandwiches really good, its their secret dirty garlic sauce! Too bad they ran out of my favorite bread dutch crunch, which would have made my sandwich even more enjoyable. They also gave me some kettle chips and a caramel apple lollipop yea i know kinda random. They also have a vegetarian and vegan menu.Bottomline: If you dont mind waiting maybe even hours for one of the better sandwiches you will ever eat then I would highly recommend this place.They also take visa, mastercard, and discover.
i am still a fan, especially as someone who has been many times, so i know my order. my only complaint these days is that for the Ike's virgins they no longer have the menus out to choose from. now they suggest to use your iphone and look it up yourself. after an entire weekend of craziness at pride our phones had died so that wasnt an option. i got the menage-a-tois as did the Ik'es newbie, however it just wasnt the same ambiance and obviously didnt capture the great Ike's as i had bragged.so dear Ike'sPLEASE BRING BACK YOUR MENUS. it is much more convenient and actually quite odd for you not to have a menu anyway!
Sandwich was good. Amazing? No. Life Changing? No. But it was a solid, good sandwich.
Can Yelp do anything about destroying the morons who gave this place anything lower than a 4?I can't ever give a 5 to a place that's technically fast food yet still take 45 mintues. I understand they're making everything fresh and they have a tiny kitchen. I get it. Still. Purely food, it's a 5+Make sure you study their list of of 100+ sandwiches on their website. That's right 100+, not to mention the millions of other combinations you can create by adding other heart-clogging goodness to your sub.Try Shawn Michaels (Steak, Mozarella Sticks, Bacon) + Jalapeno Poppers and also the "Say Hey" (Pastrami, Bacon, Swiss) + Mozarella SticksYou're welcome.
There's a Philly Cheese steak and then there's Ike's Hollywood Philly Cheese Steak.This is the first thing I try at all sandwich places. And probably one of my regular items at my regular sandwich places. And this place really had they own extremely juicy, creamy and cheesy Philly cheese Steak.5 Stars!Please do get some more chairs. I had to eat sitting on the sidewalk, but it was a nice day though. :)
The sandwiches here were pretty good. I was especially impressed by the meatless meatball. The hole in the wall San Francisco vibe was a nice change of pace from the restaurants in So. Cal. that I'm used to eating at. Not a bad place to grab a bite.___edit 12/11Went back here a few weeks ago. The BIGGER restaurant and the sandwich "Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian (on dutch crunch)" forces my hand to bump this to a 5 star review. WOW, that was good.Favorite sandwich joint in SF! ... Also, the only one I've been to in SF.
Hey-o! As I write this I see that tonight is Ike's birthday party. I sure wish I could be there, to shake the man's hand. Alas, I am at the other end of the state, but I am there in spirit. Anyway...Seeing as this place has almost 5 stars after over 700 reviews, my input is really not needed. But I am going to throw down anyway. This is the greatest sandwich place in the whole world. I dream about it at night, I can almost hear the sweet, soft voice of the Veggie Pride of the Castro calling to me on the wind, singing me its siren song barely audible above the whisper of the willows in the darkness. (It could be the voice of any of the other innumerable veggie or vegan sandwiches, but the Veggie Pride is my muse.) Yeah, this place inspires some Romantics-style poetry. It makes me a better woman. I have never had a trouble with waiting too long for a sandwich, but always because I call ahead and always it is ready for me. Really, what's the use of complaining about things taking a long time in San Francisco? Everybody here is moneyed and in the know about where to get the good food. Chances are, if it's tasty, you will have to wait for it, regardless of when you go.And everybody behind the counter is so nice. Even though I don't care for Tootsie roll pops so much I love the fact that they include one with your sandwich. It just goes to show you how they care. Happy belated birthday, Ike, and thank you. Thank you very much.
It's a good sandwich, obviously, no doubting that. Is it a "I will wait in line 2 hours because it is so damn good" sandwich... hmmm, it just might be. Def a place everyone should check out, and base on the number of reviews, it looks like everyone has. I am looking forward to my next visit, this time I will bring a folding beach chair, Ipod and 12'er to help pass the time.
my only complaint is that they stopped delivering. bring it back ike's!!! bring it back!!!!
I felt like I was in one of those Carl's Jr. commercials when I ate my sandwich from this place--I couldn't tell if the hot lesbians watching me eat were checking me out or horrified at the mess I was making. I got the Change sandwich (beef, gouda, onion rings, bbq sauce) and thoroughly enjoyed it. I debated the five star rating just a bit based on the minimal seating, but decided it probably just adds to the tiny, homey feel of the place. I would suggest looking at the menu before you go since I got there and was totally overwhelmed by all the options and could tell the lady at the register was anxious for me to order. I apparently was there during happy hour and was told I got a free drink and chips since my sandwich was over $6.99. I couldn't tell you when that applies, but I was there at 4pm on a Monday. Speaking of which, I feel like the posted hours might be wrong since people were still in line and ordering when I left and it was close to 5. Basically, really tasty sandwiches (and salt/vinegar chips and cream soda).
Whenever I'm back in the City I try and stop by Ike's for I've never had a sandwich as insanely filling and mouth watering as the one at Ike's. It's worth the wait and hype! The Legend of Zelda, Spiffy Tiffy, and Menage a Trois are my top 3 favorites but I'm pretty sure everything on the menu won't disappoint.
Something to try, but nothing to write home about. We tried the Shawn Michaels, Super Mario, A Superman, and I think a Doomsday. We called in the sandwiches ahead of time, because we were told that was the best way or else we might be stuck in a line. Went home and traded with friends. The sandwiches were good, but really just sandwiches. Yes, they were big and stacked, but thats how subs are aren't they? these just had way more meat in them and instead of cheese slices they came with cheese sticks. so I mean that was the only twist. I don't know if i would go out of my way to eat that sandwich again
This place is seriously "touch yourself good." If you have out-of-town guests, you have to invite them to experience the celestial sandwiches from here. Trick is to order on the phone and go grab it. Lines suck.
Review # 373. Gonna have to agree with Ross M. in that this place is addictive - I drive here (yes, I know I should ride my bike) for their vegan meatball sandwich, which is orgasmically delicious. I'm sure everything else is great too.Ike's a good guy, I recommend calling ahead, and I stole a bunch of your napkins today. I'm sorry.
I'm a fan. The sandwiches can be hit and miss on the amazing scale, but even when they are a miss - they are good.The bread is what makes it so yummy. It helps to look at the website before going there because it is quite extensive and can be overwhelming to decide on the spot.I think this place is a very strong contender for top sandwich spot in the bay area, but I still give my vote for that category to little lucca as the sauces there are amazing and its a better value for the price. Although, I will admit that I have not tried all the sauces this place has to offer.
I visited this place a few days ago with three friends of mine. Every one of us left with the feeling that we had just eaten the very best sandwiches in existence. God bless Ike and his establishment!I had the "Change" which had steak, bbq sauce, onion rings, and gouda cheese. This was one AMAZING sandwich. Incredibly tasting! It also filled me up quite well. My three [female] friends could barely finish half of their sandwiches.Also great, besides their sandwiches, were the fries with the four dipping sauces (honey mustard, ranch, bbq, and ketchup). They tasted fresh and delicious. The staff were hilarious, friendly, and quite useful... especially Nacho Boy. Basically, if you are going to be in San Fran, go to Ike's Place. There IS a reason why it has like 700 five star reviews...
Sandwiches were fantastic, staff was great, not a fault but could have used some seating. Seems like it was designed to be an eat-out restaurant.
Freaking hell, what a good sandwich. I knew we would be eating well in San Francisco, but I expected the highlights to be Chinese, Italian, Mexican, and seafood (and they were...), but sandwiches? Not the first thing that springs to mind when I think SF. Ike's certainly will. Quite possibly the best sandwich I've ever eaten, which is just ridiculous to think about. I mean, I wasn't stoned, I was completely sober! Best EVER? Yeah... I think it was. The line was long and slow, but everyone was super nice and the food was incredible. Taking our sandwiches over to Dolores Park and enjoying an absolutely beautiful early afternoon was one of the top experiences we had all week. We finished the evening at Gary Danko. Yeah, it was a good day with two of the best meals I've ever had (and one of them was 10x more expensive than the over!)
Ohh MMM Gee... the most delicious sandwich ever! My friend Jon kept telling us about his friend Ike's sandwich place, so I drove down from San Jo to check it out. Totally worth it. I had Jon El's TB and it was the best turkey burger I've ever had. The dutch crunch bread and the dirty sauce was delish! Never had a TB like that before. We ate at 3 and I was stuffed for the rest of the day. I even debated on whether or not I should have ordered a second sandwich to take home for later.  I didn't :( And now I'm sad. Next time I'm taking one for the road....even though it may have to wait until the next day to eat. Sooo much goodness in one place.
Whooooa. Was I the only one that Ike forgot to slip some crack into my sandwich? All these Yelpers seem hooked, but I don't see the big deal. I had a veggie sandwich that was ok, but also had a brick of cream cheese in it. Sure, if you put a block of fat in a sandwich, it's going to taste good. But otherwise, it was so-so. And the 20-30 minute post-ordering sidewalk wait outside was so not becoming. I'll give it another try one of these days, though.
WOW! i never knew sandwiches could taste so good! seriously, it was like an orgasm in my mouth. not to mention that the guy who helped my friend and i out was super nice. but its helpful to look at the online menu before going to the place causeit'll make life much easier. there is so much on the menu i couldn't choose! but i went for the "Not Tonight, I have a Headache" and let me tell you, this sandwich can take all of your headache's away.can't wait to go back!
You know, sometimes when you write a review, especially for a place that has many four and five star reviews as Ike's does (not to mention immense media exposure and love), you dig through the recesses of your brain to find something, anything wrong. You don't want to be a follower, a mindless zombie that bleats "yes, I agree" to every point other Yelpers have made about this place.But seriously. There's not a single thing I can say about Ike's that's bad. True, I've only had one full sandwich and a taste of a second, but that one sandwich was so flavorful, so perfect, so cheerfully prepared and handed to me that I have no choice but to award this place the full five stars.My personal order for today was the MILF sandwich, which I was drawn to not only because it has one of the best names on the menu (though not as great as Hella Fat Bastard), but also because it looked like it was one of the spicier sandwiches on the menu. I got it on the now legendary Dutch Crunch roll. My fiancee got the Sometimes I'm Vegetarian (which, in her case, is a lie, since she's always a vegetarian, but I guess that doesn't matter since I don't regularly eat MILFs, either), also on a Dutch Crunch. After our sandwiches were prepared, we wandered over to Dolores Park, sat in the shade, and blissfully munched away on our sandwiches. There was so much flavor packed into the sandwich - the crunch of the toasted bread, the first hit of the Dirty Sauce, the secondary crunch of the jalapeno poppers, the cream cheese blast that followed, and finally the buffalo-flavored shredded chicken. So many flavors, working in perfect concert. I tried the Sometimes I've Vegetarian, too - great flavor there as well, but I'll let her describe it in her review.Now that I'm a freshly-transplanted Bay Area resident, I have one of my first goals: conquer the Ike's menu. I can do it. I will do it. Or I will explode trying.
After months of moving everywhere around the area and me having to find the damn thing, they finally settled at this new spot, which is pretty huge but don't expect to be sitting down and eating there. The sandwiches are amazing--my favorite sandwiches in the city. Nacho boy is so good and their sauce is what makes it different. I always try to go here no matter what even if its out of the way. If I'm craving a sandwich--My first thought would be Ikes...
Went with Camille R. Ordered "Lizzy's Lips," which was pretty good. Camille had a BLT with avocado, which I wasn't terribly impressed with. Slightly above average prices, even for the City. After waiting about 20 minutes, we asked them if our order was about to be up. Turns out they had lost it, and we had to wait another 10 minutes. They were cool though, gave up free drinks and chips while we waited and apologized several times. There was a car accident (and lots of commotion) right when we ordered, so this was probably just a freak thing.
I am no longer an Ike's Virgin!I took my parent's to Ike's, knowing how much hype it gets, I had super high expectations. Not only did Ike's live up to it's name, but the people working there were super friendly, and not intimidating (even though I am sure it was obvious that it was our first time.) Our sandwiches were even handed to us by Ike himself. These people were so great they even pronounced my mother's name right...it's Ag-nes, not Angus, not Agney...Next time I go I will be sure to look at the complete menu online.
My wife and I ventured out to this little sandwich shop not knowing what we were going to get or what we should expect. I have to say that we both came out pleasantly surprised and very full! The sandwiches were ordered were well put together. The ingredients were fresh and the stuffings were plenty. What made the sandwich for both of us, though, was the bread. We ordered the sandwiches to go and didn't get back to our hotel until an hour and a half after leaving the sandwich shop. I ate my sandwich about 2.5 hours after leaving the sandwich shop and the bread and ingredients were still fresh. My wife didn't eat hers until 4.5 hours after leaving the shop and she was amazed that the bread and ingredients were still fresh.The place is small (they have a couple tables outside and their ordering counter only allows 1-2 patrons at a time... plus, the line goes out the door if more than 2-3 small groups are waiting to order) but the customer service is excellent - the guy taking our order made ordering really easy. I would confidently recommend this sandwich shop to anyone visiting or living in SF.Quick tip: If you go between 4 and 7 (I think it ends around 7) you get free chips and a drink (this is their version of a happy hour).
There's a reason why this place has over 1000+ reviews! They're delicious! Ike's is no frills, order your sandwich and find a seat on the sidewalk type of place. They have over 100 different types of sandwiches so that made decisions a bit harder.Their dirty sauce, which is on all their sandwiches, is an aioli mayonnaise that adds a nice extra kick to your bread. They also have the Dutch crunch bread as an option which is crunchy on the outside but so heavenly soft on the inside.
amazing. had the spiffy tiffy. so good. best sandwich ever.
I finally had my first Ike's sandwich today! I've heard so many positive reviews about Ike's sandwiches that I just had to try one for myself. My friends and I decided to get sandwiches to bring to the Radio Alice's Now and Zen concert. Let me tell you...I was sooo surprised at how small this place is. This is not a sit down place to eat. They just have a wooden stand out side to take orders and the two chairs next to it is the waiting area. I had the NAME OF THE GIRL I'M DATING. It was a chicken, honey mustard, avocado, and pepperjack cheese on Dutch Crunch bread. the dirty sauce (which i was told was a garlic spread) that comes on every sandwich made it really good. it was just awesome!I wanted to get their guilt-free fries, but they told me that they only serve that on weekdays...bummers. So I tried their jalapeno poppers. They were just ok to me, but the cream cheese was really smooth inside, like they whipped it before putting it in.I will definitely come back again. I gotta try the other sandwiches there...they have a lot of different kinds!
em ef hell ya.i can't say enough good things about a small sandwich shop that does sandwiches right. don't eat one of these sandwiches if you lack napkins or are wearing all white. i think i got a number 98, or was it 96? i spent about 5 mins looking through the binder of sandwiches available.
So lots of reviews on what sandos TASTE GOOD: unique and balanced flavors, variety of sauce. But there's so much more than that! It's in the details:1.  Great bread, crusty but will never tear up the roof of your mouth2. The meat is sliced very thin3. The chicken is shredded so you're never fighting to get a bite 4. Very friendly and helpful service to help navigate the menu5. The cheese is always meeeeeelted6. Call in orders, pick it up and hurry to the park to enjoy! Don't waste any valuable fun in the sun time waiting indoors for your sandwich7. Open til 10
I must admit, as far as hot sandwiches goes, this place is pretty top. I'm giving Ike's a 5 for a few simple reasons - 1) the SELECTION of meats, cheeses, and combinations of toppings and extras is very impressive2) it's a good amount of food for what you pay for3) service is great, friendly, and funand as a bonus...4) all the customers there are (usually) in a good mood, which elevates and improves your own mood as wellI also have realized after coming here, cold sandwiches and hot sandwiches are two different arenas - and Ike's so far is my top hot place to be!
Was so excited to try this place - maybe it was all the hype but it just didn't live up. It was ok, and maybe I just didn't order the "right" thing, but it definitely was not worth the long wait in line. I much prefer Freddie's Sandwiches on Pine St!
Hmmmm mmmmmm mmmmmm good! My co-worker heard about this place from her mom who was watching Best of the Bay (Ike's was voted as one of the best sandwich places in SF), so we checked out their website and instantly knew this was a must-see just because the names of their sandwiches. It's like no other sandwich place I've ever been too. One Friday during lunch we ventured out to Ike's to find that it was literally a hole in the wall. The place was as big as a handicapped bathroom stall (ok, maybe I'm exaggerating) but they sure do compensate with their out of this world sandwiches. Definitely a cool vibe instantly. Be prepared for your first visit to know that there is barley any seating. You may have to stoop it. First time I got a M.I.L.F (very appropriate for me in more ways than one: 1) I am a damn MILF, haha 2) basically my dream sandwich, my co-workers already knew that the ingredients in there were a Michelle kinda sandwich) HALAL CHICKEN BREAST, STUFFED JALAPENO PEPPERS, FRANKS RED HOT SAUCE, AND RANCH. TO DIE FOR! And today I got a DIRTY CA ROLL (no meat for Lenten season), it's basically your typical California roll ingredients. But their "DIRTY SAUCE" is what makes their sandwiches a hit...still a mystery to know the concoction of their dirty sauce. Guaranteed that you will be satisfied with their service, quality, and quantity! And for kicks they give a Tootsie Pop with every sandwich! Where else can you order a "HELLA FAT BASTARD with EXTRA DIRTY SAUCE!" without offending anyone?
Okay...first of all, I'll let you know that I didn't have to wait in line. I went to this little place near closing time, which meant no wait for ordering or for the food to come out (only about 5 mins). So that seriously influences my rating.Ike's sandwiches have character. They push the envelope. The sandwiches have a ton of flavor and they get the mix just right (except for one thing...see below.)Now for the bad: the place looks dingy and dirty. Butter: they use lots of it. I've heard this more than once from more than one chef: "If you screwed it up, just add butter and it'll taste better". So, are they adding all that butter to make up for shortcomings?I'll end with this: I'll come back, but if there is a long line, I'm probably going to skip this place and go somewhere else (but I am impatient).
Best sandwich I've ever eaten, no question. My favorite sandwich is the sexy boy (#69 of course): rib eye & mozzarella sticks. The quality of ingredients is excellent- they bake the bread for your sandwich when you order and the dirty sauce seals deal. Some reviewers complained about the long line- I always call mine in ahead.
Great sandwich's and even better soda/drink selection. Pricey though. I spent 12 bucks on a sandwich and drink. I ordered the Paul Reuben which was great. Came on a dutch crunch roll and loaded with fresh toppings. The bread was dipped in a buttery garlic topping. Had a nice mix of flavors, probably bc the cole slaw on the Reuben was mixed with poppy seed dressing. All in all it was delicious. If you're looking for a standard semi healthy deli sandwich(and cheap) this is not the place to go. But if you're looking for a hearty fat bomb, come here!! The service is great too. Nice and welcoming!
Amazing sandwiches! I ordered the Veggie Love Triangle sandwich w/avocado and banana peppers... definitely the best sandwich I have had. Lines are very long, so recommend calling in your order an hour in advance and they will have it ready for you when you arrive. This way you can skip the order line and directly pick up and pay. I would recommend Ike's to anyone that is a sandwich lover or not. Just check out their menu and you'll know what I mean.
I wasn't ever a sandwich fan until I tried these sandwiches, I was happy they brought one closer to me in Oakland. Recommend to everyone!
Ho...ly....CRAP! How I didn't know about this place before a month ago, I have no idea. FOR SHAME! Certainly glad I know about it now. Over 200 of their named sandwich combos or build your own. The best of worlds for meat lovers, vegetarians and full on vegans alike! All Hail Ike's: SF Sandwich King!
Finally, on my third visit to Ike's, I actually ate here.My first time, I took forever to find a parking spot after dropping my mom and sister off to order. There was a line out the door, and we had time constraints, so we ended up going elsewhere. The second time, I had heard yet again how amazing Ike's Sandwiches were, drove by, spotted that line again and decided to pass on it. Again.The third time being a charm, we headed here on a Saturday afternoon, around 2 pm - and we lucked OUT! No line to order, though there were at least 7-8 people waiting for their orders, and we even scored seating outside (1 of the 2 tables available). So, was it worth it?Absolutely.This is not your typical sandwich place where you come when you don't have time. You need LOTS of time to eat here as we waited at least 20 minutes for our food, after we placed our order. I ordered a Turkey/Avocado sandwich on sourdough. I have to say the bread was excellent, the turkey was fresh as can be, and avocados were perfectly ripened. Everything they use is FRESH.That said - - it's not MY idea of a sandwich. Sandwiches, to me, are crisp, light, fresh, and tasty. Ike's has fresh and tasty down, but it's not light by any means. The piping hot, fresh bread is oozing with butter, and there's tons of good flavors in here, but all go against "light". These sandwiches are serious business - - they compete with the best of burgers, not sandwiches.Portioning was also impressive - - I finished one half, started on the other half and then had to bring it home in a doggie bag.In conclusion, I'd recommend that if you're in the mood for comfort food type of sandwiches, you're hungry, and want some delicious sandwiches - - head to Ike's. You'd be hardpressed NOT to like anything you order here. Furthermore, Ike and his staff, including his lovely mother, make it feel really personal and homey when you visit. You just can't go wrong here.TIP: You can actually call in and place your order, pick it up at a later, designated time. I'd DEFINITELY recommend that here if you don't have a good amount of time.
We came here for Cece's UYE event on a Sunday evening. I think I would've enjoyed the sandwiches more if it wasn't so cold outside, so I'll try to factor that out of my rating. The names of the sandwiches here are really interesting because most of them have been crafted by the owner (Ike) himself. There are names such as Backstabber, Menage a Trois, Ex-boyfriend, etc. It seems like whatever ingredients are in these sandwiches are the ones that were on his mind when he was in these situations.I had the Menage a Trois (halal chicken, honey, honey mustard, smoked Gouda, bbq sauce), which had alot of flavor from the honey and bbq sauce. As the name implies, it was an extremely messy sandwich. We got great service from Ike himself who delivered us our sandwiches and chatted with us to make sure we were well accommodated.
Um, this place is Top! Top! Top! I was expecting a good sandwich, I mean 644 yelpers could not have done me wrong on this place. So I went in with high hopes- which usually is not the best way to go in for things.Okay-so parking may not be so easy-but when is it in the city?I went plain for my first trip to Ike's and just got the turkey on sourdough, with sprouts, lettuce, pickles, tomato, mayo, dirty sauce. The turkey was AMAZING! so much flavor, and so moist! the bread was grilled and so it was warm, chewy, and so delish! I am usually not a fan of warm sandwiches, but this was the best sandwich I have had in a really long time. Actually, I will go ahead and give this place the best hot sandwich ever award! well in my book anyway. They have some unique drink choices= 5 starsHUGE sandwich selection= 5 starsDELISH MEAT and bread= 5 StarsDirty sauce= 5 starsmaking me a happy girl= 5 starsnow, this place is itty bitty, so be warned that you'll be eating at one of their 3 tables if you get to be so lucky. However, it wouldnt be all that bad eating in the car, on the street, whereva as long as you are eating at ike's!oh-and Ike himself was there passing out the sammies, and helping in the kitchen- total props!only negative note is that they only have one location-so I don't get to have more of it for awhile :(, and they don't serve these famous fries on the weekends-the only time I will ever be able to come by :(, Ike-I would really like to try your sides-please reconsider your no sides on the weekends bit. This place is so good, and I was so blown away by my yumm-o sammie that I'm putting Ike's into my favorite restaurant category! Yum, Yum, Yum!Oh-and thanks for the lolli-pop at the end ;)
Hooray, they're delicious!!!Booh hiss, it takes an hour and a half to get a sandwich on the weekend! :(Call ahead, hours before you're hungry. I love the Paul Rubens
WOW!!!!Be prepared to wait! If you're in a rush, then phone your orders here, but if its your first time here, then maybe you want to experience it like everyone else.Plan to wait about 30 mins to place your order and another 20 to get your food.We ordered 5 sandwiches (some were the same).1: Say Hey- brother loved it2. Napoleon - sister and bf's sister loved it3. Name of the girl you are dating (2)-FANTASTIC4. i forgot the name, but it had 3 types of meats in thereOrder came out to $47. You can probably get full of half a sandwich. Expect to get dirty because of their famous dirty sauce. Have lots of napkins ready.The staff their is friendly. The manager actually brings your order out and repeats your order for you. They also add in those caramel apple candies. There are small tables outside so be quick so you can grab a table-that way you can enjoy your sandwich before the crunchiness of the dutch roll goes away.I WILL BE BACK
Hype is only hype if it's exaggerated. Ike's is not hyped. These sandwiches are legit! It's a strange partnership they've got going with Lime, though. They really need their own shop again. There, that's my 2 cents worth to get them that much closer to 3k reviews (currently at 2915).
ZOMG! BEST SANDWICH PLACE EVER. YES, I'M GOING TO WRITE THIS WHOLE REVIEW IN CAPS BECAUSE I WANT TO PROCLAIM TO THE WORLD HOW AMAZING THIS JOINT IS! I HAD THE ELVIS KEITH, AND JUST HAVING ONE SANDWICH CONVINCED ME IKE'S OFFERINGS ARE GOLD. GO...FOR THE LOVE OF GOD...YOU NEED TO GO AND GET A SAMMICH. And mail me one here on the East Coast. *longing sigh*
My sister and I ate here yesterday before seeing a show at the Fillmore and we ordered the kryptonite to share. (Thanks to the Man vs. Food show) The sandwich was huge and full of every meat, veggie and fried food you could imagine. I won't go on and on with another great review for Ike's. But the next time your in the city and must give this place a try.
If I were to die tomorrow, I hope it would be after I had eaten a sandwich from Ike's. (Of course, the death would not have been due to the sandwhich, even if it were, I'm pretty sure it's worth it, but it's not, so don't think their sandwiches will kill you!)You da man, Ike! Please don't change anything about your place! It's perfect exactly the way it is.My friends have been gnawing at me for months about how great this place is...then they keep going without me! Well, that's what I get for being so busy. Finally, I get a day off and head out there. Even on a windy SF afternoon, the place is still spawning with hungry patrons, where every outdoor seat is filled and then some. The BFF's got the Nacho Boy. Not really sure what was in it, not nacho apparently, but I saw avacado in it, on dutch crunch. The brother got the Super Mario, which was meatballs with spaghetti sauce and mozerella, and I had the SF cheesesteak sammich, all on dutch crunch. I'm not a picky eater, so I said YES! to all the vegetables. I liked how they cut the sandwich in half after they wrapped it, so all the good stuff wasn't falling out.I made sure I gave myself the perfect last bite (cause that's how you eat a sammich) you know, the bite with everything in it: some thinly sliced steak, swiss cheese, peperoncini, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, uh, other stuff...sorry, too busy stuffing my face to notice the other things in it.I can go on about this great sandwich joint, which not only has great food, but great service. It was really cool how Ike personally handed everyone their orders. But it really doesn't get any better than this. Like the other reviewer wrote, I would love to see this joint thrive and grow and take over the world!IKE'S FOR EVERYONE!!
AMAZING!By far the best sandwich in town. My favorite is the "I'm coming home for thanksgiving" with brie.
Uhhhh.... I got the Meatless Mike a few days ago, and it was almost $13. I can't afford to get sandwiches here anymore... that's insane! $10 was bad enough, but this was... there are no words. Booo.
I ran across all of the great reviews and had to check it out for myself last Saturday. I am not the biggest lover of sandwiches although I can appreciate a good one when I get the chance to sync my teeth into one. I must say Ike's makes a damn good one, one of the best I have had in a while. If I was rating only the food, I would give them 5 stars, however there are a few drawbacks. Parking is not easy in the Castro, I parked illegally and prayed to the Parking Gods to watch over me. The wait to get your sandwich seemed a bit long for making a sandwich and I was really hungry so between the two things it seemed to take even longer. The place is super cramped so hope for a nice day or plan on eating your food elsewhere because there is nowhere to eat it but outside. I will defiantly be back if all of the stars align meaning, available parking, not a long line and I am not in a rush to go somewhere. Or as JB mentions in his review below, you can call it in, perhaps that is a good idea if I knew what to order, so many good things to choose from!
best. sandwiches. ever.Spiffy Tiffy & Count of Monte Chase-O were both very good. I originally wanted to replace the Chase-O swiss cheese with brie, but they said they don't carry brie anymore :( But the strawberry preserve in the sandwich definitely hit the spot. We called around 6pm on a Sunday to order the sandwiches and we were able to pick it up around 15 minutes later. Oh, and the dutch crunch bread.....just do it! ;)
The Reuben is Ike's favorite sandwich. Get it! Delicious! Juicy as hell.They have Jolt Cola. I didn't know that stuff is still sold.
Uh, absolutely amazing!  Look at the menu online and pick your sandwich before you go or even better call in your order and skip the long wait! I also have to say that Ike is a true example of what giving great customer service is all about. I can tell he loves his job and he loves meeting his customers. Also, each time I have gone to Ike's, the employees are also very friendly and it appears that they love their job too!
I read all the rave reviews so I ventured over with the fiance. I got the custom made sammy with salame and ham. The salame was more like pepperoni and I didn't really taste the "dirty sauce". The fiance got the Superman and he didn't really taste the special sauce either. The dutch crunch bread was great though. I'll come back to give it another shot, but overall, it's OK. Note: I got there around 7ish on a weekday and there was no wait at all.
I can't believe I haven't reviewed Ike's! Possibly the best sandwiches, with the best names, bar none--ANYWHERE.Located conveniently off Castro street, Ike's is a San Fran institution, like the 49ers, and Coit Tower.There's not a lot of seating (in fact, there are two or three tiny tables outside) and the places it'self is the size of a postage stamp, with sandwich makers working elbow to elbow.It's worth the entertainment value alone to see these guys in action--they get along well, and are hilariously funny. I couldn't help but giggle every time one of them yelled out "I need a couple balls over here!" for the meatball sandwich he was working on.I'd say this place is great only if the weather is great and you can walk your sandwich to some outdoor place (like a park, or a benc somewhere) but this place kicks ass even in the rain.I miss Ike's when I'm out of town.
I won't be typical and say "I Like Ike." I LOVE Ike!!! He is so friendly!!Went to his place for the first time yesterday, and the friendly employees didn't give me shiz for ordering one of their "unoriginal" sandwiches (really, it says this on the menu--I found it funny) It was the best turkey sandwich I have ever had, the roasted turkey tasted so fresh.I want to go back and try pretty much everything, there are so many innovative combos. And I LOOOOVVVVVEEEEE the names of some of them. So funny. My sorta place.When taking my order, Ike took my name and asked "it's spelled Amy, right?" Since he asked, I spelled out my name to him, saying that I really don't care unless it's on a legal document, but he really wanted to know. I thought that was kinda cool.Even more cool is finding at the bottom of my sandwich bag a carmel apple sucker for dessert. Sweet!!!!!This place is uber popular, I would suggest phoning in your order first and coming by, sneering at the suckas in line (that was me yesterday) while you pick up your sammy.Not much in the way of seating, but don't be shy----pull up some curb or sidewalk. Or walk to Dolores Park.
It was fun reading all the comments I got from people when I posted my status on facebook: "In the Castro getting the name of the girl I'm dating from ike's place."That alone should give it 5 stars. I came here intrigued by what I saw on Man v Food. I was scared to start off with the Superman or the Kryptonite so I thought I'd ease myself into this by starting off with the Name of the Girl I'm Dating. Great start!! First of all, when we drove up to this place, there was a huge crowd of people lined up down the street at aound 3pm on the Saturday before Labor Day. I thought to myself, this place must be AWESOME! I hate waiting and crowds and my friends and I were starving! So, we actually went to another place Adam Richman went to on his food adventure in SF, Taqueria la Cumbre. My friend read on yelp that we can order ahead and they give a pickup time. That was the best advice ever!! We ordered our sandwiches and they gave us a 2 hr pickup time of 5:55pm. After having burritos, we walked around utnil 5:55 came around, and headed back to Ike's. There was still a crowd at this time, I think I heard the wait was 45 min. We waited in line to get to the counter, but Ike told us we didn't have to wait in line next time. If we call in the order, we can skip up ahead. Good to know for next time! :)I have to say, it was all so worth it. Even though I had burrito in my tummy, I still ate half of my sandwich!! It was so good! The bread is like garlic bread, where its crunch on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside... omg i think im drooling just thinking about it. I will be back, and will be sure to call in my order ahead of time. I'm going to make my bf get the Superman and I'll get the Kryptonite haha
Ike's Place is one of the two best sandwich places that I've tried anywhere on the West Coast. They offer delicious food served up by some of the sweetest people in town, and they attract a host of fun neighborhood characters who add life to the place.A minority of reviewers here are dense enough to mistake the lack of a parking lot for a BUG. It's a FEATURE, a secret to Ike's success, otherwise known as the DoucheFilter(tm).This miraculous new technology repels crass, potbellied, boring douchebags from the Marina and the South Bay who still live in the dark ages and drive enormous toy trucks everywhere they go. Thanks to the DoucheFilter(tm), Ike's has become a new neighborhood cornerstone, infused with wonderful, friendly, casual, old-school San Francisco charm.You know what else lacks parking? The island of Manhattan. Does that knock NYC down to 2 stars in your book?If you can't manage to waddle two grueling blocks from the Church Street muni station to Ike's, then yank your head out of your arse, drive home to Santa Clara and stop rating sandwich joints based on whether they take care of your precious Hummer. And have a nice day.
Ehhh this place is really pricey ... Sometimes lines were ridiculous. And maybe alittle overhyped for me.
I ate a fantastic sandwhich from Ike's Place. Thank you Yelp!!It's a long wait, so be ready to stand around for a long time if you decide to eat here.
Superb sandwiches!! So many options and so very affordable. Call ahead.
Vegan Strawberry Sandwich = bomb.com. Normally vegan sandwiches taste like grass smothered between two pieces of cardboard, but this just blew every other sandwich out of the park (meat sandwiches included). It was toasted to perfection, the sauce was boss, and I finished every last bite (wasn't even hungry). Ike...whoever you are... God bless you.
See all other reviews. This place is great (although the atmosphere is a bit odd now that they're in a club ha ha)
The words, heavenly, amazing, and oh man that was the best sandwich I've ever had come to mind. My culinary choices are usually limited especially in the sandwich realm since I'm allergic to wheat. Well there's a little space in my heart for Ike's because they thought of people like me and have gluten-free bread. I had an Eli Manning sandiwch on my gluten free bread, and it was hands-down the best sandwich I've ever had. The shop is very small (a few tables outside), but everyone is super friendly, and oh man are the sandwiches amazing. Go and eat your heart out. Yummmm.
Ike's gets five stars because it is that good. I just feel blessed to live so close to Ike's.Ike's neighbors get negative eleventy billion stars for making them close at 7 pm! Love these sandwich heroes.
I love this place, the people are friendly. The pesto sauce on my sandwich was amazing! The dutch crunch bread made the experience that much better. I would definitely be coming back here. Honestly, nothing else compares to Ike's they have unique names for sandwiches and amazing people.
yumamazing vegan sandwhiches. I had one with veggie chicken and avocado- sooo yummmy. worth a wait.
How good can a friggin sandwich be? That's what I was thinking after hearing people rave about this sammy shop so much. "Ike's! Ike's! OMG Ike's!!!" It's as if Ike has turned all of San Francisco into a bunch of prepubescent teeny boppers, treating him like a pantydropping rockstar, stopping just short of throwing their training bras at his store.Finally I succumbed to the hype and decided to give Ike's a shot. I had the meatless meatball sandwich. It really is as great as everyone says. It was filling, messy, and super tasty - what I expected after reading all of the Yelp reviews. The lollipop that came along with our sandwiches was a nice touch that made me "Awww" and the crap load of veg options on the menu (and not just your typical "block of cheese and some bread" options) made my jaw drop (not quite the panties).I didn't experience the horrendous wait that everyone writes about, I guess because I was there moments before he was closing and the orders had tapered off. What really impressed me though occurred after Ike had closed, and just about everyone was gone. He was outside eating his own sandwich while two people inside were doing prep work for the following day. Two kids drove up ten minutes too late. They were clearly disappointed that they got there after closing; they complained that they had driven so far to try the place. They talked to Ike while he was eating and he actually got up from eating and took their orders. Wow. I was impressed. This is a business that I would love to see thrive.So how good can a friggin sandwich be? Effing delicious, people. Effing. Delicious. I plan on returning again, and again to eat Ike's meatless meatballs (um, panties on, of course).
How do you review a phenomenon? Ike's Place has gone through the roof, yet, they are somehow keeping it together and doing a fantastic job! I can't imagine how every sandwich shop should be able to do what Ike's does, but, they don't. I have a feeling there is at least a ton of business management school profiles and maybe even a business book hidden within the story of Ike's Place. But, that is all academic. The real deal is the food and the experience. Well, first, it is like waiting in line for admission to a [insert name of latest obscure hipster band that hasn't made gone "mainstream" yet] concert. - A LOT of crabby, hungover, pushy hipsters wearing skinny jeans, trucker hats and "ironic" eye glass frames all stewing away for their chance to order or to receive their sandwich. Also, the place's decor is much more casual than I expected from descriptions - the chairs and tables are all mismatched, the signs are all sort of hand written and tacked to the walls, the beverage cooler has seen better days, and the back is pretty chaotic. From the ecstatic reviews I expected things to be pretty humble and low-budget, but not necessarily chaotic. Somehow, though, none of this matters. I considered lopping off a star for the experience of the wait, but, Ike keeps zipping in and out to hand over sandwiches, and, since he is personable and friendly, he sort of counteracts the crabby hipster vibe. Ike is clearly a great boss and really understands customer service. I saw him negotiate a couple of minor complaints during my near-hour of time there and each time he was friendly, focused and did whatever it took to please the customer. Ike is also clearly the force and inspiration behind the place and I think it is appropriate that everyone pays him back the respect and love that he puts into his business. One of the definite charms of Ike's Place is the creative juxtaposition of ingredients and flavors in the sandwiches and their names. I went with a fairly standard Paul Reubens, but, using a red cabbage slaw instead of sauerkraut was ingenious and delicious. The other pillar of excellence is that the sandwiches are demonstrably made with fresh high quality ingredients. The meats, vegetables, and especially the fresh baked bread (I had the dutch crunch) combine in a synergistic symphony of flavors that exceed the deliciousness of the individual components. Truly here, in taste, the sum is greater than the parts. Finally, I also have to say that the passion and professionalism of the crew enhances my opinion of Ike's Place. They all seemed so focused on their jobs yet seemed to be really enjoying themselves. They all seemed to be in that "flow" that everyone is supposed to realize when they are truly working to their full potential and doing something they love. Like I said, this may come off as more of a MBA paper than a sandwich joint review, but, Ike's Place really has found a way to exceed my expectations and also transcends expectations.
I always get the spiffy tiffy and I'm never disappointed. Always good sandwiches!Suggestion: call in your order ahead of time so you don't have to wait too long in the line.
Why is the cost of living so high in SF? Because San Franciscans are spoilled with great places like Ike's. Never pass up the dirty sauce. Always call ahead to shorten the wait.
Ask yourself: "How can a sandwich be so great? A sandwich is a sandwhich." Then go see Ike.
First time I ate here a couple years ago, Ike personally delivered our lunch to us.  Was a wonderful and tasty sandwhich. I had the Barry Bonds, which has quickly become my favorite. Tender, juicy turkey, crisp and crunchy bacon, and very very tasty Dirty Sauce all over.  Make sure to order extra dirty sauce on your sandwhiches.  Needless to say, I have been back many times.  Keep it up!
SF Food Inspection Score: 90Oh man, this place is DANGEROUS!!!The sandwiches, I must say, are pretty f-in amazing.I had the Paradise Found sandwich (mozarella, ham, pineapple, and marinara) and I added grilled mushrooms. So good! It was like a pizza in my mouth! Ms Reina T. had a vegetarian BLT. The service was pleasant, sincere, and the food was the same.Want to avoid the line? Get there at 11am!
Great Sandwiches! It's the Secret Sauce and the Rolls! Horrible line! Call ahead!
Excellent sandwiches. All I have tried are great, Menage a Trois and Nacho Boy are my favorite.We need more Ike's Places!!
Ike's is awesome. This is not your regular sandwich, though, so expect to get messy with the dirty sauce. The reason I like Ike's is because it is not a sandwich you can easily recreate at home. It you're the type of person whose favorite sandwich is turkey and cheese on bread, Ike's is not for you. If you're willing to experiment and are ready for the most amazing sandwich of your life you should go to Ike's. I have come here numerous times and gotten a menage a trois, just friends and a matt cain. All the sandwiches are delicious, so you really can't go wrong. Ike will bring the sandwiches out to you when they are ready and he is the sweetest person. The line here gets long, so it's best to call ahead. If you want you sandwich at lunchtime you may want to call when they open and put in your order. This way you can just swing by and pick it up when it's ready instead. Overall, this place is fantastic. I highly recommend it if you want to have an out of the ordinary sandwich experience.
I've been having weird out-of-body experience feelings this last week, eating all these foods that I haven't had since going vegan over a year ago, or since going vegetarian like a million years ago. I had the vegan combo at Ike's this weekend, and it definitely brought me back to my pre-vegan sandwich days with it's many layers of veggie meat and soy cheese and veganaise (this stuff is the devil, btw).Recently someone actually said to me, "I don't get vegan sandwiches, what the heck is the point?" I thought about making a vegan sandwich and murdering him with it on the spot. I make a pretty damn good tofurkey sandwich. I'm in fact, something of a sandwich artist, if you will. I am very precise about the amounts of veggies, sauces and proteins in a sandwich, and though you may not think it makes a difference, once you try one, you will come back to me begging me to please make more and more perfectly proportioned sandwiches.To get to the point, I am very picky about sandwiches, and Ike's actually does a job that rivals my own. The proportions are right, the flavor is good, the variety is amazing. If you're not all into all the substitutes, they also have an unassuming hummus sandwich, but who's gonna waste their time on that?
So, I thought I'd update this review since I have eaten here a dozen times and I must say the sandwiches are consistently delicious!! My absolute must have is the "Name of Girl I'm dating." Anything made with Halal Chicken is the BiZOMB! And I always order it with everything on a Dutch crunch loaf. The sandwiches are always nicely toasted and warm and jam PACKED with flavor.I am also very happy with their service. I phone ordered my sandwich and as I got inside the tiny little shop, there was a line (of course). I was a little irked because I was waiting at the front counter while people were ordering their sandwich..the cashier was really busy (understandable) and finally got his attention and said I'm here for a pick up. He replied "oh, next time just scream out you're here for pick up, that way you don't have to wait. I'm really really sorry about that." His response was genuine, so I shrugged it off.But yes, this is the spot for a quick bite to eat in the Castro. It's a little pricey, but it's worth it honey!
Awesome + free chips! nuff said!
There's not much more I can say about this place that hasn't been said already. Bur i'm gonna be honest here knowing that I might make myself sound stupid.I didn't know that this place was vegetarian or could be i guess. So for those of you who may be as blonde as me, ALL the items on the menu can be made vegetarian, just ask. And after reading all the posts here, I was happy that I didn't wait in line for my meal at all, we walked right in. I guess it was the right time of day.I love the tootsie pops as well. Yum. My complaints:No spot inside to sit. San Francisco is Cold! A warm spot would be cool.No bathroom for patrons. I like to wash my hands.It's not located in my home town.I wish there were more places like this all over the bay area.
Came here right before they closed one night with my cousins visiting from Seattle, my sister, and my boyfriend. We all ordered something different, but overall everyone was extremely satisfied with their sandwich. The guys finished their huge sandwiches in less than ten minutes! I was driving, so I didn't have the chance to eat mine for about fifteen minutes..but it was still good! I highly recommend this place, and almost everything on their menu is yummy! Usually highly rated places seem to be overhyped and not as awesome as yelp makes them, but this place is a definite exception! Their sandwiches are the BOMB, and you NEED to try this place out!
ike's is an institution, and you can't go wrong with anything you order off the menu. lots of options for carnivores, omnivores, vegetarians and vegans. the MILF is always popular choice, but my favorite is the "going home for thanksgiving", which has turkey, cranberry, havarti and get this...SRIRACHA! ike himself told us the story of how one of the guys at the shop totally dismissed the idea of putting sriracha in a sandwich and making it taste good, but after eating it was summarily blown awaycouple of tips: bring a book or your smartphone cuz the line can take up to an hour, they gots some special sauce baked into the bread so don't even try re-creating any of these sammiches at home, and I usually buy 2-3 sandwiches at a time so I can eat 'em for lunch the next day
So, I found myself in the Castro today after a delicious mimosa brunch and beauty session with one of my fav's. After a long day drinking session and possibbly the world's worst haircut... I was STARVING. So.. on my trek back to pac hts I stumbled upon Ike's and my life will forever be changed. The staff was EXCEPTIONALLY friendly. When I finally decided what to order, it came out in far less than the 15 promised. (extra time for the salmon burger) So about 5 orgasmic bites of my sammy.. which i cannot recall the name of.. (salmon burger, avocado, grilled shrooms, provolone maybe) I realized the avocado was missing. It wasn't even necessary, but I went in and asked for a side just so I could get the full effect and they were almost apologetic to the point where I felt guilty for even mentioning it. They insisted on taking it back and adding the avo. I'm in awe with the customer service here. I feel guilty for not remembering the adorable boy's name behind the counter who referred to me by name everytime we interacted. Anyway.. Ike's.. I will be back, with every last one of my friend's.
Awesome....How many sandwich places can you get that have mozzarella sticks on them? Don't worry, there are healthier options as well.Gotten lunch here a few times, have yet to try a sandwich that wasn't amazing. *Tip on many days it's wise to call ahead (possibly 2-2 1/2 hrs) as the line can be down the block* Great value as well, I've never been disappointed.
I appreciate a lot of things about Ike's Place. I like the free chips--good quality chips, too--and the apple caramel pops slipped into the bag. I like the half whimsical, half legitimate soda offerings, especially the sarsaparilla. I like the t-shirts and the smiling, accommodating people who wear them.I don't like the wait. I'm not one of those Yelpers who came unprepared and feel that Ike's took my Saturday afternoon. However, I believe that a business should act to best serve its customers, and if I'm waiting in line for an hour, then 40 more minutes for my sandwich, something is wrong. There are certainly spacial constraints in Ike's Place, but there are also ways to streamline a process.In the end, it comes down to the food. The meatballs on my King Koopa were tasty and plentiful, flavored like the neighborhood Italian place back home. But the mozzarella sticks and jalapeno poppers didn't add anything but hype, and weren't crunchy, spicy or flavorful. My friend had the "Do you smell what Barack is cooking?" The ribeye was grey and dry, not the fresh cooked steak that could have been grilled in 40 minutes. The barbecue sauce was sweet and generic. I'm willing to wait for a table at a nice restaurant. I'm willing to eat while standing if the sandwich is from Gregoire's and my steak is hot and pink in the center. But after everything, the hype and the line, it was just a sandwich.
Great place for sammies. :)I had there meatless mike (vegan meatball sandwich), which was a good size portion, warm and very tasty! I also highly suggest the Nacho Girl, and I heard that the Nacho Boy and Fizzel was good too. Mmmm! Highly suggest the dutch crunch bread, crusty on the outside and soft in the middle, not like your usual hard as a rock/roof of your mouth cutting dutch crunch..love it! I also had their single serving of their baked fries/wedges, soooo yummy with their side of honey mustard sauce.... yum!! FYI: They do not serve there fries during the weekend due to the high volume of orders for sammies...sorry! I also highly suggest that you add pesto sauce with the dirty sauce (garlic aioli sauce). Parking, ehhh.. I could deal with.Ike states that "The chicken and the hot links are halal. I get the chicken through Restaurant Depot or Sysco Foods. The Hot Links are made at a Muslim butcher shop in the East Bay. The salami, pepperoni, ham, and meatballs at Ike's Place are pork free but are not halal. The bacon is the only meat that Ike's Place uses that is made from pork." Yay for Halal meats. Next time, I want to try either their seafood melt, flipper (tuna) or the salmon burger.
Great sandwiches... but is it ultimately worth the wait? Yesterday I finally got my hands on an Ike's Place sandwich after being thwarted on previous attempts. The primary obstacle is one of time... from placing the pickup-order via the phone to actually having the sandwiches in hand took two hours. It's faster if you place an in-store order, but then you are waiting in line for 30+ minutes.The sandwiches themselves were excellent. I ordered The Pizzle, #7 out of 188 meat sandwiches (to say nothing of the numerous and unnumbered veggi sandwiches). The Pizzle had moist and flavorful chicken, crispy bacon, and just enough ranch that I could taste it while not thinking I was ruining my "diet" (if I were on such a diet).But here's the rub. There's a sandwich place just down the street from my apartment that is easily on-par with Ike's which I reviewed earlier. It doesn't have quite the breadth of options, but personally I don't need 188 sandwiches, I just need one I really like (I'm not going out for sandwiches seven times a week here). The real difference is wait time, I can just pop in, grab my sandwich, and go. Ike's... not so much. Obviously location is everything here, and if you're in the Castro your not going to head out to Inner Sunset to "save time". But if your going destination shopping for a sandwich, there's no need to waste time standing in line at Ike's.
This is the burrito of sandwiches. Don't expect to finish it in one sitting. They have a wide variety of sandwiches but it's not one of those places where they put weird ingredients together just to be different -- they're actually good together.The line can get pretty insane on sunny days (I waited 45 minutes) so plan on hanging out for a while or call in your order and pick it up.
It's as good as you've heard. They don't even bake the *bread* for your sandwich until you order it, which is really a level of quality that I haven't seen anywhere else. And what other place will make a sandwich with *fresh* onion rings on it?It is slow. Do yourself a favor and call ahead. At the busiest times, expect a 40 minute wait. Fortunately I live 2 blocks away, so I call ahead every time. Saves a lot of hassle.Anyone dumb enough to write a 1-star review of this place just doesn't get it. If you want a fast sandwich, go someplace else. If you want a nice place to sit down and eat, go someplace else. If you want to ascend to sandwich heaven, go to Ike's. And if you want a sandwich with unusual ingredients, order one! They'll put jalapeo poppers on anything--pure awsome.
Spiffy Tiffy was really delicious. There was barely a line but they somehow lost our order and it ended up taking 40 minutes but we got a free soda to make up for it. The sandwiches are really god!!! There is very little seating inside and the lines can get long so I would recommend calling in your order on the phone so you can pick it up right when you get there.
I feel like I'm going to get bashed for this review but I'm sorry to say I didn't find the sandwich that amazing... *ducks and hides for cover*It was too wet and soggy to eat.My vote still lies with Marina Submarines..
Insanely good. Their menu changes, so be prepared. Also, be prepared for a line and a long wait to get your sandwich. I had the chicken with cesar dressing. It was really good, but had a bite of my friends "all meat" sandwich, and that really was the best sandwich I've ever had. Next time I'm getting that. Suggested for hangovers and just in dire need of a major sandwich. Take note, they are NOT cheap as sandwiches go, but they are worth it!
Just like the button says:I Like Ike!It's gonna take me a while to work my way through the menu, but I'll do it, 1 sandwich at a time. I've only been here a couple of times, but every time I go Ike knows me by name and makes me a piece of heaven.
I made my first visit to Ike's today after seeing the review of the day a few days back, and you should believe the hype. It's good. I love sandwiches, and I love creative sandwiches, Ike has got some crazy creative sandwiches, like 300 of them.Check our their menu on-line before going in, you'll save yourself time, and there are far more options listed on-line than there are on the wall inside. I had a Napoleon Complex, which wasn't listed and Ike seemed pretty impressed by my order. It was so big and so good, I love a good sandwich.It's a pretty small place, with a lot of die-hard fans. Ike, I think it's time to expand. That is probably the only drawback is that it is so cramped and popular.Finally, the cooks back there, HAWT. Nice eye-candy while you wait for your sandwich.
YUM NATION! The Meatless Mike rocked my tasted buds into the Matmos...I became animal-free one year ago and since then I've been craving a nasty ass Meatball Sub. Since then I've opted to make Veggie Sloppy Joes at home but don't quite hit the spot. Now enter Ike's place. Much like Tofutti's claim on their packages of cream cheese, "Better then Cream Cheese", this one certainly beats those old Meat Ball Subs I grew up with. "Better then Meat Ball Sub" Plus, The Sugar Beat Sweets Mini Cupcakes are Divine!
Off the top of my head, I cannot compare Ike's sandwiches to any else that I have ever had. The sandwiches I had tasted yesterday must have been the best sandwiches I have ever had.. dare I say it? IN THE WORLD. If I lived closer to the Castro, I would go to Ike's place everyday and have every sandwich on the menu. I calculated, if the total number of sandwiches was 200, if I had one three times a day, (breakfast, lunch, dinner) I would be able to try ALL the sandwiches in 66 full meals.. including a breakfast and a lunch. When I accomplish this feat, not only would I be a very happy person, but I may never need to eat another sandwich again in my life because nothing would compare to Ike's sandwiches. So my girlfriend and I tried the Mnage  trois and the BLT.. (by far the best BLT I have ever tasted) I had the Mnage  trois, it had chicken, honey, honey mustard, BBQ sauce, smoked gouda, jack cheese, Swiss cheese, and a large assortment of vegetables. A very tasty sandwich to say the least. The two sandwiches totaled to $18 and change, which was very decent because of the quality of the sandwiches.Also, Ike is a really nice guy, and personally handed us our sandwiches. We really liked that personal feel of service. I would HIGHLY recommend that you get a sandwich from Ike's Place, PICK one, ANY one. And I would bet my left hand that it will be a brilliant sandwich that you will crave for the rest of your life... that is.. until you get another one, then the cycle begins.
Very Very Very Yummy Sandwiches. Call ahead and order and they will be ready exactly when they tell you. Don't be late or else your bread will be soggy. The line is typically long so call ahead. Yummy!!! Awesome sandwiches!!! Perfect to grab a sandwich and head to Dolores park. Very cool friendly staff.
It's crazy cool how successful Ike's Place has become. I used to live two blocks away from Ike's and remember the first time I walked past his joint. Ike and a friend were sitting outside and asked (begged =P) me to try out a sandwich. I believe it was his 3rd or 4th day in business. I ordered a meatball sub and was blown away.  It's harder for me to go for my weekly fix now that I've moved, but it's cool to see that the customers are now the ones begging instead of Ike. =)
I will keep this short since there are already so many reviews. The sandwiches are as good as they say and it's most definitely worth the wait. I got the Kryptonite (shared with bf) - it was delicious! Go to Ike's...you won't regret it!
If you don't love this place, I don't like you, and we can't be friends. You'll get a lot of people here complaining about waiting in long lines and having no place to eat. When was the last time you chose a place to eat based on the quality of their tables? And the lines aren't about hype, these sandwiches are truly delicious. I love the Backstabber (and that in no way is representative of my personality. The vegetarian version is called the Brutus. I like to bring my picky-eater friends here. You might call them vegans.
Wow! Very impressive! I had the Mike's Meatless Meatball sandwich today, and I must say, it was the most amazing fake meat sandwich I have ever had in my life!!Bravo Ike!
I heard about this place referred to as "one of the top places you must eat before you die" and that couldn't be more true! Granted, it's not a place you go on your lunch break, but if you love sandwiches and are willing to make a thing of it, then this is the place to go. I had the "Not tonight I have a headache" and it was truly delicious. My conclusion about the line is this, if you're talking about how amazing a sandwich is for 2 hours after you've eaten it, then waiting in line for an hour isn't such a bad thing! The best part about this place is how friendly everyone is. When I got to the front of the line I was expecting some kind of sandwich nazi vibe... order and step aside, but that was not the case at all. Ike was patient, friendly and very helpful in answering any questions.I highly recommend this place to all foodies!
Oh... My... God... BEST SANDWICH EVAR! I usually hate it when friends over-hype something, whether it be food, movie, tv show, etc. If you don't think a sandwich from Ike's is one of the top 3 sandwiches you've ever had, then consider me guilty of over-hyping. I had the #59 (Cristina and Umair Go to Ike's Place), and it was so good, I could not eat it standing up. I had to sit down. I must have gone to this place when it was much less crowded (about 4pm on a Saturday afternoon), and I estimate that my wait in line was no more than a half-hour, and from the time I ordered my sandwich to the time it was ready was about 20 minutes. It sure did feel like a 2-hour wait, though.The verdict: ****** stars for the awesome sammich goodness (DIRTY SAUCE FTW!).-* star for the wait.Overall: Aww man... I guess I'll just have to give Ike's Place ***** stars.
The sandwiches are awesome. The wait to get them, not awesome at all. Called in our order well in advance, after being put on hold for 20 minutes we hung up and called again and had our order taken imediately. The guy on the phone told us that it would be 20 minutes. Showed up 20 minutes later to pick-up our sandwiches and they weren't ready yet. Stood around waiting for another 25 minutes while we watched at least 3 waves of people (non-pre phone orders) walk in, order thier sandwiches, get thier sandwiches, and walk out. Bullshit.
After hearing from a couple of friends that Ike's was getting evicted, I decided to try their sandwiches. Two of my other friends wanted to try Ike's as well and we all decided to call our orders in to avoid the long-ass lines people always associate with Ike's. Of course, both of my friends didn't want to actually call in so I was like, EVERYONE CHILL OUT, I GOT THIS! I actually messed up both of their orders but they were cool about it. We called in around 12 and our pick up time was 1:15. We arrived there on time and one of the workers there called me in to choose the complimentary chips and pay. She asked me if I wanted to buy a t-shirt or a sticker as a way to fundraise since Ike's was getting evicted. So I bought a sticker for $1. Not because Ike's was getting evicted, but because this girl had freckles. If I was a pokemon, my weakness would be freckles. Anyways, my sandwich, the name of girl I'm dating, was great. This sandwich is pretty filling, its loaded with chicken breast, avocado, jack cheese, dirty sauce and honey mustard sauce. All on a dutch crunch roll. My favorite part of the sandwich is the dutch crunch, if you're serious about eating a sandwich, you better do it right and get it on a dutch crunch roll. The reason why I gave it 4 stars is due to the wait. Even though we called in our order, we waited an extra 20 minutes to receive our sandwiches. Still, I definitely recommend this place especially if you've never been here.
Ike's is the BOMB. It's awesome. Last time I went I have the Tony Soprano. I'm not a risktaker when it comes to sandwiches, so I normally go for the turkey sandwich. I tend to get the italian sandwiches at other places to but that sandwich (Tony Soprano) was awesome. Will be going here again to try the Menage a Trois (I think that's how you spell it). :)
It's got mouth smackingly good sandwiches with awesome wait times. I once waited 2 hours.
I had wanted to try this place ever since seeing it on MVF. We were nearby and hungry so why not? It wasn't as busy as I thought it would be, so we ordered almost immediately. There were so many different options so we just went by the recommendations of the cashiers (who were very helpful). I went with Menage a Trois and decided to add jalapeno poppers to the sandwich. I ordered two sandwiches; one for me and one for my girlfriend, and the total came out to $28! $28 for two sandwiches. While it did include a bag of chips, I would hope for that price that it would come with a drink. So after paying I thought two things in my head; 1) this place must make a ton of money and 2) this sandwich better be good. 1) I'm pretty sure they do and 2) it was. I think what really made it good was their bread, the "Dutch Crunch." It was not too hard but was crispy enough to give the sandwich a bite. The halal chicken was tasty and the sauce really complemented the ingredients. I know my girlfriend wants to come back since she gave up meat for lent and went with something that had soy turkey that didn't taste that good to me.Again, I really enjoyed the sandwich but I wish they would offer more (make the sandwich bigger or add drink at least) to complete your meal. It's a good thing that I don't live nearby, otherwise I would probably be eating here more than I like and my stomach would big a lot bigger and my wallet a lot thinner.
Oh heck yeah baby!!!How often do you eat something and think about it every other minute for 2 days? Not very often I bet. Ike's is simply addicting. Not sure what he's putting in those things but I bet it's illegal!Want variety? Ike's has a ton of items to choose from. Including Vegan and Vegetarian crap if you're into it. Some of my Vegetarian friends say it's the best veggie stuff they've had in years. I had a 'meatless mike' sandwich. It was awesome for veggie. My favorite sandwich thus far is the 'Nacho Boy'. Be sure to get an order of 'guiltless fries' to go with your sandwich. I intend to try each sandwich. I will report back soon to let you know which other sandwiches I fall in love with.
One of the best sandwiches you will ever get in the city. Hot Mama Huda is my favorite!
YUM.Call your order in and pick it up. But, YUM.
It's not closed yet! They extended their stay for a bit longer so go grab as much as your heart can take of the greasy goodness!
Visiting from out of town...LunchSo I'm thinking after the lady mentioned this place to me...really?!?!...a sandwich place? but we are in san freakincisco...that's the best you can come up with. Again...I was thinking this and did not say this out loud. So we take a long taxi ride to another place in an area I would never of thought to come. We pull up and my first thought is how in the hell are we going to get a taxi after we are done eating, since it appeared to be in a residential area with very little traffic. Well too late to rethink ...since the taxi bolted as soon as he got his money. We walk in and my first comment was that there are no tables to sit and eat. This did not phase her. Either she did not hear me or she was ignoring me. I tend to go with the latter in this case...we were going to eat there...period. As we are looking at the menu on the wall, sandwiches made with halal chicken stood out. They had others but there seemed to be a theme here so I went with it. I also noticed a wall of chips and refrigerator case filled with a variety of unique drinks and sodas. I went with the Spiffy Tiffy and she had cheese steak. We both had it on their crunch bread. We grabbed our chips and soda and managed to find a spot on a bench up against the wall while we waited for our sandwiches. This was also going to be the place we end up eating once the sandwiches were ready. 10 minutes later we had our food.  Had to work through a little organization and positioning to make room for everything. Plus I did my best to ignore the various people who were hovering around waiting for their food, but were not as fortunate to get a seat. My sandwich was great! Loved the bread. The chicken with the pesto sauce, mushroom, guacamole, lettuce and tomato was simply amazing.  A Sasparilla with barbecue chips completed the meal. Chicken was tender and fresh tasting. She was in love with her cheese steak as well. This is a place to eat and leave or take it to go. Not a place to sit back and relax. However, it was a great food. My prayers to the Taxi G*d were also answered, since we were lucky enough to get a taxi in less than 3 minutes. WoooHooo.Suggestion...expand and/or make room for a few tables, even outside would be fine. Do you really need to take up a whole wall with boxes of chips? Just get a small shelf and restock. Turn the bench area into a table bar with high chairs. Move the recycling bins outside. Have people line up outside to wait to place food order like all the other fine food establishments (great free advertising). But still definitely worth 5 stars.
At the time of this review, there was 1097 reviews with a 4.5 star average. I guess you know that this is a good place, and that my review which follows will support this consensus. From service, to time, to options, to taste, to price, Ike's must be one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. I ordered #19, the Turkey and Cranberry sandwich. The gal asked if I liked spicy stuff, which I do. She then recommended adding siracha hot sauce and claimed it went well with the sweet cranberries. She was right. I had just downloaded a stop watch app, so thought I'd see how long it took these guys to come out with our order. There was a decent line, so I was thinking 10-15mins would be in range. It came out in about 8mins which we were blown away by. Hands down, a great sandwich place to go to. Eat it.
I'm a Capricorn with a Taurus rising and a Leo moon. I love predictability, routine, and friendly (but not intimate) social interactions. Taking that into consideration I was sent into a downward spiral of indecision when I set my eyes upon the menu here: 1,500 options. Thankfully the young woman that helped me was great in assisting me in narrowing down my choices. My sandwich was a perfect balance of salty, sweet, and savory. I will definitely be back. Oh - yes I did have to wait a bit for my sandwich. I don't mind that I waited because it was freshly cooked to order and delicious. Keep up the good work Ike's.
I love IKE's SANDWICHES. I will ALWAYS CALL IN the order before getting there to pick it up. That is the ONLY WAY to do it. Otherwise, you will be in line forever and sometimes there is nowhere to stand.
The sandwiches at Ike's are to die for. I can't tell if there's anything special about the ingredients...I'm certain they were fresh, and will rave about the delicious house-made bread forever...but that special Ike's sauce? Man...I can't think of anything more satisfying on a sandwich!Some folks have kavetched a bit about the wait. But Ike's has an order-ahead service, so if you don't want to wait, just pick up the phone and they'll tell you when it will be ready...no waiting, just walking over and picking it up!I think this is one of the best places to grab food on the go in the Castro. YUM!
WOW! What's the Big Deal??? That was what I wanted to know... seeing the line after a day in Dolores Park, we knew we had to check it out for ourselves. Glad we did, though it took 45 minutes, the sandwich and burger were amazing! Great bread and the Dirty sauce is a huge part of the WONDERFUL! Had the Al Bundy and burger w/bacon on sourdough-YUM! We will be back ! Ike actually handed us our order and interacted with the crowd/fans/patrons. Go to Ikes, plan on there being a line, mingle with your fellow folks as you enjoy the smell of Ike's and read over the menu!
So I guess I'm missing something here...It was very good, but I don't get the hype. Ike was not the nicest man I ever met. He actually said the sandwich I picked wasn't good...Ike "worst on the menu!" JR "Really, then why do you have it?"Ike "..."JR" It looks just like that one...without the dressing?"Ike"..."Soooooo, I give him 3.5 stars. He wasn't nice, but the worst sandwich on the menu was good as well as the others we ordered. The fries were also very good.I am not a huge fan of the wait but when you have a well rated Yelp business, I guess that's what you should expect!
Had my first sandwich from Ike's today. It was delicious. It was the Damn Straight - Chicken Breast, Marinara, Mozzarella Sticks, Provolone. insane to be eating mozz sticks in a sandwich. I love it.4 vs 5 stars because of 2 things: 1. I had tried to order the super mario but no meatballs. So sad as I was psyched for them. 2. When I went to pick up the sandwich the line was long and disorganized - after a bit they asked those who were just picking up (me included) to go up front and get our food. Yeehah.If they can figure out how to deal with the line better (have a pick up and an order line?) and keep the main ingredients in stock, I can see this rising to a 5 star review in the future. Also, if I had known in advance they had french fries, I would have ordered some. Ate the Damn Straight sandwich in Mission Delores Park and it was Damn Tasty!
This place is awesome. Great sandwiches. Great customer service. I didn't feel rushed and the lady who helped me decide was super nice. There are also cute boys who work here, so that's a huge plus. I wish they had a written menu of all the offered sandwiches though. Apparently they used to? I would definitely go back, even though their sandwiches are very messy to consume.
Good food. Terrible service. I ordered 2 sandwiches and waited over an hour to get them. Call in orders only
I have had food addictions in my life.For instance, I have needed- more than wanted- the peanut noodle bowl from Front Street Pasta in Missoula. (Sprinkled with crack.)I have woken up in the middle of the night dreaming of the YikYak salad at the Buckhorn. (Sprinkled with crack.)I have driven across town for an order of Lodgepoles at McKenzie River Pizza when there were three pizzerias within a block radius. (Sprinkled with crack.)However, I have never wanted to seek down addresses, find abodes, and throw pebbles at windows of abodes until said sandwich-master Ike wakes from a sound sleep to craft me the one thing I CANNOT be happy without, a vegan Napoleon Complex on Dutch with Dirty.  (Sprinkled with love, honesty, kindness, smiles, bear hugs, and good juju.)Thank you Ike, for turning me into a monster.
Yes, the wait is terrible. But it's great people-watching, and the sandwiches are awesome. I had the 23 (Montana to Rice) which was meatballs, marinara and pepperjack cheese, and it made me super-happy. My husband got the Say Hey, which was pastrami and some other stuff and he loved his as well. Next time we're in town, we'll go again, but this time I will try to go WAY in advance of actual hunger, since I know now that I will likely be standing around on the sidewalk outside of Ike's waiting for ages for my delicious lunch....
Just a really well made sandwich with the just the right consistency of bread and balance of ingredients in the Lincecum. If there is one criticism of this place it would be the ridiculous wait, even after ordering the sandwich. If you are super hungry and not a very patient person you are liable to go ballistic. I probably would have to try several other of their sandwiches to get a better appreciation of the place although my favorites in SF still remain the Deli Board's boca and the prochetta sandwich from Roli Roti.
I love ike's! You can't beat the 16th and mission except maybe the ex-girlfriend.
Amazing, thorough customer service! They were so on the ball and efficient it was sick. The sandwich was really good and interesting in a good way. I will definitely go back, grab it to go (call it in beforehand) and take my Ike's to a park.
Ike's place is the bomb! I tried numerous sandwiches from here and they all taste amazing. The cashiers are always friendly and welcoming so the small space does not bother me too much. The only reason I took 1 star off is that it is a bit pricey for some normal size sandwiches but I guess you pay for quality
I have never experienced a sandwich like I have at Ike's. Ventured down last weekend with some friends, braved the wait and enjoyed every minute of it. I order the Matt Cain....roast beef, turkey, salami and godfather sauce on dutch crunch (of course). Walked a few blocks to Dolores park and nommed in silence with my friends. Finished it all over with the apple lollipop, followed by a serious food coma. LOVE LOVE LOVE.
Loved the Matt Cain!
Ikes is awesome, wish they had indoor seating so I could eat there more often, its all about the bread and TONS of choices. I'd reccomend getting the Hollywood SF Cheesesteak Sandwich but don't get it on the Dutch Crunch bread, it gets too heavy and too rich and you'll have a food coma for 2 days. Also huge props for the GREAT service, they'll help you pick out a sandwhich and they people there are super cool.
Sandwiches are above par but not near enough above to wait 40 minutes for one. If you can get there early, go for it, especially given a lack of good options in the Castro.
Never had a sandwich drip so much juice out onto my hands on the first bite. I'm a huge believer in moist sandwiches, or in all foods in general. I used to date someone who liked dry chicken, go figure. Ike's is delicious, has a vast menu for every kind of personality, and is close to my apartment. Dont wear nice clothes to eat Ike's. It will explode onto your stilettos or Puma's. But in case you didn't listen to my advice and did anyway, i'm sure it was still worth it.I recommend calling in your orders before you arrive. Save yourself the wait.
Holy crap Ike. I just ate 1.5 sandwiches (ahh the benefits of having a gf with a small appetite) from your joint and I am more than impressed. I'm even more excited that you have so much stuff to choose from because I'm going to be back to try everything This being the first time I've eaten here I seriously went back and forth on 4-5 different wiches. Your Yelp rating is well deserved and keep up the good work.Mozzarella sticks IN a sandwich?!?!?! Pure genius. Dirty sauce should be a table top condiment everywhere you go. Maybe I'll buy a bottle and stash it in my gf's purse.
Based on the yelp reviews, I had to try Ike's sandwich so I dragged my friend with me and drove from the Sunset to the Castro one Saturday afternoon.Here's why I don't get the hype:1. 50 minutes for 2 simple sandwiches2. No parking!3. ran out of the much raved about air fries4. messed up order i.e.I ordered 16th and market with the works and dirty sauce....it was missing the tomatoes, pickles, and dirty sauce 5. hearty....good amount of meat but nothing special
i always compare sandwiches to ike's and little luccas but i realized.... I NEVER WROTE A REVIEW ON IT! wtf was i thinking eh!?of course im not going to wow people with something they don't already know. this is the best damn sandwich place in the bay are. heck.... they have the best damn sandwiches i've ever tasted! im so glad i work in the castro....i get to feast on this shiet allll the time. (not that i do.... im not THAT much of a fetty!)
OK so I'm from So cal and around here that means you're an idiot, which is cool I get it. I do know something, I can't be that stupid if I found Ike's in my first month here. This place is dynamite!! I can't say which sandwich is my favorite yet, but I've had two and they both were damn good!!! I had the Hollywood SF Cheesteak and the King Koopa and loved them (I would have to lean towards the cheesteak though).  The service is great and will help clear up the menu if you get lost and you probably will. The only bad thing is there might not be a seat or a parking, but you get a lollipop with your order. Oh yeah and here's something I've never heard of, but dutch crunch bread is pretty good!
Warning: Do not order the Montana to Rice meatball sandwich if (a) you haven't secured a table outside the store, (b) it's windy and you have hair, and/or (c) you forgot to bring along your butcher's rubber apron and shower cap. This is the messiest thing I've ever eaten in my whole life. It looks like a massive amount of food, but half of it ends up smeared all over your hands, arms, face, and head, so you really aren't ingesting that many calories. And you really want to be close to Ike's bathroom after you're done, so you can give yourself a sponge bath--unless you don't mind walking around town looking like Jeff Goldblum toward the end of the movie "The Fly."I think the problem is the dirty sauce, which is really quite soupy, or ended up that consistency after mixing with the marinara sauce and the sliced tomatoes. So with every bite, you've got creamy globs of lettuce and other fillings oozing and spurting all over the table--hence the reason you need a table. I had a good laugh over the two paper napkins that came with my brown-bagged sandwich. Yeah, right. And don't even think about trying to take this home or bring it somewhere for a pretty little picnic. It's going to be exploded pink mush by the time you get anywhere--unless you live on the same block as Ike's...maybe. Now the negatives: the sandwich was just okay. Not bad-tasting, by any means, but not terribly memorable or something I need to eat again. Couldn't even taste the cheese, since there was so much other crap going on in there. And seriously, why do the sandwiches need to be that enormous? I'd happily have ordered half of one and paid half the price. Happy discovery: pickles and meatballs make a very nice combination.
Both times my friends brought over a sandwich for me to eat during my lunch break (thanks buddies!). These sandwiches are flavorful and there are vast selections. I have to admit though, the first sandwich didn't jump out at me like I expected. I had the Say Hey Kid and I wouldn't say it stood above all other pastrami sandwiches I've had, but it was definitely good. I guess with the 4 1/2 stars, I was thinking it would be out of this world. But maybe I just had the wrong expectations because it was no doubt a solid pastrami sandwich.The second time around I decided the go for something more unique. The We're Just Friends has the tasty halal chicken breast with orange glaze sauce and avocado. Mmmmmm that's more like it, a sandwich unlike any other sandwich I've had. The ingredients worked so well together.With such a variety of sandwiches from unique to classic, the place has something for everyone. It also gives me the option of when I want to try something new or when I'm just in the mood for something familiar. A typical pastrami is done very well, and a 'different' type of sandwich such as chicken with orange glaze sauce is new and refreshing. I know I'd want more Ike's just to try out the other sandwiches. And by the time I try all the ones I want to try (if I ever do), I'd probably want to go back to the ones I liked and get them again!Oh yeah, the bread is really good. The dutch crunch's texture is near perfect. I think they don't bake it until the order is made has something to do with it.
I don't know what y'all are complaining about lines and such...Wednesday 12:00 sharp 5 minutes from order to first bite.And...what's up with the 5 chairs? 4 stars. Some people enjoy the whole hole in the wall local feel where they have to fight over crowds and stand to eat. Call me old-fashioned, but I like to slide my ass way forward in my chair and lounge.
I like my sandwiches really plain. Just turkey, lettuce, and cucumbers. No cheese, no mayo, no mustard, and no "special" sauces. What can I say - I am not a condiment girl. I took a friend to Ike's because we had both read such great things about it, and he was really excited to try a sandwich. Despite the good reviews, I was a little worried about going to a sandwich shop that was known for a "dirty" sauce and a million different ingredients. I put my worries aside and took a walk to Ike's. Ike's Place is small, but don't worry about finding it because the signage is large and it is the only place on the street with people waiting outside. My friend ordered his sandwich (menage a trois) and I stepped up to order mine. I was really worried that these guys could get my sandwich right since I was ordering it plain. The guy behind the counter gave me a playful hard time and yelled to the sandwich makers to make mine with "extra dirty sauce." Our sandwiches came out about 10 minutes later delivered by Ike himself. All the ingredients are of great quality - no scary processed meats here. I ordered mine on a dutch crunch roll and it was sooo good. It came out all toasted and crunchy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. But the best part - they actually got my sandwich right! My friend was thrilled with his sandwich. I'm talking eyes glazed over and full on blissed-out while eating it. His sandwich was chicken, bbq sauce, real honey, and jack cheese. He ordered it on the recommendation of the guys who work there - they said it was their favorite. Well they did not lie, because my friend said it was the best sandwich he had ever had. Ike came back a couple of minutes later to see how we were doing, pretty good service for a sandwich shop! The sandwiches are huge and messy. You will not go hungry eating here. All sandwiches are served with a lolly pop (either tootsie or caramel apple), which is a nice touch. The staff is super friendly and really nice - the kind of nice that you can't fake because it comes from people who actually love their job and what they do. Most people say I like boring sandwiches, and I guess I do, but my sandwich at Ike's was delicious and served with a smile (and a lolly pop).
Ok, I had my number 9 (add peppers) again. Turned our Son and Daughter in law on to the same thing and easily found the NEW PLACE - right across the street from the original, sorta.There were NO tables. Only chairs. WTF? Ike, it's not that difficult. Review my previous post please - sigh.Sandwich was great as always.
Mnage a Trois! Best sandwich I've ever had. Will return for sure
Its a good thing I don't live in San Francisco. If I did, I'd be a regular here and I'm sure it would affect my waist line. The sandwich was delicious.I had the #55 Lincecum - Ham, Turkey, Bacon, Avocado, Havarti on a Dutch Crunch. The Dutch Crunch bread is warm, buttery and the Dirty Sauce is nothing but goodness.The menu is a bit overwhelming, but if you focus on the ingredients, it will make sense. I'll be back. Next time I'll try something more adventurous.
Have you ever wondered why there is a hoard of people standing just off of the corner of 16th and Sanchez?Ike's is pretty much the best place to snag a tasty sandwich, no matter what you're craving (almost)...Once Ike starts rocking tempeh, (and a few hundred more sandwich options) he'll really blow all competition away. But for now, his sandwiches are pretty damn good as it is.Whether it's a 15minute wait or over an hour, it's completely worth it.[edit: 2010, last time I called on a weekday asking for two sandwiches the wait was only 3 short hours. I opted to make my own killer sandwiches instead. I guess it's about time I challenge Ike to a sandwich-off]Big ups to Huda, Quetzal and others for always making a trip to Ike's that much more pleasurable... (Ike included of course)If I know anyone in search of a damn good sandwich, Ike's Place is the first suggestion to come out of my mouth.All we need is an Ike's Place 3...maybe and Ike's Place 2and the world will be a better place.
I miss East Coast delis where you could walk in, order a hot pastrami sandwich, select a pickle, and be on your way.Is it really too much to ask that a short order cook take short orders?Effing California yuppies with your blackberrys and your appointment-only sandwiches. I hate you.----------EDIT: Wow, I'm sorry if I offended you. I know you can't help it:stuffwhitepeoplelike.com
Highly recommended. I visit this place whenever a friend from out of town comes over to the bay area and they always leave impressed with Ike's awesome sandwiched.The cheapest bang for you buck in San Francisco. Great service and super awesome food.
They get it right every time! So much creativity and love goes into every sandwich and service is always top notch. Though a little pricey for a deli, worth every penny for the quality. A very welcomed addition to our city.
I have to echo everyone else's sentiment and agree that this place is amazingly tasty. The dirty sauce is so yummy, I want a jar of it to spread on everything! My dining partner ordered the Barack (perfectly seasoned and tender rib eye) and I had the pastrami, both so delicious! I had a hard time deciding what to order, I want to go back and try many more combos! We went during an off peak hour so the wait was not too bad, but from what I understand, the lines do get very long. I though the lollipops were a nice touch. But when I finished my sandwich I wanted to go back for another one, not eat a lollipop! :)
This place is good. Really good. I must say I eat a lot of sandwiches, and the best thing about Ike's is that they have something for everyone. You don't have to like turkey or ham or roast beef w/ lettuce or tomato or pickles or onions, because they are much more than that. It seems like dozens of different options for someone to pick from on the menu.I actually had the MILF, which turned out to be splendidly delicious but gave me food coma for like 3 hours. Halal (shredded) chicken w/ Frank's Red Hot, ranch dressing, stuffed jalepenos, sharp cheddar on Dutch Crunch. It weighed like 2 lbs. despite being only like 8 inches long. I usually eat 2 footlongs but I was pretty full after only half a sandwich. Oh yea, and the hot sauce / ranch combination is quite messy (but really good). Probably wouldn't order this one if I was on a date...Anyways, this is a must try for sandwiches. I heard it gets really busy so calling ahead can help. Mmm...
I thought this place was overhyped and would not live up to all the great reviews. I was totally wrong. The minute I took a bite I knew this was the best sandwich in SF. I love the fresh sourdough bread. They also have excellent customer service. Ike and his mom were both really nice to my wife who picked up our sandwiches.BTW - When you order a sandwich they give you a time to come in and pick it up. When you get there they call your name and you pay, no line!! I love it.Only problem is trying to park around there. What a hassle. Everyone was double parked like me causing a total clusterf#@k once we got our sandwiches and wanted to leave.
WOW. YUMMY!!! came here for the first time with my boyfriend last week and we were not disappointed. I am coming back to try out other sandwiches! The line wasn't super duper long, but it was like 2pm when i went. I wish the road construction will end soon so the street won't be so dusty and dirty. I probably wouldn't even bother eating outside because there aren't enough seats. So I drove back home to enjoy our sandwiches. I feel it is a bit pricey, but since it was so yummy, it is well worth it!
When Ike's first opened - I did not think he would last long. Not because of his food, but because that particular part of the block does not get much traffic. The businesses that occupied that spot always closed within a few months... So after having my first sandwich, I was excited and really hoped he would make it. The sandwiches were great - but the service was slow. It was his first week and it was pleasant outside - so I didn't let it phase me. I ate here a couple more times and still loved the sandwiches - Ike always asked if there was anything more he could to to make the sandwhich excellent! never expected this question from a sandwich place so I was caught off guard a the first couple of times... and to be honest made me feel a little uncomfortable for reasons I can't really explain.Anyway.. I was craving Ike's again and walked by and saw the sign By Appointment Only!!! Like the other yelpers I thought this surely must be a joke... Ike looks like a guy who would have this sense of humor... but as it turns out this was no joke. Unfortunately I will never eat at Ike's again. Honestly your sandwiches are good but they are not by appointment only good. If the crowds are too much - just means you need better help making those sandwiches.
Itsa mystry, Ike is a sammie god. Like his shop needs another review....hmmmm ... but I cannot resist. Great sandwiches great service. Not a personal review of my past or children. But just really ... check this joint out. Not without the challenges of parking and lines etc. but well worth the Castro challenges..... itsa place you will visit again and again for the best sandwich, the best service...
The best sandwich I've ever had!! I ordered the Change - some thinly sliced ribeye steak, beer battered onion rings, BBQ sauce and smoked Gouda on the delicious dutch crunch bread. The wait was worth every minute!When my order was up, I had to hold myself back from immediately tearing into it. Nice and toasty, the bag warmed my hands as this delicate BBQ smell started to make it's way to my nose. Why did we park so far away! As soon as we made it to the car, I couldn't wait any longer and finally gave in to my roaring stomach. Bite #1 - AMAZING!Bite #2 - I think I'm in love!Bite #3- How can a sandwich be this good?! And why did it take me this long to find them!On a side note, I don't recommend eating these sandwiches while driving. Thankfully I was the passenger, but it was a true challenge eating it without getting it all over myself.
MANAGE A TROIS? 3 SUM? 3 WAY? NO THANK YOU! I want this sandwich alllll to myself ! We made an order to be picked up by 6pm before battle of the bay. We got here 20 minutes early and found that our sandwiches wouldn't be ready for another 20 minutes. I was irked that I had to wait, but happy that our sandwiches would be freshly made. What we ordered: Manage a trois- halal chicken breast, real honey, honey mustard, bbq, pepperjack, swiss, and gouda, 'as it.' OH MY GOUDA, was this sandwich the best I've ever had. Everything about this sandwich was absolute deliciousness. I'm pretty sure Dung N. would love this as well, meaty bbq goodness =). The pizzle- halal chicken breast, bacon, ranch, and cheddar. The S.O loved this sandwich, "hella good," he says. We're just friends- halal chicken breast, sweet orange glaze, avocado, and pepperjack. Only had a bite of this sandwich and it was pretty tasty, the person that ordered this managed to finish the entire sandwich. Nacho boy- hot roast beef, mushrooms, avocado, and swiss cheese. Didn't get a chance to try this sandwich, but the person that ordered this sandwich has had this two or three times already. Goes to show how tasty this sandwich must be if its worth ordering over and over again! I will definitely be visiting Ike's again whenever I'm in the city. I don't know if I'll ever order anything else besides the 'Manage a Trois', how can any sandwich ever top it? I don't care to find out. ++ Funky fusion chips are damn tasty too!
Well, I think this place is just average Sub place. I am East bay certified Gateau. I've experienced much better than this. and i live in SBC(San Bruno City). We have tons of better place than this. I've also heard that they have more than 50 different types of Sandwiches, which is annoying. I think this place is famous and people waiting more that 2hours sometimes on weekend, because it is in Castro. People don't eat in Castro. yeah. that is what it is. Ummhh
Wow finally found a great sandwich shop walking distance from the Mission. I had a tasty meatball sandwich today. There's lots of variety on the menu. Love the fact they toast the bread/roll. That spread seems like it might be the secret ingredient to a killer sandwich, if I were an addict I found my drug!!!Just wish they had a carry out menu, so I knew what I could order for the next time.
Best sandwiches I have ever had...I was excited to try Ike's after hearing that they had an entirely separate vegan menu. I live in Oakland, so I thought that it was a little overkill to trek all the way to San Francisco just for a sandwich, but I have traveled much further for vegan food before.I liked the enthusiasm and friendly attitude of the staff immediately. The shop was very busy, but everyone was clearly working with a sense of urgency. I was impressed by the ability of the 4 or 5 staff members to work that quickly in such close quarters, especially with the added pressure of having a line of customers out the door. After I asked for the vegan menu, I received a VERY enthusiastic recommendation to try the vegan Backstabber (vegan turkey, marinated artichoke hearts, Dirty Sauce, soy cheese). I opted for the Meatless Mike (vegan meatballs, marinara, soy mozzarella) and my friend ordered the Backstabber. Both sandwiches were phenomenal. The keys are the Dirty Sauce (a garlic and herb mayo concoction) and the breads being toasted to perfection. I was literally dumbstruck while eating, wondering how a sandwich could be so good.I disliked... NOTHING! I don't care that there is no seating inside or that the delicious sandwiches take a few minutes longer than expected to wind up in my hands and mouth. I'd gladly wait an hour for one and eat it standing.Bottom line... I make the journey to Ike's at least once a week, even though there are plenty of places to get a vegan sandwich in the East Bay. It is worth the trip, the extra couple of bucks for BART, and the sometimes longer-than-average wait. I am also supremely jealous of the non-vegans who can get such creations as the Super Mario (all beef meatballs, marinara, mozzarella sticks, pepper jack). Do yourself a favor and check Ike's Place out, especially if you are vegan or vegetarian.
I hate to rain on your love-fest parade, but you lost me with "by appointment only." I respect that you probably didn't plan to be so popular...or be a little yelp phenom, but seriously, when I went to you and was 2nd in line one morning and my sandwich still took 45 minutes...that's just ridiculous.I'm sure anyone can make a sandwich delicious if they slather it with garlicky mayo, to boot.so your bread is good, and the free sucker is a nice touch...but i can't remember when i've had such poor quality roast beef.bah!
This place is the $hit! Love it so much! Waited an hour for my sandwich, but totally worth it. Ordered the Nacho Boy on Sourdough and boy, it was pure heavenly bliss. YUM! Gotta try the dirty sauce next time...Definitely bring a friend to keep you company during the long wait. Or make a friend by taking to the other customers. Very cute Workers too! ;)
3 words to describes Ikes....Variety, variety...and did I mention Variety?? They have an extensive menu, of very creative sandwiches. If you can't find something delicious on this menu you're on crack! I said it, crack! I love their sandwiches, but I think I love the fact that when i order my sandwich I get to order myself some Matt Cain even more...MMMMm, mmm baby!!! Of coarse the BF loves it too, he orders the Mona je trois...the looks BF's give their girlfriends when they think they're being funny, LOL. Either way, they moved locations, just down the street from their previous one, they're staff is really friendly, they're ingredients are fresh, and they have bread options....very important when ordering a sandwich. I'd have to say, that Ike's takes a very close second behind Roxies.
Hands down one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. I got the Super Luigi (not on the menu). It's basically the Super Mario with jalapeno poppers instead of mozzarella sticks. If you go on the weekend ORDER BY PHONE or you will end up waiting in line for hours. The wait is still the same for the phone, but at least you can do other things while you wait. I recommend going on their website ahead of time, to choose your sandwich. (ilikeikesplace.com/menu). You can click on the sandwiches and it will show you a picture. Very helpful
Best sandwich I've ever had! I had the Nacho girl on their famous Dutch Crunch bread and all I can say is WOW!
First time to enjoy the Elvis Keith, I AM HOOKED!!!! In a word, DELISH!!!!
Unreal. If you're reading this review to see if you might go there....just stop reading and go already. One of the best sando's I've ever had in my life, period. Not for the faint of heart though, they are gnarly and loaded with calories.
Ike's makes great sandwiches...just read all the reviews. My favorite part is after I finish my sandwich I have a yummy lollipop to enjoy. The caramel apple lollipop is my favorite, cotton candy lollipop is good too. Too bad it is not closer to my work. But maybe it is better than way...I don't need to eat such a big sandwich and cannot afford to spend $10 (and up) on just a sandwich and soda on a daily basis.
The Joker was amazing, great combination of flavors and tender meatballs. After splitting that with my bf, we were stuffed but we still tried the Damon Bruce - maybe because the joker was so amazing, the rib-eye couldn't compare. I do recommend everyone to go on the website to choose their sandwich and remember which ones you want first because they don't have a full menu for you. Good thing we remembered which ones we wanted or we'd be stuck with the few that were on their board. The voodoo chips were yummy, the salt and pepper way too spicy - perfect for the ones who love peppery chips. With the order of a pop to go with two sandwiches and two bags of chips, it came up to around $30 and that's way too expensive and too far to go for sandwiches. If in the area- it is worth trying.
So many people have been yelping about it, I got a friend to go with me so we could see what all the fuss was about. I walked 10 blocks against the wind only to run into two friends coming down 16th street asking where i was going, 'i'm going to try out that ike's sandwich shop, have you ever been?' they of course had heard about it too, and were easily swayed in joining us. we got to the door around 4:30 (on a saturday) to read 'sorry, but on saturday and sunday it is so busy that we make sandwiches by APPOINTMENT ONLY.'I figured this must be a joke. who makes an appointment to eat a sandwich?apparently people do. and considering that there was no line and no one eating in the place, we were still turned away because we did not have said appointment, they really honor their appointment making system. 'how about a sandwich to go?' to which i still received the same response: 'no.'I would make an appointment to go see my doctor, I make an appointment to get my haircut, and I even make an appointment to get a massage-- these are personalized services where I have received personal care and treatment that keeps me coming back. But, to make an appointment for a sandwich? I dont want to knock the wonderful skill and attention and preparation that people have in the food industry. but this is not french laundry where you make an appointment months in advance to eat a full course meal with lots of friends on a fixed price menu. sandwiches are supposed to be non-committal. i'm walking to dolores park and i spontaneously think that i want a sandwich, so i walk to the store and get one. this is how the interaction is done.a good business is popular, but a good business deals with the crowd, gets the product to the people. part of the allure is the crowd, the wait, the anticipation. i went to birite creamery instead and stood in a line that wrapped down along 18th street. the whole time i was thinking i was crazy for waiting a half hour for a scoop of ice cream. sure it was annoying to wait that long and crowded, but in the end i got my ice cream cone and it was deliciously worth the 30 minute wait.that said. i will NEVER ever make an appointment to get a sandwich. I would much rather walk down the block the the million other sandwich shops that will make me what i want when i want it.
K. I don't know what to say that hasn't been said. I feel that after so many reviews, mine might be just white noise, so I'm gonna keep it short. THIS WAS THE BEST SANDWICH I HAVE EVER HAD..........EVER!!!!!!!!! Hot, flavorful, unique and amazing. The line was worth it. Fighting for parking was worth it. Toll was worth it. I would walk across the Bay Bridge for this sandwich.
Ok. I'll get straight to the point. A co-worker volunteered to get us sandwiches from this place. I ordered a #25. At first glance at the sandwich it looks small and doesn't look like it can satisfy your average lunch appetite. The sandwich did that for me and I still wasn't hungry by the time dinner came around. On top of that, it tastes great. It's that satisfying for me. And I didn't have to buy a bag of chips or something. It's not something healthy as Subway, but I'll gladly pay the price for another sandwich at this place.
I'm actually a little torn between 4 and 5 stars on Ike's. I found the restaurant's size and the service to be the weak points, but it's hard to complain about a sandwich that good for that price. Great place!Food - Well above averageValue - Well above averageService - Slightly above averageMenu Options - Well above average.
My coworker just bought 10 sandwiches or so for my office. I didn't get to see what everyone ordered since they were wrapped up.But I got a turkey/avocado hot sandwich with all the fixings. I didn't know it was going to be hot and it was delicious! Next time I go I'll have to check out all these different ones everyone is talking about. I didn't realize my coworker was ordering from the best place ever for a sandwich!
I have to say that the place gets so much business from the hype from yelp and from the Man vs. Food episode. I finally gave in and tried this sandwich shop and I truly have to say that I am not that impressed, especially when I have to wait more than 1 hour for a sandwich. I ordered the backstabber and my friend ordered a Shawn Michaels. We get to the line at 1 PM (which is pretty late for lunch already). We did not order until 1:50 PM. Then, we wait for the food and finally get our sandwiches at 2:15 PM. Overpriced, overhyped, and took way too long! Next time, I'm going to Lucca's.
Ike's is a big SO-SO. I don't really care for the veggies at this place: they love their iceberg lettuce and tomatoes. But why stop there? The sauce that was put on my sandwich was tasty. I'll give Ike a star for that. But the tastiness of one's condiment is but one thing that makes a sandwich good. Ike charges roughly 6-8 bucks for a sandwich. That's a lot. Perhaps one is paying for overhead costs or perhaps Ike's prices are inflated for mere profit. Whatever the case, I don't think the sandwiches alone warrant these prices.I ain't going back.
Love Ike's. the Lincecum is perfect for someone who likes avacado.
Amazing, delicious sandwich! I had the Ben Afflec. Mmmm. And the prices are great!One word of caution though... it took 45 minutes to get said sandwich.  They are popular! I live on the same block as Ike's and the line is insane on the weekends. If you want to try this wonderful sandwich spot, go during the week or order ahead and pick up. Super staff too - they're all really fun and friendly!
WOW! We came here on a Monday afternoon around 2 and the line was crazy long... we waited for about a half hour before even ordering and then another 15 minutes for our sandwiches. We came all the way from the east bay just to try it. There's no seating so we ended up eating in our car. TIP: If you are coming here you should call ahead and order your sandwiches because you get to cut in line and get your sandwich right away. I had the Jerie's BIG Meat Sandwich, it was definitely BIG MEAT... there was Roast Beef, Pastrami, Turkey, Ham, Salami, with jack on a dutch crunch... it was stacked with all the fixins and huge. There are a lot of different sandwiches to choose from. Will come back and try more, but will call first.
Awesome sandwiches. The line may take forever but in the end it is worth it for a yummy sandwich. I think we waited for about 30 min total. 15 to get to the head of the line and then another 15 for the sandwiches. We didn't know you could call ahead and order your sandwiches, but now we do. I had the Eli Manning -Halal Chicken Breast, Zesty Garlic and Herb Sauce, Mushrooms, Avocado, Cheddar on dutch crunch... a little pricey for a sandwich but definitely worth it!
Everything you've heard is true. This place is ridiculous.Love Ike; Sandwich Master without peer.Love Yael; sweetest, friendliest Sandwich Mistress on the planet.Love the vibe; and the easy peasy chill outside tables.Love the customers; instant friends, communing in the radiance of Ike's creations.But my true love is the tasty, juicy, can't-stop-eating-them sandies.Thanks Ike.
I Heard about you on Best of the Bay Tv & Man VS. Food, looking forward to trying one of your sandwiches! ahahaI heard phone in orders are best vs. waiting 2 hours in line..
Everyone else has said it so I guess I'll say it again.Best damn sandwich shop in town.Best times to come without having to phone in an order?Weekdays before lunchtime, or weekdays after lunchtime and before dinner time.So far I've tried:Hollywood's SF Cheesesteak - Meaty good!Name of the Girl I'm Dating - Swt Chicken goodness.MILF - Ok, overwhelming hot sauce, didn't taste anything else really.Menage-a-Trois - Beautifully done sandwich.Kryptonite - Ginormous, come with an appetite for this.So much more combinations to try, so little time!
Holy frick! These sandwiches are fricking amazing! What is it that puts these sandwiches in a league of their own? It's got to be that "dirty sauce" stuff. I usually eat all sandwiches free of saucy condiments like mustard or mayo (I dislike mayo with a glaring passion), but opted to keep Ike's special dirty sauce on my sandwich based a friend's recommendation. Dirty sauce doesn't taste like mayo at all. What the frick is it? Oh, I don't care. All I know is that It is something glorious, something that makes Ike's sandwiches amazingly delicious. I've had the:Nacho Boy, Name of Girl I'm Dating, and Menage a Trois--all three were deliciousness. Sandwiches (and the lollipop) are well worth the wait. Ike even gave us two lollipops when my friend and I told him we were splitting the sammie. How sweet (:
Awesome sandwich!!! The only let down was that there was no seating. I went to Dolores Park a few blocks away and watched all the dog lovers mingle and was treated to a cool drum circle of granola peeps nearby. The double crunch bread was awesome. A nice selection of veggie friendly options. Also, the cute brunette taking orders was efficient, smiling, and friendly. I would hire her in a hearbeat! The real appeal of this place is the fact that you can add all sorts of stuff on your sandwich like onion rings, friend zucchini, and their badass sauce. Beware, my friends say it can be up to an hour wait during peak times! Well worth it during my stay in the city.
SPEECHLESS!!!! today was my first time i went to ike's and i ordered a nacho boy. by the way i'm sick and i can't smell or taste much. but once i took one bite of that sandwich my eyes just closed for a few seconds to enjoy that flavor. my taste buds were in some kind of euphoria and my mouth was orgasming crazily. BEST FUCKING SANDWICH I EVER HAD!!!!!when you close your eyes for a few second to savor that great taste... thats when you know its GOOD
Never one to walk in to a restaurant/eatery without first scoping out the goods online, I thought I knew what I wanted."16th and Market, Please."The cashier girl, really sweet and cute-looking especially with her glasses (were there glasses? My memory is starting to fog, like after a hard night of drinking), gave me a look, then said, "You've never been here before, have you."What gave it away? I guess it was my order "There are other sandwiches you should order. You wanted chicken?"I hesitated. Actually, I wanted a gigantic red-meat sandwich dripping with cheese and fat but we're making 4 racks of lamb tonight so I'm saving myself for that. "Sure. Whatever is good."I ended up getting the Backstabber. It had my favorite component, aritchoke hearts, which is rare in sandwiches. In fact, it is rare anywhere. Maybe it has become too plebian for SF. This was my sandwich. It spoke to me. I asked for the ceasar dressing on the side because I'm afraid of dressing but didn't want to miss out on the whole experience, taste-wise.The sun was shining, people were waiting, patiently, the table were full. These two asian girls got their order and vacated the 3 seat right outside. I sat down and waited for my order. And waited. And listened to the people around talk about the line, about this place, about life. A pair of blokes in front of me were trying this place for the first time too. I wonder if they're going to yelp about it too. They sat at the other outside seating, next to the street, in the warm sun.Inside, this beautiful lady with tattoos all up and down her arms was talking very very animately to a guy wearing a vintage coat with ragged hems. Not the standard hand flapping, foot tapping, this lady was about to stand up several times to make her point. She used her entire upper body to talk. It was so engaging, the guy stepped out of line to let her finish her story, then got back in it 20 mins later. It must have been good.Now, for the sandwich. Where do I begin? The appearance was beautiful. There was the perfect ratio of meat, veg, filling, bread. None of the components overpowered each other visually, it was like a layered cake. The chicken was shredded and flavorful. It wasn't dry and it wasn't soggy. How do they do it? There is something in their dirty sauce that made me cry with joy a little. An herb or some kind of seasoning that rang so true, I had to stop mid chew and savor that flavor. It is enhanced by breathing in through the nose, then gently exhaling through the mouth. Like a fragrant color, it was fleeting but full-bodied.After I ate the whole thing (dipping a little in the ceasar dressing, yes it made it more scrumptious), I suddenly felt really guilty. Like I've seen the other side and it's more beautiful than ever. How could I go on eating regular food when I know such sandwiches were possible? It was like putting on a pair of cashmere socks to run the marathon. The guilt and impracticality overwhelmed me. If you're reading this trying to make up your mind about whether or not to try this place, DON'T DO IT because it'll ruin you for sandwiches forever. Your mom's love-packed lunches will fall far, far behind and you'll never be able to look her in the eyes again because you're sandwiching somewhere else. Do you want to do that to your mother? Do you want to forsake ever having a normal sandwich again? Is that a sacrifice you're willing to make? When you lie awake at nights thinking about this place, you'll hear the wind whisper, "Loenstein, Loenstein, your sandwich is ready....."
It's like somebody told you to go to the corner of 16th and Sanchez because there was a unicorn there. Seriously, a really beautiful unicorn with flowing, rainbow colored hair n' everything! You just HAVE to go see the unicorn... right there... on 16th and Sanchez. Would you believe the hype?Well, I did and today, we decided to drive all the way to San Francisco for yes, one of the best sandwiches ever. I mean, how could we not? It was Ike's birthday after all and Misty had bought him a princess balloon n' everything! Ike et Co. are amazing people. Heck, I was only standing there for maybe 5 minutes and I think the only words I said to Ike were, "Ex-Boyfriend" (darling name of the sandwich I ordered) and "Happy Birthday" BUT STILL I could tell that they were amazing people. They had to be to make sandwiches bursting with that much love. Like many other Yelpers, I can't wait to go back. I'm jealous of my friend Misty who A) lives a block away, B) may get a sandwich named after her, and C) got to eat an Ike-made sandwich 3x this week already. On the other hand, I love my friend Misty for introducing me to this gem of a gem of gem. LOOK OUT! I'm going to start cataloguing the sandwiches I eat here because yes, I'm definitely going back to see the unicorn. Besides, I had SO MUCH trouble deciding on which sandwich to order. I want to try as many as I can!March 26, 2008 - I ordered the "Ex-Boyrfriend" on Dutch Crunch which had what I believe to be not one but TWO kinds of lean, high-quality salami, Ike's yummy, perfectly cooked (not limp, not burnt) bacon, cheddar, dirty sauce, avocado, lettuce, and tomatoes. The sandwich was heated to perfection so that the cheese was all gooey-melted, the bread was toasted, but not dry, and everything was warm and still moist. I hate how Quiznos toast their sandwiches. They have a thing or two or three hundred to learn from Ike's. And the dirty sauce - garlicky deliciousness. Now THIS is my kind of mayo! I wonder where they get their bread? I never had Dutch Crunch that good - chewy n' tasted like it just came out of the oven fresh.April 12, 2008 - I brought a loved one to Ike's because A) mama always said sharing is caring and Ike's sandwiches of love are totally meant for sharing and B) if I brought a friend and we each ordered a different sandwich then technically I would get to try TWO of Ike's incredible sandwiches... GENIUS!I am not a wine connoisseur. I buy wine based on what the BevMo! employees tell me to buy or if the bottle's got a cute label. However, I am proud to say that I am a chicken fried steak connoisseur. My skinny Asian @$$ is from the South, after all. Cruising through the menu, I knew I had to try it... the "FORTY?!" A chicken fried steak smothered in melted cheddar cheese on dutch crutch. Oh mercy! I'm not gonna lie, it was greasy, it was fattening, and my arteries probably cried a river afterwards, but Ike is a mad genius. I talked to him afterwards and he told me that he had originally made the sandwich for himself. Well, Ike, thanks for sharing. Chicken fried steak was flavorful and still had a bit of a crunch despite being made up into a sandwich drippin' in dirty sauce. The second sandwich I tried was the "Super Mario" and it's... you know why Ike's so successful? Because he doesn't just make a meatball sub with frozen stuff. It all tastes like it was made carefully. I heard the vegan meatballs were killer, so in my mind, that meant that the non-vegan meatballs were gonna be good. I like being right. Melted mozzerella sticks, tangy marinara sauce, and let me tell you, I don't like wheat, but Ike's wheat bread is soft and cushiony and delicious. Way to go, Ike!
I am not sure what good this will do, Ike's is one of those places that is so busy, they could care less about unhappy customers. But what the hell. You are making a sandwich, how hard is it to get the order correct. Yes I understand that half of your staff is stoned and the other half are college drop-outs. Maybe you should take some of that $$$ you are raking in and pay a higher wage and get some employees who actually care about the product and the guest going out the door. Its too bad, Ike's is close to my house and has become a place too fall back on. But now that I think about it, the sandwiches are way too much and the portion sizes are getting smaller. And this wasnt a one time thing, its just the first time I asked for my money back.
I finally got to try this place after having heard about it for a really long time. Unfortunately, I waited until their last weekend before they're evicted which just teases me because I loved the sandwiches and want to try more. I tried the menage a trois and the hella fat bastard and both were delicious. Luckily, we got there kind of early and only had to wait about half an hour to get our sandwiches.  By the time we left the line had more than doubled. I'm going to try to make it here one more time before they close.
The sandwiches were super swell and yummy! I was lucky to have gone mid-week, so I didn't have such a long wait. And lucky enough to have the guys pet and then name my faux-fur trimmed vest "Ike." No seating, so head to Dolores Park to savor and devour.
Best sandwiches in the city, hands down!
My boyfriend & I came here for lunch today. Because of reading some reviews, people mentioned about the long wait so we took someone's advice to order on the phone. We called to order at 11:45am and told to have the sandwiches ready at 12:45pm cause that's when we'll be there. We found parking luckily pretty much infront of the place almost. When we got there, it was not at all busy. The lady was helpful but telling us about an app that would give us $2 off. So I downloaded the app but it wasn't working but they still gave us $2 off. My boyfriend got the Napoleon Complex while I ordered the Menage-a-Trois. Both tasted good, but we both agree that we should have just ordered when we got there cause we both felt like the sauce got absorbed in the bread therefore made the sandwiches abit soggy & it wasn't hot whenever we got it so probably it's been sitting there for awhile. Next time we will definitely just order when we're there so the sandwiches are really fresh.
After seeing "Ikes" on the Travel Channel and getting recommendations from friends I finally decided to give this place a try. I was confused when I first arrived at the location being that it was in a different location than previous. I was able to spot "Ikes" from the long line outside. The old location used to be around the corner at 15th and Sanchez, the new location is ran out of the lounge/nightclub "Lime" which is located on Market in the Castro. Unfortunately there is no place to eat inside of "Lime". I went here on a Saturday afternoon, parking wasn't too bad, there is parking on the street via parking meters, and free neighborhood parking a few blocks down if you don't mind the walk. The wait to order you food can take some time, so if you're short of time or are parked at a meter make sure you plan ahead. It took us 45 minutes to order our food at the door, and it took an additional 20-30 minutes for the sandwiches to be made. However they do offer the option to phone your order ahead, so for those who do not want to stand outside for 45 plus minutes take advantage of that. Their menu is very unique and filled with sandwiches of even more unique names, the Tom Brady, The ex girlfriend, I had the M.I.L.F. (Chicken, Franks Red Hot Sauce, Jalapeno poppers, and ranch on sourdough bread, with their signature "Ikes" Dirty Sauce). The sandwich was amazing, even better than I had anticipated, and the cream cheese from the jalapeno popper really complemented the rest of the ingredients from the sandwich. I would definitely recommend this place, their selection of sandwiches in vast and very original, stuff you wouldn't find in other sandwiches like beer battered onion rings, jalapeno poppers, or mozzarella sticks. Ikes also has a great alternative for vegetarians and vegans. The selection of vegetarian and vegan sandwiches is great. Overall based on food alone the food exceeded my expectations, and I had heard a lot about this place, the sandwiches were the best. I'll definitely be back for seconds, and thirds, and even more. The only downfall was the wait, but even that was worth it.
I feel like everyone and their dog have reviewed this place. I had wanted to try out Ike's since it first started showing up on the top five, but for whatever reasons, just never made it over there. No doubt I was around there often enough, but it was always the wrong combination of not being hungry, too long lines, being closed. It just wasn't meant to be, so I didn't push it. So the other week, the boyfriend and were biking to the sunset from SOMA to get nostalgic burritos at gordos on 9th Ave, but while stopping at the bank on Van Ness, we have this great epiphany. "Why don't we get sandwiches?" now that sounds like a good idea, oh wait "IKE'S!!!"Just like fate, we show up 10 minutes before they are closing, so there are no lines and they will still take our order. After having a very lenghty conversation with the vegan cashier, I decide on the FLT with everything. being vegetarian, I have a special place in my heart for fake bacon, very slowing climbing the list of my favorite foods. It will be interesting if bacon and burritos ever have to battle it out for my love. (of course, I wouldn't be opposed to bacon IN my burrito). Ten minutes later I'm sipping my (kind of disgustingly sweet) grapefruit soda when my sandwich is done and I enter sandwich heaven. Now after this I can not guarantee accuracy, but after the angels came and picked me up, I sat on this marvelous cloud while taking bite after bite of my never ending sandwich. The best part was that I didn't even make a mess all over myself like I usually do. I'm not sure how it happened, but I fell of the cloud and lost my sandwich. The boyfriend tells me I finished it, but I swear it was a greedy cherub. Damn that sandwich heaven.All in all, this was the best sandwich I had had in a long time, but I'm not rushing back there right away because things like this must be cherished. What if I ate here everyday and began to believe this was what every sandwich tastes like. I would be sorely disappointed when I was finally forced back into the real world.
I think I have to give this one 5 stars, simply because of the number of choices given to you when ordering a sandwich. It is ridiculous.I've only been once so far, and I went at night, so there wasn't a crazy 2 hour line like some people had mentioned (hint hint for those of you who hate waiting). My friend and I both got the Super Mario, and it was great. Came out hot, plenty of meatballs and mozarella sticks shoved into it to be a complete meal.I would say the only thing detracting from this is the lack of seating, as they can barely fit the business inside, which means there are only two tables and about 8 chairs outside. However, in my opinion that hardly merited detracting any stars. I am definitely planning on making another trek down there in the future to try something new. I'm thinking it will be one of the Giants themed ones.
I waited about an hour on a great Sunday sunny afternoon, which was like a 30 minute wait to order and another 30 minutes to wait for the actual sandwich. I honestly didn't mind the wait, to be honest. I ordered a Menage A Trois on Dutch Crunch and throughly enjoyed the hell out of that sandwich. It was definitely worth the money and the long line. Stop reading and just go already, lol.
Ike is the man. I think I saw him on the street one night around 1am and he was hammered!These sandwiches are big, unique, and delicious. I would suggest eating here to anyone I know without hesitation.Jaymee Sirewich = ranch, pepper jack, chicken fried chicken, ikes yellow bbq. Get this one
They put a lot of love in them sammiches, which in turn make me in love with them.
I've had Ike's at least 10 times, getting a different sandwich on every visit (though I will admit I get the dutch-crunch bread every time). They never cease to impress me!
Ike's Place has the biggest and best sandwich menu I have ever seen.  Spiffy Tiffy is my favorite and is dripping with dirty sauce and all kinds of yummy goodness. Don't let the crowd of people waiting for their orders scare you away. Their employees are super friendly and make the time pass in a breeze and the sandwich is definitely worth the wait. If you have never been here, do yourself a favor and give your taste buds a taste of heaven and thank me later.
If you're looking for a gooey, sloppy, juicy sandwich that's full of flavor, look no further. Ike's not only has great tasting sandwiches, but they have a great selection too. I always feel satisfied.I'd eat here more often if the parking wasn't so hard.
Ike's knows what it takes to get people to keep coming back: great sandwiches, endless choices, innumerable veggie options, fair prices, and friendly employees. My personal favorite is the Pilgrim on Dutch crunch!
This place really has great sandwiches. Interesting, novel combinations of ingredients that really work. Lines can get pretty long, but it's usually worth it. Yum! They are pretty big, so you can eat half for lunch, and the rest as a late afternoon snack.
Not only are the sandwiches delicious but Ike is pretty awesome too! My boys love the Super Mario, and my 7 year old left a comment complimenting Ike on facebook and he responded back. He and I both thought that was pretty cool. Sandwiches are messy, but to die for! Dirty sauce is AMAZING! So nice to have 3 Ike's within 25 miles of me. Thanks Ike!!!
Best sandwich I've ever put in my mouth. Ike is a damn genius and his sammys are works of art. Fat-laden art, sure, but delicious art none the less. There are tons of hidden gems that aren't on the menu so feel free to chat up the counterperson, tell them what you really like on your 'which, and let them suggest some other things you might fancy. Either way, any sandwich with Ike's name on it will surely please the palette.
Great sandwiches...nay amazing sandwiches, the chicken is profound...and I never order chicken, the girl I'm dating is my favorite and the girlfriends gets hers with mozzarella sticks or jalapeo poppers I can't remember, but by the time we order around 7ish they never have any left so minus one star for that, I always call in my order and after 15 mins I'm paying for it and have it in my hand, it's one of the great 3 sandwich spots, little Lucas, Darby dans and Ikes, ikes is the closest to me and hence my fav.
I live nearby and I love the variety of sandwiches and the dirty chips.
I heard about this place from multiple friends so on Easter my friend and I decided to come here and grab lunch before heading over for the annual Hunky Jesus contest in Dolores park. When we got there, we were greeted by a peppy girl ready to take our orders. Since I was an Ike's virgin, I asked her for recommendations, and she happily gave me a few suggestions based on my preferences. I ended up going with the Nacho Boy (Hot Roast Beef, Mushrooms, Avocado, Swiss $8). It was soooo good. The cheese and the juicy roast beef melted in my mouth, and the crunchy toasted bread added great texture. Ike's has cute creative names for all of their yummy sandwiches. Creative menu, melt in your mouth sandwiches, and a cool staff. Thank you Ike's!
had good sandwiches from them delivered to my office.
Walked in today right at 10 am. Their place on lime is a little bit hard to find. They actually rent out the space and Lime restaurant comes in at around 5 pm. One of the workers said this is only temporary, good thing because this location is more of dinner and cocktail lounge. They have an extensive sandwich menu, there might have been about 50 sandwich choices. The sandwiches were really good but I was a little disappointed that there was no more guilt free fries. They do not serve it anymore since their sandwiches became so popular. I love fries. Hope to go there again soon to their new location and hopefully they'll bring back the fries. I'll cross my fingers.
Just got back from my first visit to Ike's. It's the real deal. Not only good eats but great customer service. When I got to the counter, I described a Chicago style Italian beef - which Ike's doesn't do but I got several different options that could be a substitute. I didn't like any of them so I switched over to pastrami. Now Ike's doesn't claim to do a NY pastrami, they didn't even carry rye bread, but I was offered their version. I was even told that if I didn't like it, they'd build me something else after I tasted it. It was one tasty sandwich. The meat was lean, flavorful without a lot of fat. I'm looking forward to tasting more sandwiches at Ike's.The food is good and the service is as good as it gets.
By the way guys, call your order first if you don't want to wait. I placed my order by phone, showed up when they told me to and got my sandwich right when I walked in the door. Of course it's going to take a long time if you don't call ahead, they've got all of our orders in the queue before you even showed up.
Hey Yelpers, guess what? Thanks for leading me down the path to Ike's, because I now have a super power. I can magically transport a sandwich from my bare hands into my stomach within two minutes flat.Freakin, I'm no sandwich expert or anything, but I'm pretty sure this is as good as it gets. The dirrrty sauce and the hot melty crispiness of the entire concoction (whatever you get) will make you sigh with happiness. It was amazing to sit outside in the sunshine and just enjoy...the two minutes it lasted anyways. That's what she said. Do you big boys even get full with these things? Because I chowed my sammy down pretty painlessly, not to say it's not filling, because it was! Next time I want to try Pastrami and these meatless meatballs yall have been raving about. MM!
One of the best sandwhich places in sf. The service is great, the only thing I dont like is that you cant sit and enjoy your meal. There is no where to sit.
After watching today's "Eye on the Bay" report, which listed Ike's as the 2nd best sandwich spot in the Bay Area, I decided that I had to have one. What do I do first? Of course I look on yelp! Long lines, no parking, blah blah. As an avid restaurant explorer, I know that every problem has a solution.So I phone in my order and park illegally. Yes, there was a line through the door at 6 on a Sunday. But considering the interior resembles a closet more than a place to purchase food, the line wasn't that long. Note that if you placed a phone order, you don't have to wait in line. However, you will have to talk or force your way to the cashier (the latter in my case). And while the staff is perfectly courteous, the customers may or may not be.The sandwich was called a [Name of Girl I'm Dating] and it lived up to its name. It was sweet, juicy and tasted fresh the day after. The bread was excellent and I was pleasantly surprised that the 'chicken breast' was more of a tasty chicken salad. My only beef was that the zucchini sticks were absolutely horrible. They may be air-baked or whatever new wave health craze dictates they be, but they tasted like old zucchini baked in cigarette ash. Apart from that, very good!
I don't really get it, but this is probably my own fault, as i'm like, the antithesis of a sandwich snob - i like my sandwiches fresh and simple (read: boring). So i wasn't too stoked about waiting such a long time (even with a reservation) for my greasy - though quite flavorful - sub. They were out of 3 or 4 really basic ingredients, so my veggie friend couldn't get what she wanted, and at one point the dude ran to like, a corner store somewhere for more avocados, which made me question the freshness of anything there. Can't tell the difference when it's all smothered in that sauce and mayo, right?Finally, the whole make-a-reservation-for-a-sandwich thing was a total turnoff. Like i said, i'm not a sandwich snob. 3 stars instead of 2 because it's probably the case that "it's not you, Ike, really, it's me".
Wow, these sandwiches will blow you away. I just hope they get there own place sometime soon.
Vegan meatless mike. It felt naughty, but soooo good for this vegetarian who is forced to watch her bf chow down weekly on amazing smelling meatball subs from a local sammie joint in Sac.Thank you for reconciling those urges, Ike. I feel like I am back on the straight and narrow. Can't wait to try another upon my return to the city.
Hands down THE BEST Sandwiches in the Great State of California if not the country or the world!!!!!!!
Long wait but it's worth it.
I hated this place. Even there most simple sandwich had a lot of crap in it. If you like clean, healthy, simple foods, you'll be glad this place is gone.
WOW they raised the sandwich prices from $2-$3!! I'm sorry but i'm not going to spend $10 for sandwiches in this economy. IF i was going to spend $10 on food, i rather get groceries and other healthy food. I'm not ever coming back and that includes my friends too. We all agree that it's just too much for sandwiches. I'm not coming back until this drop their prices...otherwise i can live without it. SAVE YOUR MONEY!
I really hate to give this place a 5 stars. I mean I would love to rub it in the face of my friends who are obsessed with this place and tell them it's not that great I just can't do it. This place really has the best sandwiches i have ever had hands down. Anytime i happen to find myself in SF, I'll be sure to eat here at least once.
After Man v. Food, we had to see what Ike's was all about. Went on Sunday, the line was about 30min but worth the wait. Ordered two sandwiches, the pizzle and eli manning, and both were DELICIOUS. The owner and the employees are nice and service was fast. Definitely coming back. Take advantage of adding extra dirty sauce, even just for the name itself.
love it. great sandwiches. can't complain at all.
It was as if the cosmos of the universe came together and i reached sandwich enlightenment. For the sub-sando god so loved the world that he gave Ike's Place. I believe it was Shakespeare who said (verbatim), "I'll follow you and make a heaven out of hell, and I'll die by Ike's sandwiches I love so well." Not only are the people incredibly friendly, but Ike, himself, came by to make sure we enjoyed our sandwiches. I've never expressed so much adoration for a sub like i did to Ike. I had the #30 Backstabber - TO DIE FOR.ike's is truly as good as it gets.
Just like everyone and their mother, i'm going to start out like this."how good can a sandwich be?THIS GOOD! ...Words can't express the amazingness that is ike's. Just go and eat a damn sandwich. listen to what the guy at the register recommends i.e. "if you like pesto, that sandwich will taste great with pesto" LISTEN TO THE MAN. HE KNOW WHAT HE SPEAKS OF.so, in conclusion, i can't believe a sandwich can be this good, just go there, and listen to what the man says.p.s. airfried, fried food. can't fry healthier than that! hah! =D
On a perfectly sunny day in San Francisco, I must admit, not much can bring down your bomb ass mood. BUT the real clincher is when you can find something to ADD to the bomb assness of that mood.That something is Ike's!My brother brought me here on a weekend home and when my brother is like, hey, let's drive across town to the Castro, where parking is tough and pick up sandos - I listen.1) Ike's made me nostalgic (hello, sandos with names like Lincecum, Pride of the Castro and SF Giant) in the best way2) It's so cute how it's tucked away on a random street3) THE STAR IS THE SANDWICH. I don't know what that secret sauce is, but it's damn good. Any any place that has avocado on the menu 25 times (that's only the "meat" sandwiches), including one sandwich, the Dirty CA-Roll, that has avo twice, has a place in my California Girl heart.Hit it!
I was somewhat suspicious of the buzz about this place, but it turns out to be wholly justified. I had the Nacho Boy sandwich, and it was pretty much everything I could ask for in a sandwich. When I find a place this good, i have to keep trying everything on the menu until i find the best thing. I'll be coming back here often. Slight word of warning - you may have to fight crowds of vicious hipsters to get a place in line. If you are anything like me though, you eat more than one sandwich a week and can take them.
I can't stop coming to this placeI HATE YOU ( but in a good way )all kiddiness aside, this place is one of the best, if not my favorite,  to get a sandwich.TRUE, they may take awhile to make sandwiches, but they are making quality products, NOT FAST FOODCall in 30-40 minutes ahead and order your sandwich. That way you can do other things like read a book, do your laundry, etc, and then pick up your sandwich when it's nice and toasty ( hot really)trust me, it works. ( i do it all the time )and 7-8 dollars a sandwich ain't bad. You pay just the same at other places and they are not always that good. And I'd take a lolipop over a bag of chips any day.
It's been less than a week and I stopped by Ike's again. Took my brother this time who's visiting from out of town.Note: must order any/all sandwiches on their Dutch Crunch bread. It brings out the flavor of their dirty sauce that much more.My brother ordered the Nacho Boy Supreme which comes with roast beef, avocado, mushroom, cheese, and bacon. I ordered the [Name of Girl I'm Dating] with turkey (they ran out of chicken today), avocado, honey mustard, and jack cheese.Both sandwiches are delicious in their own way and bursting with flavor. The Nacho Boy Supreme is meaty with the slight crunch of the bacon and juicy from the cheese and mushroom, my sandwich is pretty messy because of the sweet honey mustard sauce.I've never been to a better tasting sandwich joint than Ikes.
My wife and I went to San Francisco for our 1 yr anniversary and ate at Ike's the night before our anniversary. We liked it so much that instead of a typical candle lit dinner on our anniversary we went back to Ike's for more sandwiches!! My wife is a classy lady but is not against enjoying a great sandwich on such a special occasion. If you like sandwiches and you are in the area, GET ONE OF THESE SANDWICHES!!!!
Yup, believe the hype. And I rarely do, but now I'm a believer. Kind of like how I used to not believe that Obama could be president.Speaking of, I got the Change (steak, smoked gouda, beer battered onions, and BBQ sauce) on Dutch crunch and everything on it. I only wish I didn't wait 'til got home to eat it, as there was a table available (I got there early) and it was sunny. I don't recall having a sandwich this good in a long time (not counting Tartine's fancy schmancy sandwiches).Awesome.
Had the kryptonite and honestly, the sandwich was well worth the price. I split it with a friend and it was the perfect amount of food (and I can eat quite a bit of food). Deliciousness throughout the entire sandwich. Definitely worth the hype and the drive to get here.
we were lucky to have gone during a slow time on a tuesday evening. only about 3 orders before us (just because it took us a while to decide)I had the Mills Vikings w/o ranch, my friend had the fat bastard, both on dutch crunch...yummmmm, the bread was perfectly toasted and everything on the inside was perfect. I usually like to add chips on my sandwiches to give it that additional crunch/kick. even though i did for this sandwich, but i don't think it needed it.and according to my friend, it was "food utopia"...for me, as far as sandwiches go, it was MWAH!can't wait to go back and try the other sandwiches!
After all the rave reviews here on Yelp my buddy RB-eezy and I decided we need to check this place out for sheezy!Our coworkers and I all picked out our sanwiches and called them in. Being the muff-diver that I am, I opted for the "Pride of Castro", which included turkey, ham, and brie. Sounded delish.RB-eezy picked them up and brought them back...All of us enjoyed our sandwiches but also agreed that they were kinda soggy. The shredded lettuce kills, and I think since they're heated and then wrapped up, the steam makes them kinda mushy. Other than that, mine had a nice filling to bread ratio, and good flavor. Overall, I would try Ike's out again, but just make sure that I eat the sandwich immediately and tell them to hold the lettuce! Love the sandwich names. Also, thanks for the lollipops!
OH MY $%$^$& GOD!Imagine that the best sandwich (no matter which one you order) you've ever put in your mouth can no longer ever enter your mouth again, because you find out you're gluten intolerant. Okay now come out of that horrible place and imagine that 6 months later you found out that Ike's has gluten free bread!! Yeah, my mind was blown as well.BEST SANDWICH I'VE EVER HAD, ESPECIALLY BUT NOT LIMITED TO BEING GLUTEN FREE!
All this time, I've been spending an hour+ BARTing all the way down to Roxie food center for what I so naiively thought were the best sammys in town.Boy was I wrong.Ike's blows my mind more than a sexy guy that knows how to dance well.They boast an incredible selection of (albeit strangely named) sandwiches--each available in vegetarian form(!!!)OK, have you ever gone to the chain sandwich places, like Subway or Quiznos, and tried to get something vegetarian? You seriously get two choices. Standard sandwich without meat, or standard sandwich without meat that has some melted cheese on top.Ike's has a fantabulous array of fake meats, soy cheese, and non-traditional toppings (including nummy wasabi-mayo, sprouts, orange glaze, and teriyaki sauce). The "We're JUST friends" sandwich I ordered was nothing less than ABUNDANT in fresh, soft, delicious avocado, which is an incredibly rare thing in this world. Pretty much every other sando place tricks you with either smushed hybrid guacamole/avocado, or with a wedge so tiny you have to commission a treasure hunt...AND it's only three blocks from my work... how incredibly dangerous!
Honestly with all the hype I think I was expecting more.I mean it's not to say that I wouldn't try this place again, but I just felt that the sandwiches could have been better. Maybe it was just the ones I got but still. I feel that there are other places where you can still get a darn good sandwich without all the hassle involved with Ike's. I would say that the sandwiches were ok but not sooo great to wait like 2 hours for.
Alright, came back on a warm, sunny day. +1 star for not freezing while trying to eat.I wish we had a sandwich shop like this in the Mission. Ike's is a bit of a hike from my pad, but completely worth it when the gods are blessing San Francisco with true Summer weather. Ordered the Meatless Mike again and ate the whole thing in a matter of minutes. Best sandwich in the city.
WOW... a sandwich shop making sandwiches by appointment only. A bit wild - and possibly a first I'm guessing.We live down the street, and knew the hype going on about Ike's. Saved our try for a Friday night, thinking, piece of cake, who even eats sandwiches for dinner on a Friday night? You guessed it, 30 minute wait that took us right up to the closing time. This place is doing some serious biz.Ike was a sweetie when I went to pick up the sandwiches and the food was seriously amazing. The chicken sandwich I tried had shredded chicken which helped soak up that rad dirty sauce nicely. Hubby tried the meatball which wasn't as fabulous, but he'd snuck over there a few weeks ago and had better luck the first time around.My only negative comment is that Ike seems to have moved into a spot far too small for him... it's like a big success story with an unfortunate side effect of not being able to keep up with demand. I wish Ike all the best and hope he can figure out a way to make it happen for all of his hungry customers.
Sysco's best - straight off the semi. "Fresh baked bread" = toasted white flour rolls. If being a vegan means eating plastisol, this place is for you.
Subway has nothing on this!!!!!
I lost faith in the sandwich. It really had become a go to meal when NOTHING else sounded good or I was too lazy to make anything else. Ike's has brought me back to the mountain and I am down on my knees praying.....After bowling on a rainy SF Sunday afternoon our friend suggested Ike's, saying he heard it was the best sandwich in town. When we rolled up on the place I almost said let's split when I saw the line. But it was a lazy Sunday and I didn't have anywhere else to go. So I waited. WOW is all I can say. The selection of sandwiches alone is great. I got the Super Mario on french bread (All Beef Meatballs, Mozzarella Sticks, Marinara) Are you kidding me! meatballs and mozz sticks together on a sandwich! soooo good and the bread was perfect and fresh. I will be going back often to try every sandwich
Main Cain is one of the best sandwiches I ever had.
Anywhere that appreciates that you're on a wedding diet and will make a sandwich accordingly? 10 stars. We had a fresh veggie sandwich and the meatball sub with no cheese. Still tasted like something I wanted to write home about. I love Ike's.
Mnage  trois? Oui, oui! And Ike does it dirty dirty.Now get your mind out of the gutter.If you are a San Francisco foodie, you know I'm talking about Ike's sandwich #111. Halal Chicken Breast, Real Honey, Honey Mustard, BBQ, PepperJack, Swiss, and Smoked Gouda on that toasted Dutch crunch with the dirty sauce baked right in! For good measures, of course they spread it on the sandwich. What is this amazingly addictive dirty sauce you ask? Ike's house garlic aioli sauce with herbs, spices, garlic, and secret ingredients. Mnage  trois, you are one hell of a sammy!
Amazing sandwich from a small little restaurant. Saw this on one of the evening city shows and had to try it out.Had the Phil's BBQ sandwich - roast beef, cheddar, and bbq sauce with lettuce, tomatoe and dirty sauce on Dutch Crunch bread. The sandwich was absolutely soaked in sauce and was quite messy to eat, but had the perfect portions of every ingredient. The bread was warmly toasted and very crispy.You order inside and then wait on the chairs outside, about 10 minutes or so as they handmake your sandwich. There are about 3-4 small tables and folding chairs, and you can find metered street parking.
Menage A Trois -- delish! I need to branch out but I like this one too much to try others. But I make sure always go with someone so I can have a bite of theirs!
Not a whole lotta space - but ooooohhh-weeeee the sandwiches are pretty delish!!I love nothing more than i hot sandwich and it's the worth the wait - as long as it's 15 minutes or less. I forgot what the heck I got but I love the roast beef and probably something turkey related. They have lots of options as well. This place is a size of a living room - so don't come over here if you plan on coming in bigger than a group of 2. 3 is cutting it close. I LOVE DUTCH CRUNCH!!! I LOVE HOT SAMMIES!
Ike's is great.There are a ton of great sandwiches with a wide array of flavors.They are a bit messy, but it's nothing napkins can't take care of.The people there are really nice and the sandwiches have great names.I was a little disappointed that the "Sarah Palin" didnt' have moose meat in it, but you can't have everything.The sandwiches come with caramel apple pops too. How awesome is that?!
I had a delicious sandwich with wheat-free bread here! I give them 4 stars for having wheat-free bread, and bumping it up to 5 for the great tasting sandwiches.
I'll try to save some of you from the same let-down I experienced after going to what seems to be the best sandwich place in the city, at least according to the reviews. I was expecting something really amazing from Ike's, but both my friend and I agreed that our sandwiches were just okay.For $10.80 I ordered a Tony Soprano "with everything, on sourdough" and a can of coconut water. The menu in the store is not as large as the one on their website, so I guess you should study ahead of time. I wanted to order something with eggplant, but saw no mention of it in the store, so I didn't bother to ask. The website lists eggplant as an option.After waiting in line for about five minutes to place our order, my friend and I both waited over half an hour to get our food. Besides that, there were no seats available for us or the other half-dozen people standing around. One guy was sitting in a chair, next to a garbage can, with no table to use.But, everything up to this point wouldn't have phased me one bit if the food had been as good as I was expecting. I'm all about the food! Unfortunately the sandwiches turned out to be just a tad better than ordinary. I've had much better subs, with less of a wait, a place to sit, and for less money.I'll give Ike's the benefit of the doubt and head back sometime to try something different, but I won't be counting the seconds until I do.
consistently yum but really long line.
I saved my first EVER yelp review for the BEST sandwiches EVER!!! Been there many many times (more than 10 times in the past year and a half)...and I live in Los Angeles. My fiance and myself even flew out for only one day to SF to get the Menage a Trois and the Paul Reuben (just cause we were craving it). And, every time we go to SF (over a 1 day trip), we go to Ike's atleast twice!Try everything on the menu. The staff is amazing! Ask them which bread goes best with the sandwich you choose. And, ask for extra dirty sauce. SO good!
kind of weird finding this place. it's in a club lounge called the lime and you ordered up in front and wait for your sandwiches. I don't get to see how they make the sandwich. Was going to deduct a star until I finally got my sandwich: #111 "manage a trolls" (mispronounced/misspelled, so what, i'm not french) on double crutch bread. You get the creamy gouda cheese, the sweetness of the honey, fresh juicy roasted chunks of chicken, fresh veggies on a flavorful, soft and crunchy bread. Delish, well worth it. My friend (who said it wasn't worth the $8) ordered the nacho boy (roast beef) and it looked good too.
Originally lured in by Yelp-- my decision to finally visit Ike's came with my move to the neighborhood. One should be well-versed in dining options in their new neighborhood- from cheap eats to swanky dining. Ike's reputation precedes itself, so I hoped it would live up to its allure.It surely did. I researched the menu on-line before going (I would recommend the same-- the menu is a bit kitschy and I don't think it had everything on it.) and I was surprised and overwhelmed by how many veggie and vegan options it had. Granted, its not that hard to switch out real meat with fake meat-- but not many sandwich places carry a variety of fake meats to appease its veggie/vegan clientele.There is no room for in-store dining. In fact, there is barely room for three customers to stand in the store at once. The rest spill out onto 16th Street. (And spill they do-- the line can get extremely long during rush hour at lunch) Once inside, you'll see a bustling group of young sandwich-preparers joking and assembling sandwiches loaded with dirty sauce.Yes, dirty sauce. It comes baked into every piece of bread (fresh as you order it) and it is worth it. I personally had two different unique sandwiches with similar names: the Waluigi and the Wario, both came with vegan meatballs and marinara; Waluigi had jalapeno poppers and Wario had mozzerella sticks. I figured I would try out their more nontraditional sandwiches for first bite. The sandwiches are given by hand-- usually by Ike himself, complete with a smile and an apple caramel lollipop. As for the sandwich?Let's just say that I know where to take friends who visit my neighborhood.
This place is amazing. Seriously. I live a few blocks away and can't believe I hadn't made it here, yet. Fresh baked bread, great service, tons of toppings and almost too many sandwich options. The only drawback are the lines, if you go at a peak time. For larger orders, call ahead so you don't have to wait.I got the Cal BLT (without the cheese) on sourdough, which is great. I love the addition of pepperoncinis, pickles and their "special sauce". A great place for a sandwich (which I find a rarity these days), with generous sandwiches at great prices. They lose 1 star for the lines and wait...
I love this place. Go for the Backstabber - perfectly melty cheese with artichokes and shredded chicken on a sourdough roll.#6 is also great, louisiana hot sauce, same melty cheese, same perfect roll, ranch and chicken...yummmm.Ike is super nice, his staff is very welcoming as well. Generally a great place to hang out...and will make you want to try all the sandwiches.
In the interest of garnering some "useful" votes, I'll veer away from waxing poetic about the #2, Christine's New Strawberry Girl (my favorite -- try w/ avocado). We all agree that the sandwiches are great, Ike is great, his mom is great... But as a chocolate milkshake-a-holic who's sick of begging my friends to drive me down to St. Francis Fountain, I was worried that I might need to nix my habit and go to some sort of chocolate rehab. Enter Ike and his fabulous (and not much yelped) ice cream!! The chocolate milkshake is the perfect straw-drinkable consistency and I actually think it's better than St. Francis b/c they use chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce. Next time you're there for the fabulous sandwiches, hook it up with a milkshake too... plus it'll give you something to suck on while you pine for your sandwich.
When I lived in LV, all of my Bay Area friends raved about this place, even those from as far as Santa Cruz. I gave it a try and I must admit that it is hands down the best sandwich of my life! The "Just Friends" is my favorite.
Best sandwich I've had in San Francisco.I'm sooo picky about sandwiches/condiments. They got it just right and have about 96 different choices. The price is right. Apparently if you're getting sandwiches to go on a Sat afternoon it take a really long time.They're huge and totally worth the wait. I am SO glad my boyfriend lives within walking distance of this place. I will be here again and again and again. I'd rather eat at Ike's for every meal than go back to Burgermeister (see review below).
why the residents in the neighborhood want to close this place down is BEYOND me.... you live next to IKES. stop complaining. ok. on to the food. word of advice: if the thought of fried mozzarella sticks or "dirty sauce" in your sandwich grosses you out--turn back now. those of you brave enough to sample the disgustingly delicious concoctions, visit Ike's Place. when first visiting this place with my gluten free homegirl, amanda.. i was expecting nothing more than a local sandwich shop serving gluten free /vegetarian/ and vegan options. (none of which apply to me). instead, i got the best down right gluttonous sandwich ever : the damn straight. shredded chicken breast, marinara, mozzarella sticks, and dirty sauce. i dont know what it is.. but that marinara was perfectly sweet and savory, the dirty sauce had that hint of garlic, and the generic mozzarella sticks tasted like a gooey cheesy crunchy party! i usually never plan on finishing the sandwich because they're so huge, but once i get half way through, its just too good to stop and i end up gorging myself with the other half. YES, you have to roll home because you're stuck in a food coma, but its totally worth it.
I've been trying to think of a way to dance around this all day and have decided that to do so would not do Ikes justice. So here goes. Ikes makes sandwiches for stoners. Sandwiches made for stoners by stoners. Weird mixed up ingredients on sandwiches with funny names. I'm not sure if sandwiches for stoners is the concept, but it matters not. They nailed it.I myself have not been 420-friendly in number of years but will acquiesce to having had a tasty sandwich patriotically titled "Change". What sliced beef, onion rings and BBQ sauce have to do with the current admin. I know not.Talking with Scriv after, we came up with a great name for a sandwich I wish to donate here now to Ikes. I hope it gets used."Do you remember the name of that sandwich i had last time".
If you're in san fran and are craving a sandwich Ike's is the place. Large selection of specialty sandwiches with every one being better than the last. Little pricey for a sandwich but they stuff them to make it worth your money. Definitely recommend downloading the app and ordering ahead as there is usually a 20+ minute wait. Highly recommend the Super Mario which is not on the traditional menu but is a delicious meatball sandwich, add some mozzarella sticks and you're golden.
Ike's was going to name one of their sandwiches Chuck Norris, but the last person who tried to take a bite of Chuck Norris will never be able to eat a sandwich again.
Ike's is damn good- the meatloaf vegan sandwich, the cheese really cheesy, really convincing and the "meat" was spiced with the likes of onion, oregano, and did i taste some paprika? i have no idea, but whatever it was it was really good. i made the mistake of stopping by on my way home and attempting to eat it in the car. do NOT try this- it was wrong- slurping drips of marinara, and honks from people being disgusted by my messy sandwich eating, and me attempting to drive the with backsides of my hands to not smear marinara all over the steering wheel. the meatloaf is an engaging sandwich experience, be prepared to take it on.My suggestion- half orders? do they make them? Its like the juiciest sandwich I've ever eaten and half of it was equal to a bursting mission burrito. and unfortunately, you can't really save half a soggy marinara loaf.
I don't want to bore everyone with the same I LOVE THIS PLACE review. I simply want to add that after discovering Ike's, I cannot imagine grabbing anything else to eat when spending my Sundays at Dolores park.The bread is crispy in just the right amounts and the meat is always extra fresh. Call ahead though otherwise you'll be stuck waiting in a 20 minute line followed by 35 minutes of prep time.
I just went in to Ike's place for the first time today. I have previously heard two things about their sandwiches:1) Their sandwich is like the second coming of Jesus (if you believe in that stuff)2) You have to wait the time it'll take for the second coming of Jesus to arrive to get said sandwichesSo, it being a Tuesday afternoon at 1:30pm, I walked over and ordered their most popular sandwich, a #9 (Chicken, Honey mustard sauce, avocado, pepper jack cheese) and wait a decent amount of time, maybe 15-20 minutes. I looked on the sign out front and wondered how a sandwich place is so popular that you need to make reservations on a weekend.Then I took a bite and understood. I think I literally said, "oh my god" after my bite, loud enough where Ike asked if the sandwich was okay. And I was by myself, which was a little embarrassing.Seriously, their sandwiches are AWESOME. They are big, they're messy, and I only had a half a sandwich because eating the other half would probably put me in a food coma. And yes, Ike really is friendly, asking me if I liked the sandwich afterwards and seemed genuinely concerned, even though I was eating by myself and had headphones and a backpack and totally had the "I have a million things to do don't bother me" vibe going on.So basically, this place is an IDEAL "I have the day off from work want a late lunch spot" place. Yes, the sandwiches take a while, but seriously, you're in the CASTRO and if you want quick you go to Subway up the block. A place being too popular is really NOT a bad problem to have, in the grand scheme of things.
After seeing the bright marquee outside the place, stopping by to see what the fuss was about, getting the pineapple and ham special, making a huge mess by devouring the most amazing sandwich i had in a long time, looking like a cro magnon woman, feeling so full and satisfied, i thought I'd stop everyone passing by and create a little cheer leading team for Ike and his place. Everyone together: ' Ike and his place are FAWESOME** ! '  F-A-W-E-S-O-M-E! [ F ]    [ A ]    [ W ]    [ E ]     [ S ]   [ O ]   [ M ]    [ E ] *\ O /*   *\ O /*   *\ O /*   *\ O /*   *\ O /*   *\ O /*   *\ O /*   *\ O /*  /_\       |       [_]       |       /_\      |        |      /_\   \ \      / \       LL      JJ       / \      LL      \ \      / \** the F word + Awesome = Fawesome!
The PIZZLE is to die for!!! Do your mouth a favor and order this amazingggg sandwich!
Ikes has over 100 sandwiches and all of them are yummy. I have driven over an hour just to come eat here. Yeah, it's that good. Must try the menage a trios.!
I didn't know a sandwich place could be this good. We'd been meaning to go to Ike's for ages, but the line in front always scared us away. Today, though, we got there just before they were opening at 11am and hung out with Ike and crew.We had the Stupid Eggplant Sandwich and the Paul Reubens, both of which were really tasty. The eggplant was a perfect eggplant parmesagn. The Reubens, which is corned beef and slaw, was salty and sweet and vinegary. And I've gotta love any place which lets me indulge my dutch crunch habit.Only downside is how long it can take -- they make each sandwich carefully and by hand and it shows -- so I'm going to keep aiming at 11am or calling in advance.
Awesome! Can't go wrong with what you order here! I always do phone orders because sometimes the lines for ordering there are too long.
I believed the Yelp hype. And now, as I sit on the toilet whistling Dixie out of my ass whilst I right this review, I assure you I will never eat at this place again. FOOD POISONING. Ugh.The other, non-related food poisoning part of this review, relates to how the food actually tasted. First, query what is one of the major points of the sandwich. In my opinion, it is being able to eat it with your hands. I ordered the BBQ Roast Beef and I probably killed a friggin redwood considering how many napkins I used. The sandwich would have tasted much better minus all the gratuitous amounts of sauce. The quality of the meat was below average, and that nasty shit known as "dirty sauce" is akin to how I would imagine dirty armpits bottled as a condiment would taste.As stated above, first and last visit to this place.Update:Ike offered me a free lunch for the above review. Automatic 2 stars. I had the reuben. It was a good sandwich. No signs of food poisoning. I will return to try more of his sandwiches. The secret is to ask Ike to go light on the sauce. Tastes much better.
First I'd like to say that sandwiches are among my top favorite foods. I LOVE a good sammich. Unfortunately it is not easy to find said good sammich, even in this mecca of great food, let alone one that will make me leave my neighborhood to get it.Ike's is one such sandwich. Upon my first visit I was told by my friend who introduced me to the place, we would have to make a reservation. I thought this was a little weird and maybe just a bunch of hype, but I went a long with it anyway. We get there, and there are soooooo many choices I couldn't believe it.It took a little time for the sandwich to come, but Ike and his staff chatted with us and it wasn't a big deal. When the sandwich came I was in heaven. The bread is warmed but not over cooked, the veggies are fresh, the sauce was the perfect amount. I couldn't believe it, here was a sandwich obviously made with passion and attention to detail. I ate the whole thing, and was stuffed!!!! For the next 2 weeks all I thought about was how I was going to get back to Ike's to try another sandwich. My second visit was just as amazing. So far I've tried 4 different sandwiches, all of which have been note worthy. Even though this place is far out of my way, and I have to make an appointment on the weekends, I find myself making the trek over to the Castro for Ike's yummy crack infused sammiches and it's worth it!
I am obsessed. I had the Pilgrim, which was vegetarian fake turkey and cranberries.. it was life changing.
i ordered the Spiffy Tiffy and it was yummy! it's a big sandwich and i ate only half so you can save the other half for later or share with your buddy. comes with a bag a chips of your choice.
Ike's gets five stars for five reasons:1) Went to Ike's today and ate the Eli Manning sandwich. It was scrumptious. Divine. Sublime. Damn Tasty.2) They named a sandwich after Eli Manning, who was involved in the single greatest play in Superbowl history. Go Giants!3) With all the BS that Ike's Place had to deal with, it would have been totally justified in leaving San Francisco. But it didn't. It found a temporary home, and is committed to continuing to provide our city with delicious eats.4) They gave me a lollipop.5) To hate on the fools who just gave a one star rating because Ike's tried to do a fun, light-hearted promotion involving yelp. You are taking this Yelp thing a bit too seriously. Breathe in. Breathe out. Relax. It's not that deep.
Excellent sandwich!!!!!!!!  I would've gave it 5 stars, but the one hour wait turned me off.  Kinda pricey as well.  Will go back when I have more time to kill, otherwise, I'll try to call in for pick up instead.
Yumm this place rocks my socks off. I love there gluten free bread its OMG amazing. Not to mention there sandwiches are hella amazing they are totally one of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten hot or cold. The staff is supper friendly and come early or durring a week day because the place gets extremely busy. This place is great for meat eaters, vegans, vegeterians and of course those people who are gluten free. It is one of my new favorite places to eat in SF.
I'm not even sure why I'm writing a review for Ike's. From the ratings, it seems that everyone knows about it, and everyone who knows about it gives it a 5. Me writing another 5 star review for Ike's won't really give people any more information than they have already about this place. I halfway thought of giving it a one just to stick out from the crowd and to register a miniscule blip today on the rating history chart, but I thought that would be mean to Ike, who went out of his way to be nice. I told Ike I'd never been there before and I'd heard about him on yelp and he was very patient, explaining a number of the favorites and then recommending the Paul Rubens. Well, not only do I like Reuben sandwiches, I like Pee Wee Herman so this was a good choice.I went in around lunchtime and there was no wait at all! I sat at an outdoor table, enjoying the breeze while they made my sandwich.  The sandwich was great, and although I would've liked a little more corned beef, it was extremely well balanced between the veggies, the meat and the bread. It is nothing like a "traditional" Reuben, but that's not the point. It was a solid sandwich, probably a 4 star one on my scale, but the fact that there was no line, that Ike and his Mom were so pleasant to deal with, and that I found a parking spot right around the corner bumps it up to 5!
Ike's gives me the "itis." You know, that post-eating "I need a nap" feeling you get after you have just engorged yourself with heavy deliciousness, making you consider the possibility of stunt doubling as the blueberry girl in the next Willy Wonka remake. Ike's Place gives me the Itis. Ike's sandwiches are huge. I can throw down in the eating gauntlet, but if I order an Ike's, I'm going to get through half a sandwich and need a nap and a lollypop break.I've tried a few and the backstabber is my favorite thus far. This is my favorite place to take my vegetarian friends. As a former vegetarian, I know how refreshing it is to find a sandwich shop with more options than a grilled cheese or a load of condiments and toppings between bread. Those things are good too and you can find them at Ike's, but everybody likes options, and the options here are great. To anyone who says the sandwiches are too small, you either need to call Jenny or get gastric bypass surgery. Your understanding of serving sizes is clearly detrimental to your health.
Little deli that has been in business for a few months in a non-descript locale and it has the BEST FRIGGIN SANDWICHES EVAR! (yes EVAR). I highly recommend Ike's favorite #1 -- Teriyaki Chicken, Wasabi Mayo and Swiss cheese on dutch crunch. Also worthy of your attention is the vegan meatball sub...quite possibly the best vegan anything I've ever had. Careful if you want to get a sandwich on the weekend...they get reallllly busy. I expect them to work the kinks out though.Ike is also a badass and his mother is a very sweet lady for which I would give them 6 stars in total if I could. She even has a sandwich named after her (#6). Morgan approves...
The hole in the wall deli that lived up to my expectations from fellow yelpers. In fact, this is the first place I went to after discovering yelp.Like everyone says, the dirty sauce is where it's at.and yes, the wait is ridiculous but so worth it. 30-45 mins on peak hours. Also, be ready to eat along the street unless you live or parked close by.
I'm not a big fan of sandwiches but I understand why people love this place so much.I only waited about 10 minutes when I got there at around 12:15ish but it was raining... I had to wait about 20 minutes for the food to come out since there were so orders backed up. Among the three girls, we shared *111. Manage-a-Trois (Halal Chicken Breast, Real Honey, Honey Mustard, BBQ, PepperJack, Swiss, Smoked Gouda) and 5. Nacho Boy (Hot Roast Beef, Mushrooms, Avocado, Swiss).I liked the hot roast beef sandwich more. My friend liked the chicken sandwich more... All three were so full after sharing 2 sandwiches... Their dirty sauce was really good!
Had the Matt Cain and honestly one of the best sandwiches i have ever had. The wait is a little long but well worth it also the tim lincecum is really good as well
Alright. Let's see... we all live in this crazy busy lovely city. We all (well, at least MOST of us), love to find some gooooood ass food that's worth the time, energy, and patience it demands. Ike's is one such place. I come from the open country (actually, plains if you will), where there are more resources, yet less attention to detail and refinement. Moving to a congested and densely populated city necessitates and facillitates an art to all things- including sandwiches. Ike knows San Francisco, and he knows his way around two pieces of bread and whatever comes in between. When considering eating at Ike's- be smart about it. Don't bitch and whine about the wait, or being *gasp* flabergasted or insulted that you weren't just able to ~stroll~ on in and get whatever you want. This isn't Subway. It's not a sub place off the highway where road-weary travelers fill up. This is a local sandwich shop which makes a beautiful product that tries to cater to all of the city. I've had two of Ike's beauties, and they were worth the extra 5 minutes of effort it took to plan ahead. It's kind of a gorgeous plan actually, that the good comes to those who wait. Congrats to Ike. You've done a great job with a small space in the middle of the Castro. You're making a great product with a very nice side of customer service and love. Cheers, and I can't wait to eat some more!
This is absolutely the best sandwich place in the city; maybe everywhere! I had the Say Hey and my friend had the SF Giants. We basically had a half sandwich for both. That dirty sauce on toasted fresh dutch crunch is as good as it gets. On my Say Hey, I opted to get half pastrami and half corned beef. It is definitely worth the wait as the pastrami was so soft and corned beef so tastey! The Backstabber is the next sandwich I want to try. ^^)bThe different names of the sandwiches are just too awesome. With over 100 sandwiches, there definitely one for you. One day I will try the Kryptonite. hahaOnly negatives are scarce parking, long line, and if you were to eat there, be sure to do it on a sunny day.Clean, great value - high turnover of foodI didn't see a restroom.Parking sucks.UPDATE: So I did have the Backstabber though I subbed the Caesar dressing for the red pesto and provalone for smoked guda. This was another awesome sandwich, but I do feel as though the Dirty spread goes much better with traditional meat deli cuts like pastrami, roast beef, turkey, and the like. My favorite sandwich place by far, and because they have a variety of sauces and tasty/seasoned/marinated beef, it makes even the best 'normal' deli sandwich seem plain. ^^
I've been a fan of Ike's ever since I moved into the neighborhood over a year ago. I've probably tried ten different sandwiches here and all of them were fantastic.My standard now is the Superman because it's freakin' HUGE! It's two to three times the size of the 'regular' sandwiches and lasts me for three deliciously meaty meals.I haven't had a chance yet to order one from Ike's @ Lime, but I'm sure Ike has maintained the same high standards as before. Maybe I'll give them a call this weekend....
I had my mom in town for the weekend so I opened up yelp.com and did a search and told her to pick somewhere she would like to go. Wow! Never new my mom could pick such a great sandwich shop. This place is freakin great- so much better than any other sandwich shop I know about. I had a PZ burger and it was so juicy and good! My mom had one of the roast beef sandwiches and it was great too. Tip: they use fresh and good avocados so adding that to your sandwich is a sure fire way to make it taste so much better.
i see why this place is so popular. the sandwich reminds of potbelly's with the bread thinned out and baked with the dirty sauce (aioli) so that everything tastes muy delicioso (ordered a #24 say hey with pastrami, bacon, swiss)should definitely order ahead since waiting in line could be about 30 min
Ike's "crack" Sandwiches....Okay so I will admit that I've gone there twice in a row and if I weren't leaving town tomorrow it would probably be three... I don't have an addictive personality but there are some things that draw you back to your vice. Like a great product and service, the two commandments crack dealers live by... I don't need to be waited on hand and foot just acknowledged here and there. "How did you like the sandwich?" or "See you soon" even "Was everything okay?". These are questions you are supposed to get at a restaurant not at a deli. Speaking of that I don't think I would call this a deli. It doesn't have that weird deli smell of meats, stinky cheeses and freon from the refrigeration. Plus, I would never say to the deli guy "thanks and see you guys soon". Usually deli guys just fill the temporary need of ending my hunger strike. This place kills my craving that I have for a great sandwich...an Ike "crack" sandwich. * Say "no" to crack, say "yes" to a great sandwich.AB
I would drive from LA to Sf for this place. Best Sandwish ive ever had..
Great food. You can't go too wrong with anything on the menu. Some of them taste pretty similar but I'd definitely recommend this place. The wait is very long, probably too long for the experience but it's definitely one of the better sandwich places in the city. Will definitely go back, but only when I've got good company to wait in line with me.
AAAAA-MAZ-ING! One of the best subs I've ever chowed on in my life was from Ike's. I can't recommend it enough... Go. Now. And eat the best sub sandwich ever. I'm almost positive that you will like several different items from the menu. I had the "Name of the girl I'm Dating" sub--that's the only one I have under my belt (for now), which was fantastic. I will be back soon and so should you!
I went here for the first time and ordered a meatless meatball sandwich on dutch crunch. It was very messy, but sooo good. I am amazed that it was meat less! The staff working was super friendly, and very helpful in helping indecisive people like me in trying to figure out what to order. I can't wait to come here again.
If you're visiting you have to visit here for lunch. Awesome!!
Just went to the new location at LIME for the first time today. Vegan pilgrim was delicious. CORY is always helpful and informative, so glad he's still here, I wish ROSIE was still here... but you can't have everything! 5 stars as usual!
The line is long. Hella long. But the Mnage a Trois is worth the wait. I also tried their Jim Bean (sp?) and Tony Soprano, but the Mnage a Trios trumps all. If you're able to plan ahead, I suggest placing a phone order in advanced to avoid the line.
Seriously.The best sandwich I have ever had in my ENTIRE LIFE. My friends think so as well. Not to mention my aunt is really hot momma Huda. What really bugs me are those East Coast Whiners about how it's an appointment only establishment. Maybe if you stepped out of your "East Coast Deli" mind frame and realized this is NOT the East Coast and we DO NOT have a Deli on every effin corner you would realize why quality homemade sandwiches takes time and effort. Go to subway if you want your sandwich to take 5 seconds and taste like shit.It's the west coast... get over it
I finally tried this infamous sandwich joint 3 weeks ago. We ordered 3 bestsellers, which were all written on the menu. I haven't gone here because I love Roxie's. So the sandwiches are tasty, but the wait was comparable to a post office line, DMV, or bridge traffic. Sandwiches can be pricey. Pros - dutch crunch bread, free bag of chips. Cons - long wait, parking can be limited. Come here if you're in the area, but bring your family, friends, and loved ones to Roxie's for better sandwiches.
The sandwiches here are awesome! You can pretty much make any kind of sandwich you want. The line is terribly long during peak times, and sometimes off-peak times.
Vegan sammich heaven! Why didn't I know about this place sooner? If only I had listened to my fellow Yelpers. I'm sad thinking of all the fine meals I've missed. I finally got around to eating at Ike's last week and I've been back three times. It's extremely rare for a sandwich joint to have anything but a crappy boring cheese sandwich as their veggie alternative, so I was beyond excited when I saw Ike's extensive vegan and vegetarian sandwich menu. Ike's sandwiches are creative and fresh and everyone who works there is insanely nice. Even the customers seem nice! WTF?! It's like a delicious Mr. Roger's neighborhood in there. I highly recommend the Vegi-Elvis Kieth and the Vegi-Going Home For Thanksgiving. I'll add more favorites as I work my way through the menu. I also recommend calling your order in since it can take 20-45 minutes during their busy times. Thank you Ike's for making sandwiches interesting again!P.S. For every whiner complaining that they can get a better sandwich on the East Coast - please do. SF is too crowded anyway.
I don't have anything original to add. So to sum up:- meatless mike = tasty sandwich worthy of sharing (& the line moves pretty fast)- dirty's chips = yummy and necessary side (what's a sandwich without chips?)- Ike = consummate small business owner from an era gone by (keep up the GREAT work!!!)- walking distance to Dolores Park = ideal tasty sandwich eating locale
A Dutch chocolate milkshake, procured at Ike's place,has recently become my best friend,my lover,the object of my desire. I'd give all the tea in China,all the money in every swiss bank account that ever existed,I'd swim miles, across a lake of menstrual blood and rat bile,I'd run barefoot through fields of broken glass and discarded used condoms,hold my breath until I passed out and was sure to die,if only I could have another, if only I could slip that red straw of love between my lips and suck the milky goodness into my soul,just one more time.
I went. I ate. I creamed my pants. And now I review. I had no idea how amazing a sandwich could taste prior to Ike's. Sure, Bi-Rite has kick-ass sandwiches with local, flavorful ingredients, and Miller's Deli shines with authenticity, but no one could prepare me for the Ike's Place experience. Stuffed jalapeno poppers IN the sandwich?! What?! Mozzarella sticks too? EXTRA dirty sauce?! (*snicker*) I'm sold. No, really. I sold half of my soul to have another meal here.Word of warning, I would advise you to call ahead and order, as they can take a while to prepare your sandwich, and also, I recommend take-out, so not only do you minimize your wait time, you don't have to hover over other diners for a seat.
This will come as a shock to most Ike fans but I am actually NOT A FAN OF DIRTY SAUCE. I know, I know, sacrilege! But there is something about the sauce that I feel overpowers the flavors of the other super fresh, super tasty ingredients. So, I always say NO DIRTY SAUCE, and the guys/gals at Ike's sometimes give me a hard time, which can be annoying but there is no other sandwich place like Ike's. I love the BLT (it's just a BLT), and the Napolean complex (chicken, honey poppyseed sauce, avocado & havarti).Also, they have quite the selection of veggie/vegan and all the veggie sandwiches I've tried have been very tasty. I highly recommend Ike's! But not the dirty sauce.. ha!
Best sandwich ever! I have been looking for a sandwich place in SF for 2 years now.. and I finally found the best of the best. Get the special sauce. Mnage  trois.... BBQ/honey chicken and gouda cheese.. yum~
You know that joke, "if you love that ... so much why don't you marry it"? I would. I love the sandwiches here a little too much and had to cut myself off this month as it was becoming an addiction. True they cost more than your normal sandwich, and take a little longer to make, but then again I don't think you can get a work of art sandwich, amazing staff, and celery soda at subway.This place makes me think I want to own a sandwich shop in my next life.
This place was one of our man vs food Ventures.. street parking had to walk four or five blocks and not really any seating in the place.. but this place is so worth it.. ill eat standing up.. sandwiches are off the hook.. :) very very tasty.. we ordered...Menage a trois ... halal chicken, real honey honey mustard bbq pepper jack swiss cheddar on dutch crunch bread price $11.11.. good sandwich :) bread and ingredients very fresh.. but my favorite was: Hollywood's SF CheeseSteak.. thinly sliced rib eye, mushrooms, provolone, lettuce, tomatoe, and red onions with their special spread.. which is so good.. on dutch crunch $9.99.. Ike's place is awesome and is so worth coming back.. i think this place will be our new lunch spot everytime we visit San Francisco.. Oh and the employees that work there very friendly.. just be prepared to take your sandwich with you there is just one small bench and three chairs... we walk down the street and ate in front of a church.. lol ;0) we didnt have to wait long for our food .. very good experience at Ike's...Great job Ike's..
These sandwiches are just down right unadulteratedly good and titillating to your taste buds. My girl friend always has the Menage a trois (If you like something sweet this might be your thing) sandwich and my new fav is the Matt Cain (Lots of meats in this bad boy). There is a sandwich for everyone and their dirty sauce is a box of awesomeness. Now keep in mind the sandwiches can be messy and if you wait too long they can get soggy do to the mounds of sauce they put on their sandwiches. I personally love sauces so I am happy, for those who do not care for overload of liquidity coming from you sandwich then by all means ask them to go lite on the sauce. There is definitely a sandwich there for anyone you just read through everything and try it. Sandwiches aren't cheap, but they are filling enough to consider it a meal plus they give you a free bag of chips (Dirty Potato chips another one of my favs) and the childhood favorite caramel apple sucker. First time I had a sandwich from Ike's it was at their Redwoodshores location and it was packed and my sandwich got soggy because we took it to the airport to eat before out flight. I wasn't sold on it just yet, but after finding the Matt Cain. I am sold.Definitely a repeat offender by dirty sauce handfuls!
I normally travel to South San Francisco to get sandwiches from my favorite little sandwich shop. A friend suggested that I try out Ikes's, so my best friend and I decided to try it out for lunch one Sunday afternoon. Upon arrival, we were pleased to find a parking space right in front. We got into a line of about 8 people, placed our order with the really friendly cashier, and then patiently waited for our sanwiches.....and I mean PATIENTLY waited for our sandwiches. I think it took about 30-40 minutes for our sandwiches to get made. I will admit that their sandwiches are really good and that the staff seem really nice, but the wait is just way TOO long for a sandwich. Luckily, I was able to just wait inside my car, but I'd otherwise be hungrily standing around on the sidewalk waiting for my sandwich to be made. It's definitely worth trying, but grab a bag of chips to snack on if you plan to go or call ahead if you can.
Effing East Coasters with laughable 1 star reviews and your whining about ANYTHING that isn't from Back East... do us all a favor and go back East and leave us the hell alone! Haters.As for the sandwiches at Ike's: It's really all about the Dirty Sauce.I would recommend the "16th & Market" sandwich or the "Say Hey"...
Hell ya! Did an angel just kiss my lips?!?!
Waited forever for a sandwich which was no nothing to write home about
delicious goodness pretty much every time i order. i can vouch for the meatless mike, tom brady, and vegan gramps. always on dutch crunch, always without onions. SO GOOD.i live nearby but have learned my lesson - always call ahead and be flexible.only downside (and missed star) is the occasional order error. for instance, my vegan bud bundy tonight... came with the wrong vegan meat. wouldn't have chosen it but for the vegan breaded chicken i thought it would include.other downside was that we didn't get a card for the online review! sad because as an ike's neighbor, i remember when he handed out the opening-weekend-coupon for free ice cream if you ordered a sandwich.otherwise, highly recommended :)
The first I went to Ikes, i got charged twice for my sandwich (it was an accident). Then i came back and i got a free one. i chose the vegan backstabber. the combination of the artichoke hearts and the best vegan cheese i have ever had was very delicious. oh and the boys that work there are really helpful. plus, after you get your sandwich you get a free lolly pop!
Pretty much one of the best vegan sandwiches I have ever had,hands down. It's weird because it's "just a sandwich shop" and that's not the kind of place you would usually fawn over or tell friends about but it's incredible. My friend (on another friend's word) and I forgo our usual eateries while we were visiting SF and took a bus twenty minutes through the Castro.I was skeptical that it would be worth it but we called in our order and arrived to meet the NICEST sandwich shop workers ever and then enjoy one of the hands down best sandwiches I've ever had.I got the vegan turkey marina one and also tried my friends vegan meatball one. Both good but mine was literally RIDICULOUS. Being able to walk into a deli style shop and get a sandwich at someplace where they treat you so kindly and everyone seems to actually enjoy themselves is a really nice change of pace.I'll be back for sure.
OMGGG I LOVE IKE'S!!! i die for ike's. i stand out in the rain for ike's. i hold pee for 20 minutes for ike's. IKE'S is BOMB.Mnage  trois? PLEASE. SOOO GOOOOD. i'm the kind of person who HATES touching food and doesnt enjoy crumbs or gooey sauces or any sort of food residue. But when it comes to ike's i am a total slob. i dont care how many people walk by and stare at me as i indulge in this delightful meal. i don't care if there's honey dripping all over my shirt. SO worth it.i'm moving to va in a few weeks and im pretty sure im going to go to ike's at least ten times before i go. IF ONLY THEY DELIVERED. cross country....IKE please become hella rich and open a shop in dc. i will love you forever more. the east coast could use some goodness.
I'll admit, I was a little skeptical about Ike's at first. I mean, how good could a sandwich be, really?Oh ye of little faith, you should know that Ike's definitely lives up to its reputation. It is a first-class sandwich. Not too big, not too small, lots of flavor, and some character to boot. I got the vegetarian meatball sandwich, which was phenomenal. The dutch crunch gives it some structure, while the mix of veggie meatballs, sauce (not too much, just how I like it), cheese, tomatoes and pickles gives it a wonderful flavor.Finally, it was served with a lollipop. Points for being cute. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the line and the wait for the sandwich can be aggravating if you're hungry. They need to expand already before the rest of SF figures this place out.
Welp, I have to say...Ike's place lived up to the hype! I'm always a little doubtful every time I venture into a new place that has received bundles of unbridled accolades from my fellow yelpers and friends (both, in this case). But I would have to agree all the way about Ike's place...the sandwiches really ARE something to write home about (or rather...to write a yelp review about!) I had the CA BLT sandwich, which came with "meatless" bacon and wowed me with every bite. Even my boyfriend, who was really craving some real meat at the time but settled for sharing a meatless sandwich with me, thought it hit the spot. I can see myself ordering this sandwich time and time again. We got it with pepper jack on dutch crunch, by the way...these choices come highly recommended. As a pescatarian who loves sandwiches, I am always thrilled to find new cafes/delis with menus that extend beyond the basics (they had tuna salad and seafood salad as well as several kinds of fake meats and some straight up veggie/vegan options). Ironically, the only thing I found to be difficult was making sense of their ginormous menu (they have a lot of additions to their standard menu which are advertised on creative, but hard-to-read hand-written signs)! I guess I can deal with that, though!
It's all been said before. This is the best sandwich shop in the world. It's so good, you start to go to other sandwich shops and pretend it Ike's and it makes it better. The food takes a while, but is well worth the wait. And if you don't want to wait, you can order ahead. All 6 sandwiches i've had from here are amazing and I'm sure every other one is as well. Go here before you die.
It was so cold and I biked here. It was spitting rain and my hands were numb. I vowed to stop at Walgreen's to get magic gloves.It was so worth it.Vegan meatball sub.Vegan We're Just Friends.Guilt free fries with BBQ.Damn.Ike appears to be a real live human being...and not only that. He's also nice. And clever. And the purveyor of sandwiches that will haunt my lonely FiDI lunch hour long into the future. His sandwich making conspirators (one of whom I believe is his mom, which is very cool) are equally warm and accommodating. In fact the place was spilling over with family members, which is unutterably cool in my book. Any place that serves vegan sandwiches of this caliber will be host to many visits in the future. The fact that Ike's can serve as some middle ground between -nivores of any kind makes it truly one of a kind.
GO TO IKE'S EVERY DAY.I had the #3 on Ike's recommendation (avo BLT) and it was messy bliss. Substantial sandwiches that nevertheless make you wish they were bigger.Trivial Pursuit on the table.Two people behind the counter who obviously love what they're doing.Support this business - not because you're a hard-ass local-only biodiesel co-op nazi (love your tatts!), but because they smile genuine smiles at you and make you delicious food.
Pretty diverse selection of sandwiches, and their dirty sauce on all is pretty amazing. Did not have the appetite to try the Krytonite (as seen on man v. food), but it does look delish! Only negatives are seating (1 table does not mean in store dining), parking (but hey it's SF), and kinda pricey for a sandwich!
I have died and gone to vegan meatball heaven.I do not lie when I tell you I had this sandwich TWO DAYS IN A ROW.The first was a busy weekend lunch, and yes, I had to wait about 30 min.But I couldn't get that damn sandwich out of my head, so I went back the next day for dinner...No line, Ike and his mom friendly as can be (even had me come back to the prep area to see the tiny kitchen) and made me a second helping of deliciousness. On weekends, give Ike a call with your order and he'll tell you what time it will be ready. The poor man makes 300 sandwiches in two hours on weekends, and he's tired, ok? He needs us to be organized and patient so that we don't wait in line forever and he doesn't sever a finger or something in his haste god forbid.I love this man and I love his establishment.
I thought it was awesome they give you the caramel apple suckers with your sandwich. No need for gum
This place had the best sandwiches ever! Ike's so popular...when you call in a togo order...there is usually a 2 hour wait...it's not Ike's fault that they are much demand for making bomb ash sandwhiches!
This place is totally metal! It looks more like a tattoo parlor than a restaurant, but I like it.The burgers are the shit too. Very good stuff!
this place is sooooooooo good. Service was great, bread was fresh, sandwiches were freakin delicious! I will definitely come back and recommend to all my friends and fam. Went to ike's for the first time yesterday with my sis and cousins. Ordered the menage a trois, philler up kc bbq (with bacon), hot date for hire, and nacho boy supreme all were super delicious. To top it off they give you a lollipop with every sandwich (we got sour apple blow pops). This place is great.
I've been to Ike's once and I can't wait to go back! I'd heard great things about this place but I also heard it could take quite a while to get your sandwich. From the time we arrived until the time we got our food it was about 30 minutes, not bad considering we showed up at the prime lunch hour.I had the M.I.L.F and my husband had the Eli Manning. My sando had tender, juicy chicken, hot sauce, cheese, and JALAPENO POPPERS! Although it was a heavier sando than I'd normally choose I decided to go big on my first Ike's experience. I ate every bite of the delicious treat.We live in the East Bay, but we are constantly looking for excuses to get us to that part of SF now so we can have another round!
Wow, I wanted to write this review last night, but my state of pure sandwich induced euphoria was too intense. I want to go back and change all my five star reviews of places that don't serve 'the fat bastard' to four, just to express how happy this sandwich made me. For some inexplicable reason I ordered mine without onions and pickles. Don't worry, they ignored me, with good reason. Have I mentioned this sandwich was amazing?Also, to the bitchy couple from Vallejo that was all giving Ike trouble (I guess they had seen this place on TV and drove all the way down here for their fancy anniversary dinner and there were pissed when it was like a fancy restaurant or something), next time you might want to at least try the food before making a scene.
i am gluten intolerant, and it is nice to find a place that caters to this food allergy. Bread made without gluten can become soggy and fall apart; needless to say, sandwiches are difficult to find/make/eat enjoy...I agree with another reviewer, the gluten-free bread they use is not the best, but the sandwich itself is fantastic! they have great choices, for an adventurous California sandwich dude to a moderate just want a lunch person...always super yummy, fresh great tasting balanced ingredients. You have to go at the right time (don't know when that is), because it gets crazy in there...it is worth a wait, though
First of all, it looks like the awesome sandwich above the entrance is comin' to GETCHA. Talk about turning the tables! You go, Sandwich! Wait, I meant: THE JOKE IS ON YOU SANDWICH BECAUSE I WILL BE EATING YOUR SANDWICH ASS. AND ALSO YOUR SANDWICH HEAD AND BODY. NEVER MIND.B: More vegan and veggie sandwiches than you shake a sandwich at! With more to come! Apparently a whole new all veggie menu is going up soon with something like 20 veg sandwiches, almost all of which can be made vegan! hot damn!Thirdly: i really hate the word "sammich". stop it. for some reason it makes me think you were molested and stopped mentally progressing from that point on and most likely talk in a creepy high pitched baby voice...anyone else think that?IV: THE VEGAN MEATBALL SUB & GUILT FREE FRIES WITH BBQ SAUCE WILL MAKE YOU RE-CONSIDER YOUR NYE RESOLUTION TO NOT DATE SANDWICHES ANYMORE.  I mean, eat.  NOT EAT SANDWICHES ANYMORE. It was so meaty, I almost asked to be led to the cow it came from so I could be all, "GOTCHA!" and then puke the dead animal all over them. But it was not, it was real live fake meat and it was magical.Q: Ike and his sandwich making partner in crime (I didn't catch her name/have the memory of an octogenarian with Alzheimer's and a concussion but she was awesome and clearly a super talented sandwich maker of delight) were both super friendly and made excellent suggestions and, as always, it feels so great to support a small, local business where the quality is high, the prices are low and the signage is hilarious. AND I TO YOU IN ADDITION AS WELL: Blow me, Subway. Seriously, fuck you and your no vegan sandwich having asses and your corporate drudgery and I know if you were a human, you'd totally vote for Huckabee and drive a ford explorer and jerk it to child porn. AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON TOGO'S!!!!
Yum. Big sandwiches with plenty of flavor. I got the Lizzy's Lips w/ everything on it on the dutch crunch. Can't wait to try out their other offerings.
First and foremost, I'd like to thank Yelp for listing Ike's Place in the Best of Yelp section (that's how I found this place). mmm my mouth is watering just thinking of the sandwich I had yesterday. AND it's walking distance from my house - even better!Name of Girl I'm Dating: hahah love it.. the names all of their sandos are hilarious.. well anyway this sando had: Chicken Breast, Honey Mustard, Avocado, PepperJack OH MY!! I walked home enjoying my order. When i got home i realized the honey mustard was spilled all over my sweatshirt - it was well worth it! So many Yelpers can't be wrong - try it!!
Not bad, but definitely overrated. Let me start off by saying they do make a good sandwich and they have plenty of original choices. Its not a great sandwich however and a bunch of other factors ensure I won't be coming back anytime soon. First of all, big sandwiches? Big sandwiches my ass. Unless you're used to Subway this place's only option is about the size of a medium sub at any self respecting sandwich place. Of course the sandwiches are all about 10- 15 dollars which is about 4-6 bucks more than a large at a better sandwich place.  And what's with the raised prices for the "free" bag of chips and lollipop? Screw the unnecessary sides, they ought to take the inflated price and use it to bolster the size of the sandwich!    Everyone in the world knows about Ike's which ensures that the line is always huge and the wait is generally 1 or 2 hours.  So in conclusion, long waits, high prices, and it offers neither the best nor the most filling sandwiches. I'll stick to Yellow Sub and That's It! thank you very much.
Ike's really is THAT good. the ingredients are super fresh, the combinations are creative, I've never had a problem finding parking, and to put it bluntly it really it the best sandwich I have ever had. and yes, Ike is a really friendly guy. but personally, I'd avoiding having to deal with the whole reso thing on the weekends and just try to make it to castro monday thru friday they're open late and it's just soooo worth it! thanks Ike!
This place deserves 4 stars. Although the drive is quite the drag once you take a bite you will know why the drive is worth it. We got free chips and any choice of drink on the house. The store is a small store located off 16th street so there is no place to dine in. Theres always a long line but there is a reason why there is a long line ;) The sandwich was super fresh and delicious. I cannot wait to come back for more!
This is the best sandwich place ever!! I normally don't like to eat sandwiches but since I was up in norcal for a little vacation I figured why not see what the hype is all about.. and yes it was great!! The line wasn't that bad but we did go on a weekday.. the only bad thing I would say is the seating ..theres only 2 tables and a few chairs so you either eat at home, outside the place or at the nearby park. There is absolutely no loitering allowed because its right next to residential neighborhood.. so if u want to keep the restaurant around..don't loiter but overall freaking fantastic! !!
First of all, my "16th & Market" sub (chicken breast, bacon, avocado, and jack) was perfect: perfect size, outrageously tasty, and kind of messy, in a good way (that garlic sauce gets everywhere!). Like the scores of others who have heaped praise upon Ike's little shop, I also think this is the best deli in SF.Unfortunately, I don't know how often I'll be visiting Ike's in the future. My sandwich--just one, uncomplicated sandwich--took 30 minutes to make. The place had customers, sure, but it wasn't busy. I dont know what the problem was; perhaps a hundred-member basketball team called in an order just before I arrived. Or perhaps they should hire at least one other person to help with food prepartion.Still, I can't get the memory of that delicious sub out of my mind. I'll go back at least once more and, if my first experience proves to be an anomaly in terms of wait time, I'll bump Ike's Place up to 5 stars, for sure.
GO NOW.Best. Sandwich. Ever.Vegans and Vegetarians, prepare yourself:the sandwiches at sweet sweet Ike's are like no other. Go now. Go often.
In the last year I've become a big Man vs Food fan so when Adam featured Ike's I, like so many others, decided to see what all the fuss was about. So we decided to grab sandwiches on our recent trip to SF but who would have thought Ike's would be basically the ENTIRE TRIP!I checked YELP before going and kept hearing how the best thing to do is call ahead so you don't have to wait in the long line. So while 30 minutes away we called and I asked to place an order and the guy says "we can have your sandwich ready at 4:00pm".... it was 12:10pm..... does anyone else see the madness to this??? I've never heard of a place that you put in a reservation for a sandwich! I thought I was being PUNK'D. We do what every other person does when faced with a taste vs wait dilemma... justify. We said let's do it once just to "experience it" so we get there and yep... YELPERS are right and the line is about a block and a half long. Both of us didn't really want to wait in line for a sandwich (unless the sandwich came with a golden ticket to a private tour with Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory) but found good parking and we know good parking in SF trumps it all.We got in line and the line moved maybe a 2 feet every 20 minutes. We stood there in this long line while people in cars staring and take pictures of you, several with looks of wonderment why so many people are waiting for food so you start to feel several emotions... From "privileged" like your in a VIP line and the people looking in amazement are the suckers for not being in "the know" to man this sandwich BETTER be good, to am I THE SUCKER for waiting in this line for a sandwich, to man I don't care how good it is I'm not waiting any longer for this freaking sandwich, which we saw at least 6 people leave like that. We had a side bet when we leave so getting there at 1:20pm I said we be on our way around 2:15pm at the latest, my friend said 2:45pm... we were both wrong. We left Ike's with our food at 3:10pm. Yeah.... I have to say that when you finally get to place your order you are greeted by some of the nicest order takers in SF... bar none. They don't just take your order they actually ask how your doing, make recommendations, and smile. I got the Nacho Boy Supreme (Roast Beef, Bacon, Mushrooms, Avocado, Havarti) and my friend the Change (Thinly Sliced RibEye Steak, Beer Battered Onion Rings, BBQ, Smoked Gouda and they added mozzarella sticks), and two cream sodas for $30. Overall, I admit the sandwiches were good, no... to say good would be to compare it to a sandwich at a fast food place these sandwiches hands down better. I loved mine a little bit more than nothing more than the dutch crunch bread which to me was way better than their sourdough. They don't mix ingredients just for the fun of it, they actually go very well together. If your a meat carnivore and howl at the moon then these two sandwiches are MUST HAVES on dutch crunch. However... as much as I love you Ike for being sandwich innovators of taste I'm not sure someone couldn't just look at your website and combine the same ingredients themselves at home and get similar tasting sandwiches without the additional headaches. I must deduct 1 star for making people wait 4 hours for a sandwich on a call in order and another 1 star for the long wait. Look I know its the whole supply and demand thing so the wait is a result however maybe supply more workers for the demand, no? Several other business grow with their clientele increase so expand and open another Ike's somewhere, get a bigger location to hire more workers and bigger space, or at least have one dedicated person focus on take outs that can have an order done in less than 30 minutes. You charge $8 - $11 for sandwiches and have a line around the corner... I'm sure you have the capital and pull locally to more than accommodate that. The bottom line is as good as the sandwiches were I would NEVER wait in that line again or wait 4 hours for a sandwich so although you get people like me who will go there once a lot of us are not repeat customers. So Ike's might forever be my "one night stand", enjoy it for a moment then leave as strangers and talk about meeting again but never do.
Best sandwiches ever. I wait in line for an hour sometimes because they are just so good. No complaints at all about the food.
These sandwiches are dirty.. in a good way! The homemade sauce goes good on any of their sandwiches. The bread is delicious, quality ingredients and a huge selection of carefully designed sandwiches. I reccomend the Lincecum!
This place is crack.
Finally went here after reading all the wonderful reviews as I was thinking how good can a sandwich be, well it was FABULOUS. Had the 25 (TURKEY, BACON AND SWISS) it was one of the best sandwiches I evern had. The ex got a Spicy Mama Sandwich and again, delicious. The staff was super friendly and the place was very clean. LOVE THIS PLACE!
Hands down, the best sandwich place in SF. Expect long waits in line, but worth the wait. Always get the aoli sauce. Very nice selection of sandwiches. I'd go every wk if I could.
Please open a store in Austin, Ike. Please?This place is beyond awesome. Wish I'd called in the order ahead - I waited about 25 minutes at 4 pm on a Saturday.. yikes! Also, the Blue October cd playing was a bit of a downer (love the music, it makes me sad though). But. if my homemade veggie sandwiches turned out half this good, I'd be happy. Damn.
Always a solid win. So many varieties! The dutch crunch though...amazing!
My doctor told me I have high cholesterol. For a Wisconsin boy, giving up cheese, fatty sausages and meat, is as big a "life decision" as getting married, having kids and moving to the 'burbs. Would I really enjoy my first visit to Ike's having to avoid their "Hella" Fat Bastard, M.I.L.F, Peg Bundy, Napoleon Complex, Do You Smell What Barack is Cooking, and lest we not forget, DOOMSDAY sandwich which includes roast beef, corned beef, pastrami, salami, turkey, bacon, ham, mozzarella sticks, stuffed jalapeno poppers aaaand avocado with their famous drrrty sauce? As we'd say in the midwest, you betcha!I'd wanted to try Ike's for a while, but the long line proved too persuasive to my inner procrastinator. But being a lazy Sunday afternoon, my girl and I waited 45 minutes in line to order. Yes, that is an insane amount of time to wait - especially when you consider the numerous options to explore when ordering and waiting 10 minutes to get your sammy. I'm hoping it was a fluke. A gaggle of cute college girls were flirting with the cashier. I liked how everyone in line chatted and shared menus, even though the place is tiny it felt like it brought folks together. We finally placed our order with a super friendly guy who looked like a skinny version of the Ace of Cakes dude. I ordered the Vegan Cow Tipper, what with my Wisconsin roots, the packers playing that day, and my new found appreciation of all things soy and Boca. Ace of Cakes guy was very cool, and double checked to make sure I understood vegan meant soy cheese, not real cheese, that's vegetarian natch. I really appreciated his attention to detail. He even made sure I was ok with honey in my whole wheat bun. I guess hardcore Vegans don't eat that... whoa. Maybe there was a lawsuit in the past that made him so careful, but I thought it was cool. In the end our sandwiches were spectacular and HUGE. I would be inclined to give them another star if it weren't for the obscene wait. But Ace of Cakes gave me his card, so I'll phone in the order an hour or two before I swing by next time.
Best sandwich ever. Service sucks. I was asked literally to hurry up after getting a menu with 150 items 1 minute earlier. The girl charged us $31 and I watched her put the money in her pocket. Boy the sandwich was amazing. I honestly don't know how this place stays in business with the staff they have.
i've got to concur with jennifer j. here. i want to love ikes - REALLY! but everytime i go i feel robbed after paying $13 for a sandwich and seeing what shows up. it's never fully stocked, it's a moderate sandwich. which would be fine if it was a moderate price.the menu thing is really annoying too. it seems like sheer laziness on ike's part. how it works now is that the only way you can know what the menu is is if you have a smart phone and can access their website. WHAT IS THAT?! WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS EVEN CONSIDERS THIS AS AN OPTION?!! p.s. even if you do have a smartphone to view the menu, it's really hard to see everything and the prices.i understand people are taking them, you have to reprint them, whatever. then you do what other companies do and have signs made to plaster all over your EMPTY WALLS. the line goes out the door, plenty of time for customers to view and choose! it's terribly annoying.i know you guys are making money over there. can you just get a little more reasonable on your prices? and put up some menus on the wall? then maybe i'll come back.
I think Ike's sandwiches are marvelously delicious in that messy, greasy, fried, oozing, sloppy, heavy kind of way. But I like subdued and neat. I like fresh, quality ingredients you can recognize. Enough of that soy protein masquerading as turkey or ham or meatball with their "smoke flavor" and other natural-but-not-so-natural ingredients. And I like good, crusty bread, instead of a dense, bland French roll.I might be a health-freak snotty vegetarian, but I just want real and simple food (that doesn't take 25 minutes to make on a Tuesday afternoon).
Yelpers know best!!Thanks to your reviews, I decided to try this place. Can a sandwich really be that good?  The answer: Yes!Very small place, all the food is to go. The employees are friendly and offer suggestions. The sandwiches are huge, stacked thick, and probably the best in San Francisco. Two sandwiches, and two bags of chips came to just under 20 bucks (not bad!) The cashier told me that although they did not have a printed menu to take home, they do have a menu on their website and will take phone orders.My final word: YUM!
I am a big fan of sandwiches. THIS PLACE ROCKS. It kills quiznos and subway and any other sandwich place. Every sandwich has its own personality, there is a sandwich for every mood haha
This sandwich joint is indeed as good as it gets. Between the epic selection choices, the quality ingredients (especially that chicken... man is that moist), the fact that you can get mozzi sticks, poppers, and/or onion rings on your sando, the fact that they toast their sandos, the hands-down best novelty soda collection I've ever seen anywhere (had the "Cherrywine" soda today - it's like Dr. Pepper but even BETTER), the lil' lollipops they give you along with your email, and the awesome group of peeps behind the counter, this place is a total gem. Ike is a sweet dude and you can tell he puts his heart and soul into this place. I think that's why everyone on here is so freakin' crazy about this place. Definitely not to be missed.
Great sandwich! Get the dutch crunch bread... its the perfect bread!
It's on the 7x7's 100 things to try before you die.. This place was a nice surprise for my bday my bf took me here to grab lunch since he heard it was good. It was the first time we both tried it. He had the one sandwhich with a ton of different meat in it.. The only bad thing was that 2/3 of the sandwhich was filled with meat :( I had the cheesesteak and it was delicious, juicy and messy all at the same time. Thank God they gave us a stack of napkin since we opted to eat in the car up the road. Anyway we also got chips and a Drink with it! So cool and it came with my favorite lollipop.. Caramel apple! Yum. I love these small mom and pop sanwhich shops. I will defintely come back to try out their extensive menu!
I'm not one of those people who likes to wait in line for simple food like sandwiches, but the reviews were so great at this place that I had to see what all the fuss was about.Well, I became and instant fan--awesome sandwiches(they better be at close to $10 a pop). Friendly staff, but horrific wait. I highly recommend calling in your order for pick up otherwise count on a 20-30 minute wait on a weekend.
One word, AMAZING! This is the best sandwich shop I've ever been to. I have drove from Berkeley to S.F. a few times just to enjoy a sandwich at this place. In fact last year on my birthday I chose to eat at Ike's out of all the other options I had. The "Vegetarian Al Bundy" is so far my favorite along with the "Vegetarian Meat Ball" sandwich. If you have a small stomach sharing one sandwich is the way to go (maybe adding on an order of their amazing french fries). I strongly believe if you eat at Ike's you will not be disappointed.
Ikes has the best sandwiches I've ever had.. They're amazing.. If you haven't been you're missing out on awesomeness.
New place, faster service, great sammys......Super mario and name of GF i used to date.....
Still a great sandwich but i'll never come back. I was moving my stuff out of my house down the street from Ike's and I just remembered that I haven't had a sandwich from there in days. I figure, hey why not. I call to try and get a sandwich for 4 people for pick up and they told me it would be THREE DAMN HOURS to pick up some freaking sandwiches. I don't think so. I love you Ike but that's too much.
If you are looking for a great sandwich then you have come to the right place. I have been a loyal fan of Ike's since he opened his doors on 16th street. I remember him handing out coupons to come in and try his sandwiches. SInce then, I have seen many people flock to this great place.The sandwiches are loaded with their ingredients and they are not stingy with their portions. My favorite is the Nacho Boy with cheese sticks.... I especially love the baked fries!!!The service and food is amazing. I love that I can walk in and Ike knows me by name. This is a great place to enjoy and is a favorite of mine.
Yum! Ok, yet another review for my benefit as it's pretty unlikely anyone will happen to pick my review out of the 1,000+ others there are to choose from. Anyways, of course I had to try the #100 - menage a trois from the 100 things to eat before you die. It really was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had and definitely deserves to be on the list. Very sweet and hearty with a tad of sourness. It's got plenty of sweet bbq sauce on it - but doesnt taste like a bbq chicken sandwich. there are enough other sauces and kick to it so it's just its own totally unique flavor. I love banana peppers and there was lots so that makes any sandwich a little more special to my mouth. The chicken was shredded to a perfect consistency, and the bread was a perfect thickness - or i should say thinness. I hate when a yummy sandwich is overly breaded and you cant fit the full sandwich in one bite. This was the ideal size to get every taste and flavor in each bite. We read enough reviews to know we should call our order in so once we arrived they were ready to go. Do that too, its way easier. The hubbs got the MILF - wow, i gotta say if you are getting a sandwich with someone you'll be able to share with the MILF is a good compliment to the menage-a-trois because it's got the sour buffalo flavor going on so they mix nicely together. Anywho - as everyone else has already said - it's a great place. We'll be back many times, each time will be a difficult decision to try something new - or stick with the 2 we already know are fab and have made amazing first impressions on. But i have a feeling it's the kinda place that we really can't make a bad decision, everything on the menu is really tempting.
I've been to Zingerman's in Ann Arbor. Ike's gives that place a run for it's money. I had "Going Home for Thanksgiving." It was amazing.
I walked by Ike's for a long time on my way home from work, and always wondered what it was. Then, when I heard about the wait times for a sandwich at lunch, I remember exclaiming, "It's a sandwich! I don't wait an hour for a sandwich!"Well. Now that I've actually sampled their wares (on a variety of occasions), I have to say the place is basically awesome and the food is worth waiting for. Once I no longer worked 9-5, it was easier to deal with the wait time. I highly suggest calling ahead. I particularly love the first sandwich I had -- the Elvis Keith. Yum!
Order ahead- this place takes forever. I had a vegetarian breasted chicken. It wasn't spectacular and it was overloaded with sauce. The bread was a bit soggy, and overall it didn't mean the high standards yelpers had me expecting.
Ok I am giving 4 stars for the food and that 5th extra star for the people that work there- they are a great group it seems!I ordered the Curtis sandwich and Ike himself went out of his way to suggest a better sandwich for me to get and I went with it- it was delicious!Also i thoroughly enjoyed how it came with those old school caramel apple suckers- good stuff! All and all a great sandwich and a great experience!
Service was great... Owner was really personable and even handed my friends and I our sandwiches. Been to this place more than 5x and keep ordering the same sandwich... "menage a trois" on dutch crunch. Never thought I would wait in a long line for 30 or more minutes just for a sandwich. It's definitely not just any sandwich...Definitely worth the wait!
=== Top 10 reasons not to goto Ike's ===1)...ok seriously. I'm a new vegeterian ... and the meatless meatball grinder is the best sandwich in years ... also Ike is cool.
The Ike's Place bandwagon is damned crowded, but it's a good place to be.Of course, the biggest problem any Ike's visitor has is figuring out which sandwich to order - too many choices! Healthy or artery-clogging, classic or unlikely combos, they all sounded way too tempting. Finally settled on the Backstabber - chicken breast, artichoke hearts, Caesar dressing, provolone - since I'm a sucker for artichokes. The night I went, poor Ike was the only one working in the entire place - everyone else had called in sick. Crazy long wait since Ike had to make each sandwich ordered while taking orders at the same time, but luckily, I had plenty of friends to shoot the sh*t with while we waited.Took the sandwiches home since Ike's is teensy tiny, but the sandwich didn't suffer for the 10 minutes it took to get home. My Backstabber was huuuuge, tangy, and ooozing Caesar dressing and Ike's dirty (mmmmm) sauce."Oh my god, this sauce is amaaazing," I mumbled through a huge bite."We can tell, Christina. You have a lot of it on your face."Whatever. What's the point of wiping my face when I knew it would just be smothered in more sauce a few seconds later?Even though the dirty sauce is heaven in liquid form, somehow it didn't overwhelm the rest of the flavors - the marinated artichoke hearts were delicious and bracing, just how I like 'em, and the chicken meltingly tender. (I'm drooling right now, remembering that sandwich.) Still need to head back to try the fries since there weren't any available the night I went.Don't even try to be "good" and eat one half and save the other - the sandwich has so much sauce poured into it, you'd be left with a weird glutinous mess the next day. This sandwich must be eaten in a very transient window of fresh and hot awesomeness.
2,592 people think Ike's Place is bomb and Ike's neighbors are either retarded or lack the genes necessary to produce taste buds.
I had the pleasure of having my first Ike's sammy just yesterday. I got the #5 on french bread and it was the BEST DELI SANDWICH I've had since I moved to San Francisco almost 4 years ago. They are also famous for their vegan meatball sub which I will probably try next time I go.All sammies come with Ike's "dirty sauce" which I think has some garlic in it...whatever it is, it is yum yum! If you like deli sandwiches then you MUST try this place. The store is small with limited seating and they take a little longer to make, so calling in a order and picking up your sammy carry out is probably best. We also met Ike and he is a super nice guy that takes the success of his Deli very seriously...meaning he makes every sandwich with lots of love.
The Menage a Trois is a great sandwich. I can't wait until they have their infrastructure figured out! (And maybe they can lower prices maybe hopefully please please?)
Don't mess around... check the menu online and call it in early, it will save you and the ikes staff hella time. Also avoiding the gargantuan line is a huge plus. I would suggest the MILF if your ready for it, and for my veg friends the Peg Bundy.
Still amazing. Doomsday was spicier than I remember.
Woohoo! As good as it gets!
Ike is the sandwich-meister. I've been in and out of town for a couple of months, and despite that I live literally cata-corner from the place, I didn't stop in until last week. Had the Say Hey and was pretty impressed. Not blown away, but pretty impressed.I went back yesterday for the Hot Mama Huda, and you can consider my socks knocked off. When I read all the reviews prior to going, I kept thinking "It's a sandwich place - how good can it be?" Well, goes to show what happens when I start thinking. I will definitely be frequenting this place. And get this - the sandwiches are just about big enough for 2 meals, so for $6-7, I get lunch and a mid-afternoon snack! Can't beat it. I met Ike and Hot Mama Huda herself. What great people. Pleasant, happy, and all smiles. Keep pumpin' out the good eats and I'll keep'a comin.Edit: I am officially addicted. It's 9am and all I keep thinking is "when is it 10:30 so I can go get a friggin sandwich???"
Got to admit the place is a lot bigger than the old place, sucks no outdoor seating though. Friendly staff, wait kinda sucked. Only one cashier. Had the kryptonite sandwich, now I was worried that with all the different things that it would taste weird. But I was wrong. It was DELICIOUS! Most people may think its just like any other sandwich place but this place adds so many different things to sandwichs that is what makes it so unique. And OMG it was huge! It was 2 parts 6" each. Altogether it must have been like 4 lbs.!!! I will defiantly go back next time I am in SF. Thank you IKES! FREE IKE!
Had Nacho Boy. Was simply heavenly. It was very good and though it was a little pricey, it was worth it. Staff was friendly. It would've been better if we could've sat down to eat but I'm still a happy customer.
after glowing reviews from friends, i decided to trek over with my friend varsha. we walked into the quaint little store and expected nothing really amazing. when ordering, i asked what the best vegetarian sandwich was. she said "meatless mikesl" and i didn't ask what it was but i got it anyways. around $9 is expensive for a sandwich. i'll admit that. i had a mini-heart attack when i realized that many vege sandwiches come with avocado. long story short, i HATE avocado. to the point where i will violently throw up if i tried eating one (it happened at a fancy restaurant before). rest assured, it was just a meatless-meatball sandwich with provolone and marinara sauce.15 minutes later, the sandwich arrived. didn't look special. it looked MESSY. but i took a bite and was in vegetarian heaven. the sandwich was so tasty. the sauce wasn't overwhelming and the bread was soft. it was really really messy but that didn't matter. they know whats up and included tons of napkins. my friend on the other hand was disappointed that hers was so messy. it looks like they've become so popular that you have to pre-order the sandwiches on the weekend. hopefully, they'll be able to add more workers soon but i wouldn't mind placing a sandwich on hold in the near future.
Obviously this place has only the freshest ingredients for sandwhiches because they have such a high turnover rate. The night before I decided to come here for lunch, I was looking over the menu and drooling throughout the night dreaming of their sandwiches. I had their 16th and market on a french roll. It was delicious! I only regret not buying another sandwich for the road.
Ok Ok Ok, so I know it's a crime that I hadn't had Ike's yet, but I hadn't.......and then I decided since they were operating still (out of the Lime) that I MUST get one of these sandwhiches. Holy F***ing SH!T was this sandwich amazing. I got a hella fat bastard with everything and added sauteed mushrooms and jalapeno poppers. I was not at all upset about this situation. Shit was perfect and one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Thanks Ike!
The sandwiches are tasty. They really do care about the food and the people who work there seem happy and love what they do. maybe that's their secret recipe?I just wished this place was open a little later.
One of the best sandwich joints the city. You could eat there day after day and never run out of choices.
Seriously one of THE best sandwiches I've had! It is hearty and just plain satisfying. The ingredients were fresh and they gave you plenty of it. I recommend getting the dutch crunch for bread choice..it was yummy! Their "dirty sauce" was definitely a winner and completes the sandwich very well. The girl at the counter was really friendly too and helped us figure out what to order with their crazy list of selections.The only downside is the limited seating and I feel that it's still a bit overpriced for the sandwiches. BUT this place is a winner and will definitely return!
Ike's Place is super awesome! Not only were the sandwiches creative and extra tasty, but the staff there was incredibly helpful and enthusiastic. They were super nice and all came outside to sing happy birthday to my friend.No joke about the meatless meatballs. I am a huge meatball guy but they had run out of the meaty meatballs so I tried the meatless ones and to my surprise they were super delicious. Best meatball sandwich I've ever had!
Ike is one of the most friendly people my neighborhood ( I live around the corner). He'll spend time to talk to you about what you like and suggest some things or even customize a sandwich for you. I think the guilt free fries have got to be the best thing since sliced bread! They're nice and crunchy and definitely don't taste lowfat. Also, I'm not usually a fake meat fan but thanks to Laura B and Ike I'm enjoying it very much.Another cool thing is that Please encourage everyone you know to check out Ike's Place. The neighborhood really needs him I really want his business to be successful.
With over 400 reviews speaking to the greatness of Ike's what more can I say that others haven't already?MM MM MM sandwich. MM MM MM sandwich + complementing sides. The special sauce was great and so were the air baked garlic fries. Make sure you bring some gum or breath mints for after bc it'll be hummin. I ordered the 'home for thanksgiving,' their take on the ole turkey/cranberry. And I love their quirky sandwich names! There are so many choices that I can't wait to try another during my next visit.Not much seating inside but that's okay. It was raining that night so we ended up eating in the car. Simple joy in life moment shared right there! Oh yea, the sandwich will get soggy bc of all the sauce. All good: pop it into the toaster oven- problem solved :)
Place is legit. Had the Matt Cain on Dutch Crunch with the dirty sauce and devoured it. LOVED the unique sodas they had for sale. Wife had a vegan chicken sandwich that was also really tasty. But maybe the best part was the service: Purple-haired gal behind the counter was super friendly with everyone who came in, including us when we asked for directions to the closest BART station. Note: They use Halal chicken and not standard chicken, which may or may not influence your decision to have chicken or to come here. But it's worth the wait in line and worth the price if you want a BIG sandwich with unique menu items.
Very good sandwiches.Why do they have a myspace site. Can't they make a real site? Lame!!!
My expectations were high because of all the good reviews on Yelp and if you have to make a reservation on Sat/Sun to get a sandwich it better be damn good!....and oh Man, it was damn good! The only problem is now I have to go back and try the 80 other sandwiches. I had the "FORTY?!" (chicken fried steak, honey mustard, cheddar cheese on a Dutch Crunch roll) for lunch today. DELICIOUS! Ike seems like a super nice guy and I love how you can play Trivial Pursuit while you wait.
I'll have to join the throngs of Yelpers that are singing the praises for Ike and his great sammie shop in the Castro. It's a small hole in the wall, with seating inside for 5 people tops, with another table outside, which is great on a sunny day like it was today. It took me and my coworkers a little bit of time staring at the vast menu and trying to decide what to order. I finally asked the lady behind the counter what her favorite was, and she said hands down that it was the "Backstabber." The Backstabber is a mix of chicken, artichoke, caesar dressing and melted provolone cheese on a toasted garlic sourdough roll.My coworker ordered a Super Mario, which had meatballs. Ike broke the news to him that they were out of meatballs. I thought this was kinda odd, but Ike explained that he basically buys ingredients as needed. He has small supplies of things on hand, and on days where certain items are popular, they run out early. That made sense, and I appreciate the emphasis on quality.Which brings me to another point. Like other reviews have said, it's not the quickest place. It took us a good 20-25 minutes to get our three sandwiches. We didn't mind, but if you're looking for a uber fast lunch, this ain't it. But damn, when we finally did get our sandwiches, they were undoubtedly some of the best we've ever had. My Backstabber was a gooey delightful mess. My friend ordered seasoned fries with his sandwich. In hindsight, I should've ordered them instead of my chips.  My friends loved their sandwiches as well, although we didn't talk much during lunch....we were too busy eating.Ike has a good thing going here. The only thing that might keep it from truly exploding onto the scene are the limitations of the one man operation.....then again, maybe that's the point...keeping things simple by taking it slow and concentrating on a great product rather than seeking notoriety and big volume sales. I can dig that.Ike, I will be back. There are still dozens of things left on the menu that looked good. Keep up the good work.
Easily the best sandwich I have ever had. There is a reason the last time I went the wait was over an hour long (this time we chose not to go). I've had several of their sandwiches, and yes, they are big. Each one comes with an apple caramel pop at the end. The dirty sauce is very dirty. I ordered extra dirty sauce one day and felt it was overkill. I get a sandwich called going home for thanksgiving- or something like that. I get it with that srich.. sauce.. not sure on the spelling. Amazing. I can't wait for the one in SR to open! Yes, more expensive than Safeway sandwiches but, more flavorful and tasty. Plus a lot bigger. Plus, you all know SF has the tax to provide for health care to the workers. Who can argue with that?
This place is so epic there is only one thing wrong with which is finding a way to order all the samdwiches at once. I suggest the superman challenge or the M.I.L.F., or the super mario, or the fat bastard, or the super fat bastard, or the manage a trois! See wht I mean amazing but hard. Be careful though, there are roving bands of hipster kids that will take a picture of u with their slr or stand in line and swoosh their hair in ur food. So creepy!
I cannot say anything that has not been said already, so I'll keep it short...This might be the perfect hot sandwich. I just finished a Tony Soprano and am already thinking of reasons that I need to be in the neighborhood of 16th and Sanchez tomorrow.
Here's the scene: It's just after midnight on New Year's Eve at my place, I've had too much to drink and way too little to eat. Suddenly, two friends arrive, with cute girls in tow but more importantly, a mysterious brown bag. It's from Ike's.I unwrap the sandwich and take a bite, and suddenly everything slows down. Voices and music seem far away, because now it's just me and this delicious sandwich. After two bites, I wipe the tears of joy from my eyes and tap my friend on the shoulder. "You really need to try this," I manage to whisper, as I pass her the sandwich. She actually gasps after her first bite, and it's only her clear enthusiasm and bliss that keeps me from snatching it back out of her hands, and screaming, "Mustn't eat the precious!"I mentally note a new #1 resolution for 2008: Go back to Ike's as soon as possible. and I have. And it was again great.
I also had to check out Ike's based on Man vs. Food. I even drove to SF from Oakland just to get Ike's since there was so much hype and Yelp gave it 4.5 stars out of over 1200 reviews! I've been there twice now...the first time I had to get the Kryptonite since it's what Adam Richmond had on the show and I gotta tell you it was well worth the $18. I had to eat both half's for two separate meals since it was so huge. The second time I decided to go with a good meatball sub so I chose the King Koopa. I gotta admit, it was by far the best meatball sub I've ever had!! I might even have to get the King Koopa again the next time I decide to go to Ike's.What's great about Ike's is that they wrap ALL their sandwiches very nicely and real easy to consume. I really hate big sandwiches that are too messy when trying to scarf down. You have to try this place if you like sandwiches of any kind!
This place has THE BEST sandwiches in SF by far. I love trying a new sandwich each time, and have not been let down yet. Although there is always a line, that is a good thing btw, it is well worth the wait. I like the comp sucker 2. I would say it is time for ya'll to open up a few other locations around the city. :-)
Amazing sandwiches...seriously messy, but completely worth it. These guys need to find a permanent spot because they have to stick around. I'm definitely returning.
Anyone who know me knows that I love a sandwich as much or more than anything else in my life. In fact, anything that I love as much as a sandwich is surely better immediately preceeded or followed by a sandwich. I love the 16th and Sanchez... first off is there anything better than avacado? Not much right? And this sandwich is avacadolicious. With shredded chicken, cheese, and an amazing dutch crunch roll... having never been here before, frightened of the rumor of block long lines, I waited for 2:00 on a weekday, and now I know that I need to quit my job or find a new job that will allow me to be there every weekday at 2:00 until I've tried every sandwich. This is the best sandwich in San Francisco, hands down. Easily in the running with Mr. Pickles (San Mateo not San Francisco) for best in the Bay Area. Well done Ike, I'll be back again and again...
No doubt this place is trendy and delicious. We happened to live a few blocks away from the original location and went there when it just opened, pre-hype.Unfortunately, we hadn't been back since, bit I made a visit the other day.Ordered the Lincecum and I was not disappointed.Sandwich was amazing, but the price was a bit steep for a sandwich.While I highly recommend this place, definitely not a budget sandwich option.
LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. I cannot get enough of it. They alway seem to have the perfect combination of items in their sandwiches. Most of the time, when someone says they dont love it, its because they tweaked the sandwich in some way. I cannot say enough good things about Ikes Place. I work in SF, live in Redwood City, and visit the South Bay almost every weekend. What do these places have in common? There is an Ikes in all three locations! Just about everybody I take there, gets instantly hooked. In fact, now that I have been thinking about it for so long, I think that is what I will have to have for lunch. If only they delivered... =[
i've been here a couple times and thought the options were amazing but  several ingredients don't justify a delicious sandwich. everything is just kind of thrown together and the bread could be way better. would probably eat here again (not of my own accord) if there wasn't a line and this was the only option (or a friend really wanted to go). originally three stars, but took away one because of the annoying lines and groups of 20-something year-olds having fashion fights.
One sandwich from this place makes you wiser. The sandwiches really have a unique taste to them. A turkey sandwich from Ike's isn't just a regular turkey sandwich that you get at a deli. Buy a sandwich, take it to a bar, have it with a favorite pint and you're golden broseph.
There are 2 sensational things about Ike's Place. Number One is the sandwiches. OH MY GOD!!....warm, big, tasty and flavorful. It's the kind of sandwich that when you take your first bite, your eyes close and your head tilts back and a giant smile comes across your face. Suddenly you are taken back to your first ice-cream sundae, your first sip of a really great wine, your first hot pretzel, your first time having sex....ok, maybe not your first time having sex and maybe I've overshared...sorry. The second sensational thing about Ike's is Ike. What a wonderfully charming and friendly guy. He always has a smile and a warm greeting for you when you walk through his doors. If this were "Cheers", he'd be Sam and you'd be Norm.
Ike proves you don't have to be a Top Chef contestant or a Food Network star to open up a smashing sandwich shop in SF. I went in for the first time today and ordered a "Joan of Arc," which was a limited edition sandwich, but not limited in its taste or the amount of meat within! As I studied the menu, the very helpful cashier told me his favorites and described what set apart each sandwich. Meanwhile, a skater who'd only moments ago taken a digger walked in and said he was getting a sandwich before he headed off to the hospital to get his aching arm checked out. I guess he felt the sandwiches were that good - good enough to delay his medical attention.Plus, who doesn't love a sandwich when it comes with a lollipop?
OH-MY-GAWD!!! Overrated! I wouldn't go out of my way to get this sandwich. Maybe everyone just hyped it up too much on yelp that I was expecting this euphoric experience once I took a bite into an infamous Ike's Place sandwich, but much to my dismay, I didn't get what I hoped. The sandwich was OK.
I love this place! Its not just a sandwich shop, its an addiction...be warned once you have Ike's there is no turning back. I love how the bread is half baked, so when you order it they finish it just for you! I recommend getting anything with Dutch Crunch, and roast beef. My favorite is the Nacho Boy!This is a must if you ever stop and just look for a bite. It's very useful to call in ahead of time if you know what you want.
The best sandwich I have ever had in my life! A friend and I split the Mario World (or so I think its called) sandwich and we both loved it! It had just the right amount of sauce. I can not wait to go back and try another kind! The only bummer is there is no place to sit and eat!
This place is ridiculous. In the best possible way. I had heard rave reviews, so had to check it out...see what all the hype was about.RIDICULOUS!I was on the road, so didn't have the online menu handy, but was able to use the few working brain cells left to remember one of their signature subs.... the Super Mario (Meatball Hero w/ Mozzarella cheese sticks inside...yes mozzarella cheese sticks INSIDE). I called in my order, and when I promptly arrived 30 min later, my sandwich was fresh out the oven, receiving its final touches. I drove home salivating, hoping it was 1/4 as good as the hype.It was RIDICULOUS!My new goal in life, aside from traveling the world and meeting the woman of my dreams, is to try each and every sub on the menu.Whatever you are doing right now...stop...call a cab, get off your ass and walk, or get in your car and go to IKE'S PLACE RIGHT NOW.Did I mention this place is RIDICULOUS!
The Kyrptoniiiiite! Kryptoniiiiiiite! Oh lord. It's so good. I thought to myself, "oh Shannon, this is just a kitschy thing to attract tourists and sandwich enthusiasts alike, it'll be no more tasty than any other sandwich, and probably less tasty than some". I was wrong! This sandwich has supreme flavor and texture, with pretty much everything offered on the menu magically smooshed between bread, it's a wonder I got any aspect of it in my mouth, but once I started, I couldn't stop. A guilty pleasure to share with only the most intimate of friends, go forth and die happy.
Seriously they have the most amazing tasting sandwiches in the universe. They have anything fit for your liking & they really fill you up! And to make things better you get chips & a caramel apple lollipop with your sandwich in a paper baggie...I don't know why, but I just think it's cool :] But yes, the sandwiches are good, the vibe of the place is good, everything about it is just awesome. Definitely a must try if you're visiting SF!
Okay, I'm not much of a Sandwich person. Generally I find them to be boring and bland. Despite that I decided that a place with a line this large must have something good, so I walked over and ordered a Nacho Boy on a dutch roll with all the fixin'sSure enough, that was the best sandwich I have ever had in my entire life. I might have to reconsider my whole "sandwiches are boring" thing.The 100% health dept score is also very reassuring for such a "hole in the wall" place.
best most creative sandwich place in sf. the staff is always very friendly and fast for the crowds that surround this place from open to close. sandwiches can be pricey, but they are large and worth it . . . and hey it is the city. My favorite is the lex luthor or kryptonite. the combination of so many different ingredients works and always, always get that sandwich extra dirty
The most delicious. Once I get the thought of an Ike's sandwich in my head, my mouth and stomach take over, and I SIMPLY. MUST. HAVE. IT. What other sandwich pwns you like this?!My fave: veggie Backstabber with pesto. Holy bejeebus, get in my belly!
I was a little confused at first when I went to Ike's with a friend who had raved about it. . . it looked like it was a total whole in the wall . . . well it kind of is but thats what gives it it's charm. The first bite of the first Sandwich (the Tony Soprano) made me think they had put hallucinogenics in the sandwhich to make me think I had just taken a bite out of the best sandwhich ever mad. . . then I went back the 2nd and 3rd and 4th time . . . either I am now officially a druggy and need to join AA or they really are the best sandwhiches that I have ever had in my 26 years on earth. My only recomendation would be for them to come up with a buy 10 get one free punch card as then I would get a ton of free sandwhiches with how often I now visit that place. And yes there is usually a wait so go with the calling ahead if you can.
Came here the other day with my bestfriend and her sister. We got lost for an hour so I phoned them to guide me. They were super chill and friendly about it. I ordered a sandwich that had the basics of BLT on it, but I forgot what it was called. It was good. My friend ordered the 'Wakiki(?)' and another one ordered 'What's my girl's name(?)' and they both said it was good. I heard they used to have drinks with their sandwiches, but I guess not anymore since they moved locations; therefore, complimentary with a bag of chips and 3 lollipops (apple &caramel (: ) per sandwich order. Sandwiches are about $12? Alright size.
I've first heard about this place from my bf's older brother and he told us we should definitely go to this place since their sandwich is slammin'. Since we stayed in the city the whole weekend we planned to stop by for lunch before leaving the city--I figured after running a half marathon I could totally pig out on some delicious noms. Anyway, we got there and we saw a line about less than 10 groups waiting, which I have expected but I heard they take orders fast. I just didn't expect it to have no indoor/outdoor seating at all. I wouldn't have mind that but today was down pouring. We were determined to get our sandwiches and patiently stayed in line and it went by fast. It took 15-20 minutes from the time we ordered to when we got our orders--really fast considering they bake the bread from the time you order. I got menage a trois with bacon and the bf ordered Nacho girl and Veggie pride of Castro street. I literally said "Oh My God, this is soo delicious" after my first bite (and so did my bf's sister-in-law, not sure what she ordered but it had mozarella cheese sticks in it). My bf and his brother thinks their sandwiches are delicious but weren't sure if it was worth waiting in the rain. Since this is the best sandwich I've had (store/restaurant bought cos' me and the bf makes mean sammiches :-)), I definitely think it was worth it. I would recommend this place but will not go there again on a rainy day.
My fantastic day started at the the ATT ballpark -- watching my Giants sweep the A's; however, by the bottom of the 8th inning my friend and i were mentally waiting in line at Ike's Place for our delectable sandwhiches! =]] When we finally got to Castro we spents nearly an hour searching for a parking but we decided we have invested way to much time to call it quits now! Not to mention every time we passed Ike's the smell was taunting lol Alast a parking spot right on church. We got there and there was nearly no wait just enough for my friend and i to make up our minds she got [name of the girl im dating] and I got the 1/2. Spiffy Tiffy. Sandwiches here are made to order so its perfect and piping hot! Man oh man was it worth our parking journey!
Ok, I've upgraded my stars because #1, I went back a 3rd time to try it again and also because Ike sent me a message and offered to make my experience better. Don't get me wrong, I do like the place, I just am a little hesitant to pay the price. I was hoping that 3rd time would be a charm and it was. I ordered the Barry Z, which I swore I would NEVER buy a sandwich named after ANY Giants player (I don't care that the won last year, I emphatically DISLIKE the giants!) but my 2nd favorite sandwich is Turkey/Avacado. I have to say that it was very good! Although I've make a mistake 3 times now with "stuffing" the sandwiches with either onion rings or mozzarella sticks. It's not worth the money and it really doesn't enhance the flavor. The code problem still occurred (three times no working code) but I'm pretty sure I'll go again.
AHHHH-MAZING sandwiches. After seeing Ike's Place on Man vs Food, we HAD to try this place. We were not disappointed. I ordered the Menage A Trois and the Husband ordered The Damon Bruce. The flavors worked well together. Loved this place so much that we wanted to go back the next day. Would like to see this open up in Southern California sometime soon.
we came here on new year's eve/afternoon and waited in line around 330-445pm. sure we griped a bit about the wait, but we had good company so that always makes anything bearable. approach ordering rolling valet. a lady all the boys inside referred to as "mom" took orders and she was very sweet.i ordered the not tonight, i have a headache and it was so good. i'm not a big sandwich person but i have to say that this sandwich with it's semi-crispy fluffy bun and that aioli that they smother in that thing is worth trying it at least once. just don't go waiting in line by yourself. you'll be bored. i think my sandwich came out to about $8. during that time, i got a bag of chips and a soda [i think the happy hour deal has ended as of the new year]my bf had a sandwich that i don't recall but he was also incredibly happy, as were his 3 friends [1 who is a vegetarian]. we figured out that calling ahead is the way to go here. there isn't really a seating area except for 2 tables outside that seat about 2.5 people per table, and it's like a 1 hour wait even if you call sometimes.
i LOVE LOVE LOVE ikes' sandwiches, but i am giving them two stars because they've really ticked me off. a few weeks ago, as i show up to grab my sandwich, they tell me that they're charging me extra for chips. ...but i don't want chips. i just want the sandwich. apparently, the chips are 'so popular' that they just went ahead and began including them with most of the sandwiches and then charging you for it. what the f, really?? i feel like that's really disrespectful to your customers, especially when your stuff is pretty expensive to begin with; my sammich came out to just under $11. if ike's wants to make some kind of meal deal, fine, but give people the option of just getting the goddam sandwich. it really rubbed me the wrong way, and i've decided to boycott. at least the one in sf. anyone know if the redwood city one pulls the same crap?
CRAZY good sandwiches! I've tried several and all have been fresh and delectably good.They could use a hand from a managerial perspective, however: separate line for phone orders (so you can grab, pay and go); a more organized approach to taking down someone's order, having them pay etc. Place seems to be constantly packed, and LONG wait times are common.
Words don't adequately describe to you how much BETTER a sandwich tastes when the chicken is real, having been plucked from a plump, lovingly marinated bird vs. the ubiquitous pressed chicken roll we've come to expect at other sandwich joints. For 6.95 you get a very large, stuffed and messy, exceptionally delicious sandwich. This Is Amazing.UPDATE: Tried the Pride of the Castro and, dag-nabbit, this one rocks too! The ham and turkey combine with a lot of cheese and ooey-gooeyness to create an exceptional sandwich!! More Kudos Ike!!
Way to go Ike! A good success story after some hardship. I really enjoyed my sandwich (Nacho Boy) and my bf enjoyed his. I don't live nearby so waiting in line forever after trekking across town just isn't going to cut it for me. I'll go if I'm nearby or if it's off-hours.
I've been waiting so long to try this place out & I can honestly say that Ike's truly lives up to the hype. Just check out their menu.. ttp://www.ilikeikesplace.com/meats.html. Their service was freakin' awesome too.. I drove 45 minutes on a rainy Sunday, paid $4 toll, waited about 25-35 minutes in biting cold to place my order, Dirty Sauce? Hell Yes please! Then another 15-20 minutes to finally sink my teeth into my perfectly made #12 on Wheat.. Heaven. Another 7 minute journey for some Haight St Shopping & call it a perfect Sunday afternoon. Sandwiches FTW

Love the dutch crunch with extra dirty sauce and the ginger lemonade! The lines are super long so phone in orders are the way to go!
I always stop here when I am in the city. The last time was during the move and I was loosing my mind not being able to find it. The Dirty sauce and all the choices blow me away each time. I like that they offer so many choices I can go as big as I want.
Would you like some sandwich with your special sauce?
Well I'm one of many that says this but this place is amazing the sandwiches are out of this world. But super awkward temp spot they have right now at Lime. Looking forward to when they relocate!
Ike is the man!!! I placed my order over the phone while I was biking back from Sausalito. When I got there, I lost my credit card, so I had no way to pay.Ike said "No problem, just pay me later" WTF?!?!?, I can't believe my luck! I wolfed down the Super Mario sandwich like crazy. Way tasty.I came back later on that night to pay him, he was still there hard at work. Since I was there, I ordered another sandwich, The MILF with extra dirty sauce. It was very good as well.Needless to say, Lunch and Dinner at Ike's was the bomb. Thanks Ike!
Love Ike's!!! Only problem, there isn't a SoCal location yet :( With a toddler we can't just drop everything and drive 700+ miles to the Bay Area or we would! When we are in the area we go at least twice. If you're reading this, Ike, PLEASE consider a SoCal store! I echo many others when I say it'd be a hit! Till then, we can dream!
2nd time goin to ike's.i ordered a #9. Name of Girl I'm Dating. Well, I'm a female, so I just ordered the #9 with dutch crunch. Inside was Haal chicken, avocado, cheese, lettuce, tomato. I got the Sea Salt and Vinegar Dirty chips. The sandwich cost about $10.84, which is okay, but it's not that reasonable. (You should check out Little Lucca's in Daly City! It's the bomb). Since you can't eat on the sidewalk anymore, and there's barely space to sit inside, my friends and I walked 3 blocks and sat near the Castro underground station (there are chairs and tables you can sit at!)Ike's is good stuff and all, but it's a little overhyped and just a bit pricey compared to other sandwich stores.Pros: i like how they update their FB page frequently, and sometimes they post that they have free sandwiches, but I can never get em :\
Pros: Best sandwich I've had in San Francisco (Lincecum) - just as delicious as Giordano brothers but less intense of an experience.Cons: No seating; expensive for a sandwich (but worth it).
My friend and I couldn't decide what to eat so he brought me to this place. The exterior was really nice (really loved the sign). However, parking was horrible!! He circled around the block so many times. Each time he passed by the place I would just stare at all the people eating outside.. (It was already 2pm and I had not had anything to eat yet).Sorry, it's a pretty long review (by my standards)Anyways, so I ordered the cheesesteak (I think?) It didn't have any flavor to it. I tried really hard to like it since there were so many people waiting in line and stuff. While we were waiting in line I noticed that everyone tried to order the meatballs but they ran out. I guess I really did just order the wrong thing. I definitely want to give this place another try. Next time I'll get the meatballs.
I usually don't give 5 stars after just one visit, but wow... this place is good. I got the #1 (everybody knows when you don't know what to get, you get the first thing on the menu) and it actually took some time for them to make it even though there wasn't a lot of customers. But the wait was definitely worth it; my sandwich was fresh, it was tasty, it was filling, it was just... really really good all the way around. I don't know how else to explain it, you just have to try it. The workers are friendly too; you'll get to like them real quick just like you'll get to like their sandwich real quick.
Found out about Ike's a while ago and decided to go try it. I've been pretty much hooked since. My favorite is definitely the Change sandwich, and I pretty much order it every time I decide to eat there.I do have some gripes about Ike's though. It's mostly the wait time and the area the place is in. If you don't order by phone, expect to wait at least 20+ minutes depending on the day and time. It's also extremely hard to find parking as it is in a very populated area so bring someone with you so you can idle. The sandwiches are pretty expensive, but Ike's pretty generous with the coupon(s) that come out every month or so, so that's great. I'm planning a visit soon, so I can't wait to enjoy my sandwich, the free bag of chips, and a lollipop for dessert.
Sandwiches are good 1-5 (3) service 1-5 (3) messed up my orders 2 out of 4 times Drinks 1-4 (1) very expensive (can buy same drinks down the block for $1) Waite time 1-4 (1) very long lines and long wait time over all I give the place a( 2.5) out of (5)
Can't get over how good this place was! The SF Giants sandwich was SO GOOD! The dirty sauce is amazing.
Growing up the product of suburban sprawl, I'd learned to distrust the quality of any eatery within a two-mile radius of home. I didn't live near a downtown, so my thought process became: "Near food = bad. Far food = better as distance increases from my house."Ike's has taken that assumption and slapped it around like Bobby Brown on uppers. I live a block away from Ike's new establishment, and the concept of vegan sandwiches THIS good--and this close to my chosen residence--completely baffles me. I may have to start questioning other axioms in my life now, as well, just to make sure.Selection is not an issue here, whether you be omnivorous, vegetar-ious, vegan-arious, or otherwise finicky. The shop is cozy enough to fit four tables, a front counter, an ice cream bar... and a rear wall completely plastered with sandwich options. The decor made it seem like Ike was creating on-the-fly, too: new concoctions were posted in 8.5x11 paper tiles wherever space allowed. Hitting the lunch rush might just give you enough time to decide, if the line was long enough. As it was, my friend and I arrived during a period of quiet toward the evening, and stared in awe for several minutes while Ike helpfully offered up his favorites.Ike himself--along with his lovely assistant, whose name I'm afraid escapes me (due to my awful memory and no fault of her own)--stands as the reason a place like this can't be replicated. He's friendly, he's personable, and he's creative enough to dream up scads of sandwiches one can order either with or without animal, with essentially the same deliciousness. He mentioned to us that he had run a successful catering business beforehand, where no doubt he was able to dream up much of what he makes today. I can't imagine, though, that he could be at home anywhere but at a storefront like this. Putting a wall between Ike and his hungry public seems wrong, like reading Walter Kronkite transcripts. It doesn't do the man justice.Complaints? Not many. In my eagerness to try Ike's sandwiches "as they were meant to be eaten," I made the mistake of accepting the avocado in his Chicken & Honey Mustard sandwich. I KNOW I hate avocado. My friend's vegan meatball sandwich, though, was terrific. I'd wager it may be better than the meat equivalent, and that's from a guy who loves his meatball subs.My great fear is that Ike's Place will become such a success that we collective clientele will wear Ike down to the point of exhaustion. He's there from opening at 10:30am to closing, and it makes me wonder just how superhuman he can be before collapsing under a pile of French loaves one day. Just don't make that day soon, Ike. That new red chef jacket gives you even more "super" cred than before.
Add one more fan to the huge and growing legion. This almost closet size store front dishes out great sandwiches, service, and fun. I have a strong belief that their sandwiches are a "cut above" due to the ingredients beginning with great bread (especially the dutch crunch and french bread). The eight of us all gave thumbs up to our choices. Here were clear winners:* Paul Ruebens Sandwich (switch out the corned beef with pastrami and stick with garlic dutch crunch),* Tony Soprano,* Barach Obama,* Seafood Melt (for non-meat types)I also would have to say that the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff exceeded my expectations. Great experience. I would love for them to lease out a bigger space and have more tables...but that might hurt the personality and charm of the place. My friends and I will be back!!!
If i was to die tomorrow, An Ike's sandwich would be the last thing i would eat. It's crazy how large their menu is... The wait is super long... and this is place owned by some guy from Millbrae? There was a sandwich on the menu called the Mills Vikings. HRmmm!!
Well sheezus, I had to give this place a try after all of the mind-blowingly positive reviews on here. And, I am pleased to say my 'hood sports a pretty sweet sammich shop. I was totally jonesing for a turkey BLT and Ike delivered in spades. Mine was fresh, super flavorful, and perfectly sized. I was totally tempted by other offerings on the menu and will be back.Having said that... In good conscience, I have to dock ya one star, Ike, just for the delays others have cited. I didn't really mind waiting 15 minutes for my sandwich. I mean, I can tell you really put some serious craftsmanship into it. However, by the time my friends met up with me, the wait was up to 45 minutes. Perhaps it's a good thing that you're that busy, but it's time to hire at least one more person in the kitchen.
Third time's a charm because I got lost in the Castro the first two times I tried Ike's. The vibe here overflows with positive energy, and the community really shows love. I met Ike himself yesterday-- a wonderful, sincere dude. The sandwiches, of course, are fantastic. The Legend of Zelda, Barry Bonds, and the Nacho Boy have all tickled my fancy. AND, I was present for my homeboy's solo attempt at the Superman Challenge. The only negative thing I can say is that there is no seating, which hurts because Ike's sandwiches are so hot and saucy that they do not travel well. Maybe that's something to look forward to when Ike's relocates in the city. Best of luck!
Damn fine sandwich. You better watch out for my JRT he becomes ferocious for the chance at your Ike's sammich.
This place has ridiculously juicy and big sandwiches like the ones you see on t.v. There are so many different choices and they're all made fresh to order. Place lacks seating and parking is hard to find on crowded streets near castro. Nevertheless, definitely worth the hassle.
The absolute best sandwich I have ever had in my life. I could go on and on about the dirty sauce or the wonderful sandwich design but all I am doing is keeping you from going and as you read this the line is getting longer and longer.Just get there early wait for it and and then savor it.Don't try to order outside the menu and don't change the combinations they have worked so hard to perfect.Ike is the nicest guy in the world and always takes the time to talk to customers and answer questions. I want to move back to the east coast and steal this business model.
Best sanwiches on the westcoast!!!!
Came here because a friend recommended it and man, the sandwich i ordered (Mama's Chicken Huda?!) is REALLY good. First time i felt happy i couldn't finish all of it and took some home to eat later.Their milk shakes are also pretty good (me and my buddy ordered one each and both liked our choice). And, I was pleasantly surprised that their service was great; I asked any questions I wanted and was given their recommendations etc.Their 'dine-in' area is definitely on the small side. I can see how it'd be crowded by one or two groups of peopleBest Place for a Sandwich in the city.
I've been to all three of the Ike's Place locations in San Francisco. The first time I had Ike's was at its first location on 16th Street. No line at all. Then they moved to Lime's and there was a little wait. Then I just went to their new location on 16th Street next to Tangerine. There was hardly a line. Usually they're more crowded on weekends. During the week days, there's hardly a line. All three times, I loved it. I've had the Tony Soprano, Menage A Trois, We're Just Friends and Spiffy Tiffy. Their sandwiches are around $10 each. Big enough to share or swap halves with a friend if you want to try different sandwiches. The Tony Soprano has a lot of meat. The Menage A Trois and We're Just Friends is more on the sweet side. Goes awesome with the Dutch Crunch. The Spiffy Tiffy is more on the meat side also. The chicken they put in the sandwiches is not dry at all. Each sandwich comes with a bag of dirty chips. My favorite flavor is the funky fusion. Also, they put in caramel apple pops in the bag for a good dessert since the sandwiches are so filling already!At the new location, they have two tables by the window so there is very limited seating. I would recommend walking over to Dolores Park if it's a nice day, because it is a perfect picnic location. If you don't want to wait, just call in and place an order. That way, you're guaranteed minimal wait. As for parking, it's street parking but 16th street is not that bad on a weekday for non metered parking. If you're wondering if Ike's is worth it for its hype, I would have to say honestly no. But that's because people make it seem like it's gold. They make great sandwiches but I wouldn't wait more than half an hour for it. Luckily I've never had to wait more than 20 mins, so try your luck!
Ike's is the shit. Plain and simple, fantastic food. It's the type of place I take my out of town friends. Sure, theres gonna be a wait to get your food, and of course a single sandwich costs about ten bucks, but that's almost part of the charm.PZ BURGER: Awesome. I have no idea what the P and the Z stand for, but I don't really care; the burger still tastes good. And the fact that they sell Dirty Chips makes it even better. I'm not really sure about why people complain about this whole interim Ikes @ Lime business. Think about it this way guys: IKES IS STILL SERVING! Sure, you have to order your sandwich while a bunch of bro-ey looking drunk people are dancing to LMFAO at 1:30 in the afternoon, but think of that as free entertainment while you wait for your little piece of heaven wrapped in between a slice of bread
Great friggin sandwiches and fries. Their vegan and vegetarian menu is drool inducing and extensive. And what the heck do they smother on their French loaves? It has a savory, buttery flavor encrusted into the warm, toasty bread. Just madness. Complete sandwich madness.Make sure to order ahead since it gets crowded quickly and the outdoor seating is very limited. Sandwich. Madness.
These sandwiches are for REAL. I recommend getting the Menage a Trois. The sandwich isn't bad either... ;) Definitely call ahead with your order to bypass the line.
After waiting in line for over 1 hour then another 40 minutes to get my sandwich. I went home to eat because there is no place to sit, when I got home they gave me the wrong sandwich. What a joke.
Ike's, you've changed.I used to be an Ike's superfan. I happily waited in line for hours to get one of your sandwiches. But in the last few months, my husband and I notice that they're just not as good as they used to be. Can't quite figure out what changed. Everything seems just a little less awesome. The lines are still long, but it's not the Ike's we once loved.
Wow! Awesome sandwiches. Wow!I couldn't believe this was so high up on the list for all of SF, but we tried it anyway.Great sandwiches, great service (really nice employees), great! It's a little hole in the wall place, but you will not be disappointed!
i can't believe i have not written a review for this place. i don't need to write a long ol' review. the proof is in the pudding, and the hundreds of reviews speak for themselves.innovative, delicious, and countless selection of different sandwiches. it's worth the wait, or call ahead if you're impatient. you can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches!
Best sandwich I've ever had!!!! Sooooooo good. Plus the customer service was exceptional.
You must try this place!You must go back!You must try something new!Excellent-Supurb-Outstanding!!!!!!
Dear Ikes: I want to wrap you up and take you home to MA with me. I met you last summer and you were the best thing that ever happened to me. I ordered the Thanksgiving turkey sandwich and it was amazing; the house sauce really adds to the savory flavor of the sandwich. It also came with chips and a lollipop and was cheap to boot. If I come back to visit, I will surely come back, if only to try one of the 80 other sandwiches they offer.
New yummy sammiches in the workhood. Three cheers for yummy sammiches. Hip-hip-hooray! Hip-hip-hooray! Hip-hip-hooray!Many, many choices. Many of those choices have bacon on them, yes.Standard run of salads: Thai Chicken, Buffalo Chicken, Chef, Cobb, Caesar, Garden.Veggie and vegan sammich options. Oh, and the kicker. Milkshakes!I have seen this spot be many odd things in my time on the block. Most recently 16th Sweets Ice Cream Parlor, and Mac's Gifts (The Keychain, sticker, and performance fuel additive place). None of these places kept regular hours or were open very long. I hope this is not the case for Ike's Place.Ike is kind and gleefully makes your yummy sammich.I wish Ike the best of luck with the shop.
Wow - I don't know how we lived a block away from Ike's Place for so long without trying it out. Every other business that's been there goes kaput within 6 months, so when we saw a crowd of people outside and the "reservations required" sign in the window a little while back, we were shocked.Hands down the best sandwiches in the city - the only drawback is the wait. I'm still waiting for the special bat-phone line for the regulars. The pizzle is probably my favorite - how can you go wrong w/ bacon and ranch? And the Tony Soprano is perfect for a carnivore like me. The fries are good, though a bit unusual, and dipping sauce is a nice touch. I'm definitely missing the milkshakes, though - hoping they fix the freezer soon.
These subs are pretty good, but it is not worth the 40 minute wait to get them. They have lots of vegetarian and vegan options, but the wait really kills it for me. Great food, crappy service.
Great neighborhood, non- chain of a place for sandwich. Laid back attitude of the staff yet great service.Quality of food is superb.
gotta be honest... my expectations were a little high seeing all the 5 stars for this place. we can't let "man vs. food" skew our perception here either... there's a little bit too much hype going on, but still decent.everything on the menu sounds amazing delicious and fun. i had the MILF, the gf had the Pride of Castro. the sandwiches were not nearly as big as i expected them to be, and they seem a little slopped together. the MILF was drenching in sauce, and pretty much anything tastes good with loads ranch and hot sauce, i could definitely make this for you in my kitchen for about half the price.2 sandwiches (comes with chips and a sucker) plus 2 sodas came out to $25 and change... :/ little pricey but not necessarily a deal breaker.we called in the order to avoid the line (would recommend) but still had to wait about 45min to pickup, PLUS, wait in a short (and unmarked) line along with other pick-up customers. if you call in your order, wait on the right side of the register.i think i'd give it another try on another nice leisurely afternoon, but most definitely would not come here if i'm already hungry. again, decent, but a little over-hyped. no sign of ike in place either, ike where you at?!
These are some serious sandwiches. They're all ginormous and all sorts of extraordinarily saucy. Be sure to grab napkins or get ready to get sauced up. Grab a sandwich to share (two orders can comfortably fill up three people) and when the weather's looking sunny, make your way on over to Mission Dolores to take in this beautiful city. For normal days, I recommend the menage a trois or the [name of the girl I'm dating]. But for those days when you're feeling up for the challenge, check out Doomsday with roast beef, corned beef, pastrami, turkey, bacon, ham, haberno salsa, mozzarella sticks, stuffed jalapeno poppers, and extra jack. Yes, it is give or take five pounds (equivalent to the size of a small baby), and yes, it may or may not be a heart attack smacked between two slices of bread. It's a $20 sandwich, so it's not for sandwich amateurs. For the sake of your wellbeing, please share it. It's literally equivalent to the size of two normal sandwich orders so it is actually about the same unit price. By the way, whatever Ike experience you go for-- get the dutch crunch for your bread choice; it has the perfect texture and is beyond words tasty. Have fun Ike-ing.
The sandwich is so juicy!!!
By far one of the best sandwich spots in SF. Went here with a friend who recently turned vegetarian and heard rave review about how this place was so veggie friendly.Walked into the little hole in the wall and was bombarded with most obscure names for sandwiches. So feeling a little overwhelmed asked the cute sandwich boy behind the counter "Whats your favorite?" His pleasant reply was the Menage a tois. Feeling a little adventurous I took his advice and ordered the kinky sandwich. To my delight it was fantastic, messy but fantastic. My friends sandwich was just as delighted by her vegetarian option as well. My only advice sit while eating, have lots of napkins and enjoy!P.S they serve you a lollipop with every sandwich for dessert really cute touch!
Tried this place for the first time yesterday - yes it is the truth!I had the backstabber sandwich ($7.97 currently on the monthly specials board). Shredded chicken, artichoke hearts, caesar dressing and cheese on a garlic sourdough roll. The balance of ingredients was perfect, moisture content was on point, & service was extremely friendly (I even got complimented on my shoes)Without a doubt I will be returning and even making appointments for my w/e sando fixIke-you put out a phenomenal product
This place is the bomb diga deee!!
i had the "kryptonite"... which i couldn't find listed on their website, but was told it's the "doomsday" PLUS pesto, onion rings, and a few other goodies. not only was it the size of a small child, it tasted amazing. this sandwich destroyed me, and i'll never be the same again.
I came here after I heard about the "Matt Cain Championship Edition" winning the Best Fan Sandwich Contest. The sandwich was rich with flavor (secret sauce). The mozzarella cheese sticks and avocado went well in this concoction. So many different flavors I felt like I was at a buffet.  I wanted to share it with my girlfriend so they were nice enough to cut it in half without me asking. Half a sandwich was decent size for 1 person but you won't be full. Service was very friendly, place was clean, and wait was about 5 minutes (I ate my dirty chips while I waited). There is enough room for 3 couples to eat. Usually a seat opens up while you wait for your samich :)It's only downfall was the price. $16 for a single sandwich is ridiculous.  I would buy this all day if it was $8-$10.
The best sandwhiches I've ever had in my life! I love Tony soprano and the Barry b and z. With pesto! I go there pretty regularly because nothing Ive had can compare with the juicy goodness of these wet hot sandwhiches dripping with their secret "dirty" sauce. The service is great and Ike is a realllllly nice guy; he always remembers my friend and I and is super accomodating. Love love love ike's place definately go there!
Yep yep, incredibly delicious. If Quizno's needs an inspiration, Ike's would be it or him. I thought of Quizno's sandwiches because Ike's sandwiches are hot and uses a combination of sauces. I tried two of their sandwiches, but now I can't remember which ones. I know one was the 2nd on their board and the other had something to do with Elvis? Anyways, it's true you have to stand-and-eat. But if you're lucky to get a parking spot close enough like me, you can take it to your car and eat. My experience eating an Ike's in the car was particularly memorable because a dog walker happen to be walking this cute french bull dog and another car by my car. The french bull dog decided to just plop down on it's butt in front of a house, apparently because that was his/her home and he/she thought it was time to go home. The dog walker lady was trying to convince the cute bull dog that they had to keep walking...maybe to pick up more dogs for her route? haha
DiRTY SauCE!!!!We arrived around 2pm for a late lunch on a Tuesday. It was my lucky day because I stumbled upon VIP parking (Allow time for parking). Holy ShiT was my first thought! The line was out the door with 6-8 huddled around the entrance waiting for their order and we quickly realized we might not have anywhere to eat but inside the car (There are only 2-3 tables. Outdoor. On the sidewalk). When we got our sandwiches a couple was getting up, lucky!  There are like a bagillzion sandwiches on their menu. Some on their menu, the wall, the chalkboard. How to choose? What to pick? 15mins of contemplation goes by and I chose Christina and Umair Goes to Ikes on wheat bread: Turkey, Bacon, Ham, Salami, Italian Dressing, Avocado, Provolone. This sandwich is out of anyone's comprehension. The flavors, meat, and veggies meld together impeccably for a bite of perfection. Its a taste of heaven. The dirty sauce comes on every sandwich as it should! That spread is killer! They need to bottle and sell it. I want the DiRTY SauCe on every sandwich for as long as I live. So goood!! Also they bake their own bread and it isn't baked until ordered. Therefore, increasing the wait time but well worth it.Definitely returning!!! Yes, Man VS Food was here! Note: Second location in Redwood City opened recently.
Out of all the places I went in San Francisco, this was the top stop on my edible adventure. I had a Fat Bastard and it was everything a hot sandwich should be. The employees where super nice, worked fast, and easy on the eyes. The line was long, but for food this good, it can never be rushed and the wait can be overcome by phoning in ones order. Oh Free chips and a caramel apple sucker.
SImply the best sandwich in the area....Personally I recommend the Matt Cain, as the combination of the meats with the Godfather sauce can be defined in one word: divine.My son goes to Mills High School, and we were all bummed that Ike's is no longer coming to Burlingame. I do not hesitate in saying, though, that the wonderful sandwich is worth the 15-20 minute drive.
VEGANS! You have to get here ASAP. In addition to his regular menu, Ike has a SUPER long list of vegan sandwiches - meatball subs, breakfast sausage sandwiches, turkey subs, grilled cheese... oh man, I could seriously go here every day. And it's really hard not to, living right across the street. Total comfort food. The melted vegan cheese he puts on everything is killer! Look up vegan-friendly in the dictionary and you will find Ike's smilin' face. He's there every day and has a real hands-on approach, cares a lot about his customers. My husband and I were a couple of his first vegan customers, and he experimented on us a bunch - even made his own secret vegan dirty sauce. Try it on your breakfast sandwich! We love this guy, and want to support his awesome business. There's no other sandwich shop in the city that has this many vegan options.  Convenient to public transportation.
YES THE RUMORS ARE TRUE:This IS the best sandwich ever.I had the Nacho Boy on a dutch crunch roll... It was super delicious. The bread was perfect, the roast beef was extremely high quality... Love the staff too! Yeah, there was a wait for the sandwich, maybe ten minutes or so. But sweet Lord, it was worth every second. They also made half for there and half for us to take home-- a great idea cause it was massive. And delicious! BEST SANDWICH   E V E R.
Not to be the broken record on this topic, but the meatball sandwich I had was at a level that I never thought sandwiches could be at. I got the Super Mario, which essentially is a meatball sandwich with a FRIED MOZZARELLA STICK shoved in there. I didn't know this type of heaven existed. I couldn't finish the whole thing in one sitting and had the second half the next day. Soon after I took a nap and dreamed about meatballs and dirty sauce.My boyfriend had the meatball sandwich in the vegan version and had the same amount of love. This coming from someone whose usual sandwich repertoire includes pack after pack of Tofurkey slices. We both wanted to get the sandwiches the next day for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.I rate them 4.5 stars because parking in scarce in the area and the sandwiches take a little long to make. The wait is worth it, but maybe not worth the ticket for double parking.
Love it or hate it its still an obsession hah!We were on a trip from Austin Tx to San Fran and while I had very little luck with service in the west coast Ikes actually did great! Yes it was a weekend- BEAR WEEKEND in fact in the Castro but he squeezed us in. Thank you! I do believe that it does have an unusual way to run things but if you can get into the groove- then enjoy the sandwich.. i did!
I paid 14 dollars for a sandwich that i was to pick up at lime, at that price cant they afford a heat oven to keep hot sandwiches atleast warm????? If you think people should pay 14 dollars for a hot sandwich only to find it cold, thats a shame
Really incredible vegan sandwiches.Get 'em to go, walk to the park and have yourself a savory date with a beautiful lady.Try the Meatless Mike! Mamma mia!
Ike's is truly amazing. I went there today with my boyfriend based on the fab reviews it has received on Yelp! of course. I ordered Lizzie's Lips. Perfectly grilled chicken, pepper jack cheese and italian dressing. They offer all the fixin's on their sandwiches, lettuce, tomato, peppers, onions, pickles... also a great selection of bread. There is a wide variety of drinks in the cooler as well, and you can get chips or fries as a side (for extra). They give each customer a tootsie pop for dessert, which i think is a pretty awesome, yet hokey finishing touch. I adore this place, and will for sure be making more visits there. The only thing I could say that is a negative, is that the actual shop is itty bity, the line goes out the door when there are only a few in line, and there is only outdoor seating, 4 folding tables with two-4 chairs each. So if you're planning on dining here, be prepared to wait. It's best for togo orders, and since it's so close to duboce park, might as well get it wrapped up and enjoy the sights over there.
AMAZING! I had a HUGE sandwich for lunch and I'm still full. My new favorite sandwich place. Can't wait to go back.
I dropped by on a Friday late afternoon and after scanning their vegetarian/vegan options, I ordered the Purple B's Vegetarian California BLT with vegan cheese on a wheat roll. I got my sandwich in around five minutes - not bad, I thought.I pick up half of the sandwich and took the first bite: hmmmm. Second bite: mmm, mmmm. Third bite: mmmmmmm, mmmmmmmm, mmmmmmmm.Was it the crispy fake bacon, fresh avocado, pickles, lettuce or soy cheese causing that delicious ruckus in my mouth? The fresh bread that seemed slightly heated could have been a culprit too. Wow, I thought - this was some really good stuff. I was hooked.As I finished the last of the sandwich, I made a mental note to myself to come back and try every vegetarian offering available. I figure I've got all Spring, Summer and Fall to accomplish my task - I'm looking forward to it!
I can see why this place is so popular! They offer a huge variety of sandwiches which are bigger than life! Come hungry. A sandwich is big enough for two! Seriously. It's monstrous! So far, I have tried the MILF, the BLT, and bites of the King koopa! Don't come here if you are on a diet! But even if you are, who cares! For you vegetarians and vegans--don't be afraid, there is a huge menu for you, too! Worth the long line!
You simply can't live in SF and not do Ike's... It's all about the dirty sauce.
Sometimes I'm sad that it's almost TOO easy to get Ike's... but naaaah, I ain't complaining!! All you have to do is call, order, and pick up at the time you specify. That easy!! Sometimes I wish there was even a line to pick up the sandwiches, just so they will taste that much better, but nope- not even a line at 12:30pm during lunch hour. However, they STILL taste scrumptiously good. I find them extremely mess, especially if you've let them soak up for 30 min, but outrageously fun to dive into. My favorite is the menage a trois with all the veggies, exxxxxxtra dirty and on a dutch crunch. Sadly, the prices went up slightly, but hey they threw in a bag of awesome chips. Now that there's no line, you have no excuse not to try it out!!
The only reason that Ike's gets so many high ratings is because of hype-beasts. I've only been once. the food was decent, but the line was friggin ridiculous. got the food around 530PM. ate, thought it tasted something like subway but without the parmesan and herb bread, so it was a lil' disappointing.about 2 hours after eating i got massive diahrea and projectile vomiting. i was in the bathroom for the rest of the night and until 6 pm the next day. i say fuck this place. if you like it, good for you. if you're going for the first time, dont fall into the hype of all the ppl that rate it 5 star instead of 3 because everyone else is doing it. i wish i could take stars away from ikes.
Messy deliciousness.... The cute girl at the front made me laugh, and then recommended the "backstabbed" sandwich. I have been stabbed in the back a lot over the past few years, and not one of those times has ever made me as happy as this backstabber sandwich has. It was most huge. I ate half when I got home (with the tasty tasty fries with honey mustard dipping sauce) and I am eating the other monster half now. these sandwiches are mother f'n tasty. Joder. Plus the girl was really cute. I like her... maybe like like her. I just finished the sandwich, and now I am sad. Le sigh.
Wow.Like so many others, I've heard rave reviews and had high expectations. Finally checked out the place today- only a few blocks from me- and I am in a food coma bliss. I got the CA-BLT with everything on it on sourdough bread- which makes me think of the clich phrase "toasted to perfection". PLUS- I was pleasantly surprised by the happy hour deal- 4-7- free chips and a drink. Oh yeah- and they put some free candy in my to-go bag. Best sandwich ever. I will be going back, regularly.
OMG! so good! i just realized that i never wrote a review for this place, probably because there are already a gajillion reviews. but, i wanted to mention again that the sandwiches are made with HALAL chicken!! so yayyyyyy for people who eat halal meat -- we can enjoy these delicious sandwiches too!!
After seeing it on Man Vs. Food I had to try it. The first time I went there the line was pretty long, like I was waiting in line for a rollercoster. So I figured this place must be good, and it was. With the unsual names and number of first time customers made it pleasent. Although ordering it on the phone is a differnt story... I do not recomend! I got hung up on twice. They were extremely rude, and it took abt 2 1/2 hours till I could pick up my order.
Did you ever love a sandwich so much that you were afraid to eat it, because then it would be gone?Tried Ike's for the first time today. The ordering system, though requiring a little planning, didn't bother me at all. Since I am currently on crutches from knee surgery, the thought of waiting a half hour wasn't too appealing so I called in an order for a Barry B. (turkey, bacon, swiss) on dutch crunch. They said 3:15 (exactly 1/2 hour after the time I called). I drove over, parked halfway up the block and crutched down to Ike's. Before I was even in the door I heard a voice call out, "You wouldn't be Gary, would you?" Amazing. The clerk even walked my order to my car so I didn't have to struggle carrying it. Great service.What about the sandwich, you ask? Exactly what I wanted, nothing I didn't (they even slightly hollow out the roll so the sandwich isn't all bread, and makes it easier to handle), everything tasted fresh and their house sauce is great!!My first time, yes, Won't be the last.
I had an ex-g/f with bacon. Great sandwich. A little pricey for that and a drink plus chips. Glad this place takes credit/debit cards. Could use a place to sit more than their bench. I definitely want to try out all of their variations.
Dirty Sauce! That's all I gotta say for now!
Came here on a Saturday to try since I usually see a long line here. Got in line and was waiting for a bit... didn't bother me too much since I was playing Word Scramble! I guess they offer free samples of their sandwiches since some guy came outside and offered everyone in line one... funny thing is that it's a regular half sized sandwich. I was tempted to grab one but I was pretty sure I'd be close to full after it... so there would have been no point to buy a sandwich! LOL. I didn't want to be THAT guy that got a free sandwich and then walked off... so I declined my free sample. hahah. 5 minutes later a guy walked by with some chocolate too.. I declined that as well. Wait was probably 15-20 minutes. Ordered the Matt Cain and waited another 10 minutes afterwards to get my sandwich. It comes with free chips and a lollipop. Pretty cramped inside and it's pretty loud... luckily the worker shouts your order out pretty loud, otherwise I wouldn't be able to hear. Meal was decent but it wasn't exactly what I expected. It seems pretty ordinary, I guess it's the sauce that makes it stand out the most though. For a $10 sandwich, I expected something extraordinary... it just felt short or over hyped I guess. Definitely worth trying though.
There's not much more we can add to what everyYelper has already said. So here's a few of our suggestions:1) Try any of the cheesesteak sando, but take away the cheese and replace with jalapeno poppers. You're welcome in advance for that.2) Call in ahead of time because they do take awhile in completing your sandwich. But hey, they don't bake the bread until you order! So mos def, it's worth the wait.Naysayers may say "nay"... but we say it's the BEST sandwich we ever had.
I love that through the power of yelp, a tiny little sandwich shop has become so popular that they need to take reservations! I finally made it to Ike's and I can see why. Not only is the food awesome, but Ike and his staff are so personable, kind and truly concerned that you are enjoying your meal. I went with the yelp favorite, Meatless Mike - made vegan style with the new Vegan Mozzarella they ship in from Teese in Chicago. The cheese was really good for soy cheese. The roll was the perfect combo of crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. I made a huge mess but it was totally worth it!As a vegan, I'm not usually faced with having to choose from so many options! Next time I'll be trying the Piglet - vegan riblet with bbq sauce. Ike says they'll be discontinuing it soon (not sure why) - but suggested I try it soon, that I'd like it. I hear they have more menu options online than up in the store b/c Ike posts them online as he creates them. If you go on Saturday or Sunday b/w noon and 3 be sure to call and make a reservation or order ahead.
Sweet, they opened their new SF location just around the corner of the old one.
I'm going to have to side with the 800+ 5 star reviews. Went here Saturday afternoon with a group of friends, and all of us were beyond impressed by our orders. I typically like a very plain, basic sammich, the the Backstabber (#30) was an amazing change. Marinated artichoke hearts. And that miraculous dirty sauce. Never had a better sammich. Ever.Go here. Go now. Order up.
I finally tried it... And yes it's worth both the search and the wait. Many people can say it's just a sandwich, but I'm sorry folks, it's THE sandwich. The only other sandwich joint that could compete is King Food Submarines on Divisadero and they don't have an ounce of the choice that Ike has. It's awesome but be prepared to wait.
Hands down best sandwich spot in SF. Great options for vegans and non vegans, so I would definitely recommend checking this place out! Also check out the iPhone app to help avoid the lines. You can pay for your food from your phone and just walk right in and pick it up without having to wait in a line that could be out the door.
Be very very hungry before considering Ike's. I arrived at 11:30 and a line had formed. It is best to phone in your order. The girl at the podium taking orders was very helpful and guided me as it was my first time. I ordered the Peg Bundy, Breaded Eggplant, French Dressing, Avocado, Smoked Gouda on dutch crunch bread.....In hindsight, the french dressing should have been eliminated by me (too sweet). After ordering the wait time was 20 minutes. I took my sandwich to Dolores Park on a crystal clear blue sky day...Heaven. The sandwich was very rich. I finished half. The bread was exceptionally fine. The eggplant was perfection.
It's sad to hear that Ike's got booted from their original location. On my last visit to the city, my sister drug me to Ike's @ Lime. We called in our order and waited a few minutes in the nice and bright lounge space. The selection of sandwiches on the menu is amazing! I split the sandwich with my sister and it was one of the best sandwiches ever! My only complaint is that there was the Eau de Bar (sanitizer and booze from the night before), but at least you know the place is clean! The story of Ike's Place and its growth is quite amazing. The staff is very attentive and friendly! I only wish I had a place like it near me.
Um, wow! These are super tasty sandwiches.I've gotten the Vegan Combo and the Vegan That's Too Bad. I love their dirty sauce (is it just veganaise? I need to be in Veganaise Anonymous). They chop the lettuce nicely and it's not crummy iceberg. Definitely call in your order so you won't be waiting.I'm thinking of getting a bunch of these for my monthly potluck at work so people understand how good non-meaty things can be!
Only went there once, but the sandwich was everything everyone said it would be. Big, salty, the right proportion of meat and veggies and all that jazz.the super secret fries were delicious and Ike told me they are air baked which means they're not all fatty and deep fried. He claimed only 8 grams of fat for the whole large (and i mean large) bag. Friggin awesome.
YUMS!! and you get a lollipop with your sandwich!(the reservations are reservations not to wait. my average wait time without is usually only 20-25 minutes anyway, and i've only gone days between friday and monday)
WOW! Read reviews a few weeks ago and was finally in the neighborhood. With all the great reviews, I was expecting a great sandwich and boy did they deliver! The Paul Reubens was yummy. My wife had the That's Too Bad - declaring this was the third best day in her life (the first being the day we met, the second the day our kids were born, and third the day she had her first Ike's sandwich!).Great selection, fast service (we called in the order), and wonderful sandwiches! I already have the next order picked out - Do you Smell What Barack is Cooking.
Rollin out the 5 stars is never easy. But with Ike's, I have to say it seems like a breeze. Vegan's are never given the chance to enjoy meatball sandwiches and poor boys... but at Ike's vegans and meatatarians are treated equally. The sandwiches were large, filled with "meat" and "cheese" and toasted. I assume the real meat sandwiches were also pretty stacked. But i am ego centric and only worry about my vegan ways. The only bummer about this place is it's proximity to hipster doofuses. I counted at least 3 fixed gear bicycles outside. Also it closes kinda early, like 4:30 on the weekdays, with the exception of Friday. So if you have a real job, its a bit lame. All in all, I cant speak highly enough about Ike's, its going to be a place I frequent as I start my all sandwich diet.
This place has one of the best sandwiches that I've had in awhile. We bought a total of 4 so we could have some variety. Out of the 4 that we bought, the best one was the "Nacho Boy." Second place would be "Jeries Big Meat sandwich," third is "Name of Girl I'm Dating," and bringing up the rear is the seafood sandwich.They have their own sauce called the "Dirty Sauce" which is pretty good. The meat portions is good and so is the bread selection. I would come here over Subway anyday, you can't beat the $6.95 price either.We came on a Saturday afternoon and it was packed. I think it's worth the trek to the Castro.
it's hard for me to decide which I love more, Ike or his sandos.Either way- it's a win win.I had some Thanksgiving there and I will never ever forget it. Much better on a sandwich & without your whole family fighting.So glad I met you Mr.Ike and The Sandwiches, your my favorite band.
Now i know why this was the 2nd most yelped reviewed place in the united states last year, not only was the sandwich i got (The Matt Cain) with jalapeno poppers on it freakin amazing but it came with a free bag of chips! almost never happens at sandwich shops, It was also surprising how many vegan and gluten free sandwiches they had available, the menu was overwhelming for me being it was my first time there. A must have in SF
Believe the hype. Solid sandwiches. Tried the Menage a Trois and it was better than any Menage a Trois I've had in the past. Juicier. More tasty. More fun. Desert at Tartine Bakery and all is well.
This place reminded me of the hilarious episode of the Keys to the VIP show where a guy starts munching on a sandwich while picking up a girl. The oddest approach to sandwiches I've seen, due to the club-like atmosphere. I had the menage-a-trois with bacon. It was quite meaty, messy, and I very much enjoyed it. However, I'd have to say it wasn't the best sandwich that I've tasted. It didn't bring out that 'wow' factor that I had expected from anything worth a rating of 5 stars and named a menage-a-trois. Maybe there were other sandwiches that I could have tried (they have over 30), but that was what I picked after watching some tv show with some random guy raving about the menage-a-trois. For a better sandwich at a better price I would try Morty's Delicatessen. Parking is atrocious so stay away if you don't feel like driving in right turn circles for very long.
Better then your average sandwich. Prices are definitely not comparable to what you would get at Subway. I ended up getting the Jeries' BIG Meat Sandwich and paid $12. Only drawback is the wait. I was literally there for 30 minutes waiting on one sub.
Awesome sandwiches. You can get the run-of-the-mill variety or try one of their more creative options. Anyplace that attempts the risky jalapeno poppers on a sandwich combo gets my full endorsement.I heard about really long waits but went on Sunday around 1pm and only two people in line in front of me.Can we now just put one of these in every neighborhood?
25 minutes for a decent-but-not-great sandwich. Meh. I ordered a "Napoleon"-- turkey, poppy dressing, avocado, and havarti -- on dutch crunch bread. The poppy dressing was overly-sweet. To boot, they forgot the dutch crunch and gave me regular bread.
I'm in the middle of procrastinating on work right now, so why not freshen up the yelp reviews a bit. We headed to Ike's for lunch today and then to Delores to enjoy the grub.As for Ike's...Great area. Pretty decent sandwiches. Small room w/ 30 min outdoor wait when we were there. Surprisingly, even with dozens of people packed onto the sidewalk waiting around for 30 mins the person serving the food managed to have a stellar attitude. This really helped make the experience enjoyable. He even hooked us up with half of some lady's sandwich that he had been calling her name for around 20mins to pick up. As for the sandwiches...they were pretty good. Not outstanding like most people on here are going apeshit over but still solidly done. My "Damn Straight" (shredded chicken, marinara, fried mozzarella, tomatoes) was bland; just a little salt and pepper would've gone a long way. Other sandwiches in the group were chicken, bacon, avocado, swiss and a gardenburger. The free sandwich was roast beef and swiss. All food was good & well made, but not outstanding. Probably the best part is the serious bake-job on the sandwiches which melts the cheese perfectly and gives a perfect crispness to the bread.Sandwiches are around 3 stars for taste, but the service and quality actually moves it up to 4 for me. They have a huge roster of creative sandwich creations on the menu and the onion rings looked amazing, so we will make a trip back in the future to try out some other items.
what more needs to be said other than sandwiches from ike's is the shiznit!!we called in and ordered:- nacho boy supreme: delicious- change: super deliciousnext time i am going to attempt the lex luthor.that is all.
I've walked by this little hole in the wall numerous times in the past and never knew it was such a popular spot until I read the Yelp reviews. Sparking my curiousity, I dropped by the sandwich shop and picked up a couple of sandwiches for myself and hubby. The first thing that caught my eye was the sign on the window, which stated that sandwich orders on the weekends were "by appointment only". Apparently, the shop is so popular, people have waited for over 2 hours for a sandwich during peak hours on the weekends! Crazy...Anyhow, hubby and I both agree that the sandwiches are pretty tasty.
I was introduced to this place through a friend and was amazed with what I received. While I was initially skeptical of this place due to the prices, I was not even remotely disappointed with my sandwich. Effort is taken to ensure that the entire product is well made here, from the bread to the fillings and even the customer service. I worry that I might have to visit here every week if not more often!
Amazing sandwiches. The service is alright and the sandwich prepare-er guys are sort of obnoxious, but nothing can trump how tasty the sandwiches are. And I highly respect that the owner is out there pounding the pavement making sure his customers are happy. This is the best you can get in SF, by far.Fav: Meatless Mike. Mmm, vegan meatballs.
Unbelieveable! Dutch crunch is highly recommended.
YOWZA!Tried this place on a trip to san franny last week after seeing all the great reviews.It was soooooo good.I got the Bowzer which has meatless meatballs, marinara, jalepeno poppers, AND cheese sticks. It was so decadent! Wouldn't eat it everyday...or even every week..but a true treat!
This is BY FAR the absolute best sandwich in all of SF. I'm not even a huge sandwich fan but I'll always swing by Ike's for a bite. It was the line up the block that attracted me to this 16th street gem. My parents always taught me that the good spots to eat always have a line; and trust me, Ike's ALWAYS has a line, but it moves fast, they work quick and their service is superb. The sandwiches are HUGE. Often times one of their sandwiches becomes a 2 part meal which when on the go in the city is perfect for quick snacking throughout the day!
Amazing sandwiches! Definitely worth the hype. It just sucks that there is nowhere to sit. I found half a sandwich was more than enough, though I suppose you could save the rest. Love the menage a trois and bella sandwiches!
I know my 5-star review is probably irrelevant at this point, but good lord, Ike's. I dream about Ike's. I can't think of many places where I'm absolutely willing to sit and wait for an hour on dirty concrete just so I could eat.. but Ike's I'd do just about anything.I get the Pizzle, which is what I imagine God eats for lunch every day. Put some pesto on that thing and we're in business. Ike is super nice, the employees are all foxy and friendly and they have CHAI COLA there! So: five stars. Wish I could give it six.
Prepare to line up and wait ... for a super tasty sandwich. I usually don't like sauces, but the dirty sauce really distinguishes Ike's from other sandwich shops. Very creative selection. Highly recommended.
I SAW THIS ON MAN VS FOOD.... which is my FAVORITE food show.. its my fav because i dont watch anything else about food. anyways so i saw the SF episode and decided to try it.. Its pretty amazing and i guess i came at a good time. They call it "happy hour" and i got free chips and bottled soda, and these CARAMEL APPLE lollipops which were kinda random but verrrry nostalgic (ate them all the time in middle school). great experience i have to say... PS I'd like to thank Ike for making my sandwich too much for me to finish in one sitting... Later that same night (and very long night) of partying i came home to a whole half of sandwhich.. It was the sandwich that prevented me from having a HANGOVER later that morning... ahh.
Huge freakin' sandwiches!! Their selection of differ sandwiches made me stare at the menu board like a dumb ass. I finally picked a pastrami sandwich and asked for it to be "extra dirty" (extra dirty sauce). Waited about 12 minutes for the sandwich...then...HOT DAMN!! Now that's a sandwich!! It belonged in my face cuz it got all over the place...
Great Sandwich: Vegi-We're Just FriendsSandwiches I've tried, ranked in order of most delicious to least most delicious:1. Vegi-We're Just Friends (Turkey, Zesty Orange Glaze, Avocado, Pepperjack) - The Zesty Orange Glaze is the one man...the one!!!2. Chipper's Fave (Seafood Melt on French Roll) - There's something in that melt man.3. Jeries' BIG Meat Sandwich (Roast Beef, Pastrami, Turkey, Ham, Salami w/cheese) - Heavy as a m***f**er.4. Meatless Mike (Vegan Meatballs, Marinara, Pepperjack) - Good, but not as good as the three above.
"Name of the Girl I'm Dating"....great bread, love the honey mustard.....pure deliciousness.
So what if you have to make an appointment to eat here. Sandwiches this good deserve to be penciled in. Ike's place reminds vegetarians that sandwiches are more than just mayo, mustard, lettuce and cheese. Ike put life back into my 'wich!!
Delicious!! I went with some friends who live in the neighborhood. They got meaty sandwiches were they promised were delicious, and I got a special that was tacked up on the wall: a Dirty California Roll, or something to that effect. I forget the exact name, but it was SO GOOD! It was fake crab salady stuff served on a french roll with garlic butter, dirty sauce (some top-secret flavored mayo, so they told me) and loads of toppings including tomatoes, pickles, peppers, lettuce and onions.We were all licking our fingers clean and entirely satisfied. Good job Ike!
Seriously good sandwich
This is a sad day for me. I wish I'd written a review a year ago, when five stars wouldn't have been enough. But the fact is I've enjoyed my Ike's less and less with each location change. Today I was greeted by the same friendly cashiers and handed my sandwich by the same friendly Ike. But it turned out to be the first truly ordinary 3-way I've had there. Aside from coming on the wrong kind of bread (another first), it was kind of a lettucey mess that managed to be watery and dry at the same time. I can handle the occasional letdown (even at $12 a pop). But this is starting to look like a trend. Bummed!
Good friend of mine took me here this past weekend (she is a huge fan of this place). She had a BLT with fake bacon and I had the Philly Cheesesteak-ish sandwich. Great sandwiches, both(I had a bite of hers)! Yes, there is a wait, but very much worth it. Ike and his mom were great.If you like this place, you will probably like Bakesale Betty's in Berkeley.
Ikes is the best sandwich place ever. I Menage a Trois and all it blew my mind. The lines are long during lunch but well worth it. I am drooling over the keyboard just thinking about it. Yum Yum Yum.
Yah...even though I'm sure Ike hates me now...this place was uh mazin...We needed all of our sandwiches to be vegan...and I know that that must be a hastle...but they did what they could...their was five of us who got sandwiches and we were all so happy afterwards...I had wanted to come here all weekend...a really cute part of the Castro District is right around the corner...we sat by the colorful wall next to his store because it's so small but who cares...they made awesome food...and the sun was shining...shiny happy people we were...oh and then there were surprises at the bottoms of all of our bags!
Yep - hundreds - nay thousands of folks can't be wrong - Ike's makes some super frickin fine sammiches! At work we've pledged to work our way through the menu over the next couple of months. I started with the "Eli Manning" on a wheat roll. Dang! Tips:-Call ahead and pick your food up to-go-napkins are your friend, these are messy sandwiches-Halal chicken breast means shredded chicken-no clue what 'dirty sauce' is but it's tasty-the prices are high but you can get 2 meals out of one sammich
this is by far the best sandwich place ever! me and the bf went at 2pm ish and there was a bit of a wait but it was soo worth it!i got the hella fat bastard sandwich and it was amazing!!! and my bf got the doomsday sandwich. amazing also!everyone needs to go here when they get a chance its worth the drive and wait!
used to be da bomb, now they slather sandwiches w/ too much sauce... make my sandy w/ love (or else it'll be a one night stand)
I'm sold. Tried the Tony Soprano and Hollywood's SFCheesesteak sandwich. Both very different from other but delicious. I thought the combo of the 3 meats of the Soprano would have been too heavy: Turkey, Ham, Pepperoni..but it was a burst of flavors! I recommend the dutch crunch bread with any of the sandwiches.. Baked fresh and slightly crispy.Ike himself served us our sandwiches and had the best service I've seen in a while. The line was super long but went by very quickly. We'll definitely be back again!
the sandwiches are AWESOME!!!! the reason i give only 2 stars is because i paid with my debit card and later in the week i look at my online banking. one of his workers must have tacked on an extra 5 dollars for a tip when i remember not writing down a tip. sorry for no tip for an awesome sandwich but im a broke college student and that extra 5 dollars hurts.i will be back for more sandwiches but i will NEVER use my debit card here again. moral of the story, PAY WITH CASH PEOPLE!!!!
Nacho Boy Supreme is the Best Sandwich I have ever had. Yes they will have long lines because their sandwiches are so good. If you don't want to wait go Early or order it in Early. You wont be disappointed by this place.
Had some friends from out of town over and decided to give Ike's a try for the first time. Given our history of exaggeration and over-indulgence we decided to try the superman challenge: the doomsday, the Lex Luther, & the kryptonite.The sandwiches smelled great on the ride home and were huge and weighed a tone. However, not only did each sandwich have an insane amount of lettuce on it (half of the cross section was lettuce) but everything about it tells me Ike's is more concerned about quantity than they are quality. If you want a giant sandwich with a huge chunk of meat then Ike's is your place. If you want something that actually tastes good behind the meat, look elsewhere.
Damn tasty sandwiches. You might better off taking the sandwich to go, though, because the sidewalk is on a hill and you'll end up sitting at an angle at the tables outside... it's more obvious when you're facing downhill though. :PWhen it gets crowded, the wait can be a bit long to order and get your sandwiches, but the service is friendly!
Normally, I would wait and visit twice for 5 stars but the combination of great sandwich and incredibly friendly folks makes this a no brainer.Phenomenal for veggie (or vegan) subs and great combinations. Bread baked fresh.
the sandwiches here are disgusting and the place is really dirty. I just don't understand why people line up for sandwiches that have been made with dirty hands
Best. Sandwich. Ever.
So based on all the rave reviews of Ike's I had to try it out. And as usual the yelpers were correct!!I tried the meatless meatball sandwich... and as a carnivore slowly converting to a veg... I was very impressed. It was YUMMY!! Went on a friday afternoon at 4:30pm so my sandwich came pretty quick, no waiting in lines or anything. Service was excellent and I did meet Ike. Mos def a cool guy!! Thanks for the great sandwich i'll be back to try that flipper soon!
Yes I know...there is always a line to get a sandwich!But after my first time there, I can say the wait is all worth it..Delicious!
Best sandwiches in Sf. My favorite "Tony Soprano". Great choice of drinks. I hope they open one in San Jose soon.
There are 3 components that a sandwich must have to be successful: Good bread, good flavor, and moistness. And for sure Ike's has all three! My all time favorite is not unique, but the menage a trois on a french roll with the funky fusion chips is the best sandwich combo ever! Definitely recommend calling in your orders ahead of time unless you feel like meeting new people on the street, waiting in line. My suggestion is to grab a sandwich and head over to dolores park so you can eat it, fall into a nice food coma while basking in the sun, and then wake up and grab some Bi-rite ice cream. Sounds like a perfect, lazy Sunday to me
Ike's lived up to the hype. I ordered the Matt Cain and it was yum. The God Father sauce is delicious. You have to get there early (aka when it opens at 10 am) if you don't want to wait in line. They were out of chicken today... which I thought was really weird, considering we were the first in line at 10 am. The guys who work there are really nice and claim to know all 200 sandwiches by heart!
Halal chicken, their special sauce, sourdough bread, cheese and some chips. Who knew it could be the best lunch ever. Calling in the order was a breeze, parking...not so much. But it is well worth the parking spot search. Fantastic!
Overated. It was an overpriced sandwich. Service was cool for a stand in line- hole in the wall. I had high expectations, and as such, was given a big let down. Sandwhich was favorless and not very well put together. Maybe it was because I arrived before closing? I really want to be a fan. I'm gonna give them one more chance on the hope that this visit was a fluke.
Sandwiches make for the perfect, sun-soaked afternoon. In a recent episode of 30 Rock, Liz Lemon claimed all people aim for in life is to sit by themselves in a quiet spot and eat a sandwich. Well, she should have inserted the word "Ike's" before the word "sandwich." This place is no joke. When I first moved here I passed by it everyday on my way to the 22 stop at 16th and Church and would always note the blue sign and its appeal. I'd chuckle to myself and say: "Look that ole sandwich painted on that big blue woooden sign up there like a cartoon, that's silly." Eventually, as that particular route became routine, I'd think "Look at that sandwich, it looks kind of nice painted up there with all those jazzy colors and all those super fix-ins." And then it hit me: "That sandwich painting looks pretty delicious and I want it in my tummy sort of immediately." And thus began my Ike's experience. As a vegetarian in San Francisco, I am not at a loss for establishments with veggie options but a place that can turn any meaty dish into a delicious veg-dream, well that's the bees knees for me. My first order was the Meatless Mike (vegan meatballs, pepperjack, marinara) and it was terrific, like actual meat but not! I then turned myself onto the Vegan Sanchez Elementary and Veggie Menage a Trois. My current crush is on the Veggie M.I.L.F. because not only is it a delicious treat topped with Frank's Red Hot, I also feel a bit a pride repping my hometown of Buffalo, the origin of Frank's.Yes, the line can get long, very long in fact. But that is a business owner's dream and props to Ike for his place taking off as it has. Just call ahead, they usually always answer and if they don't, they call you back! If you're in the neighborhood and the line is long, don't be deterred, it's worth the wait and the customer service is above average. When ordering, the Ike's folk look you in the eye and you are the only person to whom they are speaking and helping, always friendly and curious how you are doing and how life is treating you. It's that little extra the Ike's crew adds to each of my visits that make it an establishment worthy of high praise. Liz lemon is right: my afternoon is complete with an Ike's sandwich, a grassy null in Dolores Park, and a little bit of peace. Now I walk to the bus stop and am proud to say I'm an enthusiastic patron of such a fantastic establishment. And I can guarantee you this: an Ike's sandwich will make any other sandwich you eat taste like a big blue wooden sign.
Rest in Peace Ike's Sandwhiches.. you will forever be missed! :(
After hearing rave reviews from everyone and their mom I just had to check this place out to see if it was true. The menu is extensive and it will def take you a few minutes to come up with an order. As for the sandwiches, they're delicious. I got the Elvis Kieth. The Elvis was an amalgamation of teriyaki chicken, tempura fried sushi and a classic American sandwich with an excellent wasabi mayonnaise paired with their dirty sauce. It sparked fireworks in my mouth! The only downfall is it's a tiny restaurant with only 2 tables.
Saturday brunch off the hook, bottomless mimosas
Ike's Place has inspired me to write my first ever yelp review... I am ashamed it took 4 years of living in San Francisco to discover these sandwiches. I had the Hot Mama Huda and it was honestly the best damn sandwich I have ever had (if you have an affection for buffalo chicken, I highly recommend). The neighborly service and recession friendly prices made for an overall excellent Sunday afternoon experience. Thank you Ikes, I will be back!
My friend kept on raving about the meatless meatballs, and so during one of our breaks, we drove over to Ike's Place. There's a school a block or two away that has parking available when classes aren't in session, so parking wasn't bad at all.Part of the fun of Ike's Place was ordering...there are so many options! I went down the menu that was posted behind the counter, and then my friend handed me a binder with the complete sub list....I was starving and stopped reading at #82 (review of sandwich below).The other entertaining aspect of Ike's Place was the action behind the counter. It was around dinner time, so they were swamped. Four or five guys were piecing together the orders...I see hands grabbing for mozarella sticks and bread...people rushing back and forth....it was just pure chaos...all to make the PERFECT sandwich...2/16/2009: I ordered #82 Not Tonight, I Have a Headache. Very good size--took two sittings for me to finish. The halal chicken breast was amazing...very juicy and well-flavored.4/5/2009: I ordered the Supermario. It was so amazing! Meatballs, mozarella sticks, marinara sauce, red onions, and pickles on wheat bread. The meatballs were so great! They're not in the typical firm ball-form, so it's not too messy to eat (unlike Subway). The mozarella sticks were great too! Eat it while it's fresh though! I saved the 2nd half for later, microwaved it, but it just didn't taste the same.
My husband and I came here for my Bday last week, on a Thur. We got totally lucky and found a parking spot right in front, and there were only 5 people in line. We both got a sandwich with dirty sauce, and a bag of the Voodoo Chips, and Cajun Dill chips. We then took it all to a park near by. The sandwiches were yummy, but not as big as they looked in pictures. We each deicded to eat the whole sandwich, since they were already kind of soggy. I LOVED THE VOODOO CHIPS!!
These are by far the best sandwiches in San Francisco. Ike's dirty sauce is very good and can't beat dutch crunch bread, so combine the two and you've got a winning combo. I tend to enjoy the fat bastard and menage a trois but it's all good. As for the dirty chips, great free food for the homeless and they can have the lolly pop too. 5 stars for the food, however the wait can be daunting at times. I highly suggest calling ahead of time and picking it up at your designated time.
Great sandwiches, great service, great prices! Ike's has the most unique sandwiches I have every come across and they all taste great! The special sauce truly is special! Best sandwiches in the Bay!
oh.my.god.you.guys.it's.so.good.I've been meaning to go here for a long time, after hearing about the meatless balls of meat. I was heading to work yesterday, and knew the meatball sandwich would be totally messy, and I'm prone to spilling... so I got the Vegan Combo which is vegan meats, cheeses and veggies. Normally I don't like vegan meats, but Ike's is very thinly sliced, so it doesn't feel like your chewing rubber. The cheese is kind of like ricotta, which is interesting but delicious.Next time I'll try the meatball.It's a little frantic and disorganized, phone's ringing everywhere., but it's all part of the charm i guess. Ike was wearing a Trader Joe's employee tshirt, which I think is just great.
What can I say! Love the sandwiches and obviously I am not the only one as there is usually a line up the street. Good service friendly service
Best place in SF!
Picked up my free birthday sandwich from Ike's Place! Thank you Ike! It was great and it always seem to taste better when it's free! Still wish you had tables for customers to sit and enjoy their meal. I'll be back and not just before my next birthday.
I ate here for lunch today, and I guess I don't understand the hype.I waited 20 minutes for a pretty normal sandwich... It looked like a Subway sandwich, and tasted about the same, except it cost 25% more and the bread was vegan.If they can cut the wait down I'll eat here more often :)
2035 reviews can't be wrong. This place rocks. Particularly if you are sane, i.e. vegan. The only downside are the lines--but what can be done? Great restaurants have long lines in the city. Plus free Yelp trick--call in your order=no wait!Love them
Decided to come here for a Saturday lunch around noon. Probably not the best place given the always hectic parking situation in this area, but eventually found a spot. Upon entering the store, there was already a line of about a dozen people. The whole place seems to be run by kids in their 20's - had a very San Francisco vibe to it. A menu on the blackboard lists at least 30 sandwich options - hard to absorb at first, but I guess, having to try many options is the gimmick. I tried the 1/2 and the Nacho Boy (oddly named, as it seems to have no nacho resemblance). The chicken halal of the former had an interesting texture and flavor - kind of like dry pulled pork, but seasonably salted - very nice. The roast beef of the latter wasn't as good, was overpowered by the mayonnaise. Otherwise, the sandwiches do have very fresh ingredients. Each was served with some Dirty potato chips. They also have a fine selection of root beers.
I heard Ike's closing day after tomorrow. At least according to their web-site so even though I had to study and tons of other things to take care of, I decided to grab my roommate and grab my last Ike's (at least in a while) sandwich. I ordered the "Big Meat", #26 and it was soooo good. Who doesn't like a sandwich packed with meat? Who doesn't like anything stuffed with meat actually? *snicker*
Quite an amazing little sandwich shop actually..it is very reminiscent of San Francisco. They have a large menu and will mix and match anything that you want. Vegetarian and Vegan friendly. We had the Corned Beef sandwich and the Bacon Avocado Turkey Pesto (not sure of the numbers) on Dutch Crunch which they are famous for. The sandwiches were a work of art and without a doubt the best sandwiches I have ever had the pleasure of eating. We waited about an hour total to place our order and receive the food...I would have waited 2 hours because it was that good. We will definately go back. Price was about 10 bucks per sandwich and you get a bag of chips with it. Must see. 5 star Shabam!
I'll admit I only went here because it was on Man vs Food. But, it was great! My boyfriend and I loved our sandwiches. The line WAS freaking long. We called in and the wait was 3 hours O_O. But, it was also a couple weeks back when they were about close down. So, maybe I just caught a really bad day. However, I'm on the Ike bandwagon now.
Ike's is worth the trip. Street parking is impossible, there is no seating indoors or out, and you will wait up to an hour at times to order and get your food. All things considered, I will still say this is the best sandwich shop I've ever visited and one of the necessary food stops in San Francisco.We had the SF Giants and the (Name of the Girl You're Dating). Both were incredible, eyes-closed-while-I-comprehend-how-good-this-is delectable. Go on a weekday around happy hour time, and they will throw in a free soda. A free bag of chips and a lolipop come standard.Just go.
The publicity surrounding this place is annoying, and the wait is way too long. If you like a hipster scene, you'll love waiting in line for this sandwich, other than that I found the sandwich I got overpriced and greasy. I am not sure what the dirty sauce is, but it appears to be a greasy mayonnaise type sauce. I think the hype is better than the sandwiches.
I think all the Yelp hype is slowing killing this place.I bet most of the new 5 star reviews are from people that never went to Ike's Place years ago when it was really good.The atmosphere was great so charming and the sandwiches amazing.I was one of Ike's Place biggest fans from the day it opened but not so much anymore.What with the long long lines and the 3 hour order ahead baloney it's just simple not worth it.My sister and I recently ordered 2 meatball sandwiches 3 hours ahead after being told that's how long it would take.Ike was just leaving as we got there and as soon as he left half the staff started screaming how they hadn't had any breaks.It was getting ugly like an LA sweatshop I mean sub shop. One of our sandwiches had been made wrong by them and the cashier says to my sister next time order the right way.It wasn't her fault.It was their mistake because their so busy making everythinglike a fast food shop.After all this bull we ended up with 2 cold soggy overpriced meatball sandwiches.Why don't they just move to a larger location?I'm sure my new 2 star update will be placed way behind some of the old 5 star reviews since Ike's Place is a Yelp sponsor.It's sad to say but Ike's Place has become another version of a Subway . Maybe they should rename it Mc Ike's.....
Don't know how I feel about this place yet. Tried the number 7 (The Pizzle) and I wasn't impressed. The sandwich came with Halal Chicken Breast, Bacon, Ranch, Cheddar lettuce & tomato. Sounds good right? Not!!!!! I only ate half and gave the rest away. Next I want to try the Super Mario. All Beef Meatballs, Marinara, Mozzarella Sticks, Pepper-Jack.3.5 stars until I go back
The last thing Ike's needs is another amazing review - still, I just can't help myself. I don't know what the man puts in his sandwiches but they are oh ohhh ohhhh ohhhhh soooooo damn good. Yes, you have to make an appointment. You just need to get over it. Otherwise you will be denied what is arguably some of the best food in the Bay Area (and I'll have an easier time making my appointment....hmmm). All I can say is the Ike's 'witch is definitely greater then the sum of its parts. Pick-up the phone and call now....P.S veggi meatball rocks, so does the veggi lets just be friends Enjoy!
5 star sandwich, every time. I cannot think of one instance when I took a chance on a sandwich at Ike's and was let down. From Vegan Jokers to the Chickeny Menagiatois (sp?) you can never go wrong here. For 10 bucks I get two sandwiches! They're so big I save half for later. And I can't forget to mention the Dirty sauce - perfect name because that sauce is diiirrrty. AMAZING. If you visit San Francisco, Ike's is a must!
Run, don't walk. No really ... GO NOW.YES ... it is as good as they all say. Especially the 'Paul Reubens' (try substituting turkey for the corned beef), 'Paradise Found', 'Hot Mamma Huda', 'Menage-a-Trois' and 'Name of Girl I'm Dating.'The staff are fantastic -- very friendly and always ready with suggestions. This place is so flippin' good that not even the lack of indoor seating (there is none) gets me down. Why are you still reading this? I said GO!
This place has made my boyfriend and I the most boring conversationalists on the planet. As soon as we find ourselves within a two block radius, we have to tell all and sundry how good the sandwiches are. I wish I could think of something clever to say here, but I can't -- all I can think of is that nummy dirty sauce.And how much does it rock that vegans and omnivores alike can eat here, and come away with every craving satisfied? It rocks a lot.
I usually don't give 5's to any places but Hot damn this place was bomb!!! I seriously read many reviews on what sandwiches to get lol. I came here on a Sunday before flying back home to LA, for some reason me and my friend really wanted to be fat and just eat like crazy before flying home LOL.When we go there we saw the big menu on the wall and I thought they had more sandwiches, but then I looked down there was a menu with hundreds of sandwiches. Me, and my 2 friends ordered all 3 different sandwiches so we can taste all three since none of us have ever ate there. This is what we got.1. Nacho Boy - Hot Roast Beef, Mushrooms, Avocado, Swiss with wheat bread. Super good if your a Roast beef and avocado fan! the sauce they put in there is good as well.2. Matt Cain - which is there sandwich of the month I remember it was turkey but this sandwich was very saucey which was messy but very good! I like this one more then Nacho Boy.3. The Joker - All Beef Meatballs, Zucchini Sticks, Ike's Red Pesto, Ranch. This Sandwich was absolutely my favorite sandwich out of the the other 2 sandwiches. Very good, and its nothing like all those other meatball subs you get. Its not Miranera overload its so much differ and worth getting, probably one of my favorite meatball subs I ever had! Meatball sub loves must get this! trust me its worth it!!All Sandwiches are pretty much $8 and above but check out there site it will give you prices! The sandwiches are huge, and packed full of meats and goodies! Anytime and everytime I'm in SF I will definitely come back to this place! Ahhhhh finally I am done reviewing all the places I been to in San Fran! Also I met Ike him self!! Very cool guy! I think anyone that goes there will meet Ike, he brings out the sandwich for you and introduces him self! Now that's great customer Service! - Happy eating!!
Yay! I'm a fan.Many times I have walked past Ike's Place and wondered what the sandwiches would be like. Would they be as good as Estellas? Needless to say, Ike's has been on my list for a while and I finally bee lined there on a sunny afternoon. I ordered the eggplant marinara sandwich and traipsed over to meet my friend. It was hot and heavy to tote around, but oh so satisfying when I was able to sit down and eat that saucy mess. The marinara soaked through the bread but the top half of the roll still retained a nice crunch. I enjoyed my sandwich, enough to go back and see what else they have.
Dutch crunch + ANY of the sando combinations will leave you more than smilin' and you'll have enough to have a lil snack later! Besides, Ike is cute and so are the men of Ikes Place.
best sandwiches ever.need I say more?
It's all about the "dirty sauce" that turned a plain cheese and veggie sandwich into an "Ohhhh fuc" sandwich. Please pass me some more of that sauce.
Hands down NUMBER 1 sandwich shop in the city. WIth over 150 sandwiches all made with awesomeness and served between dutch crunch. Can't go wrong with Ike's sandwiches. There is a reason why there is always at least a 20 min line to order from this place. The sandwiches are damn good. I had a Menage A Trois. Fuckin orgasmic, just as good as the real thing. I definitely recommend phoning in your order if you don't want to wait in line. But the sandwiches are definitely worth the wait.
I went to Ike's about a week ago and I have to say TRY the Jim Rome!!The only thing I won't recommend is going at lunchtime if you are in a hurry because the line can be a bit long, but other than that the food was amazing. I wish I lived closer so I could go more often.I wish these could be opened up on all military installations so I can go to Ikes whenever I travel.
i guess i was in a bad mood the day i went to ike's - it's the only thing that would explain my yelp vs all the others i've read. i would say that i had great expectations which were not really met. i got the lead on this place from food/travel network. loving a good sandwich i had to go. the "ike's" i saw on tv, with all the fixings, was not the ike's i experienced (except for the long line and the intriguing workers). it looks like the menu may have been cut down in size after the show air'd on tv which was a disappointment.it was a pretty good sandwich, don't get me wrong. it was definately a cut above subway or any of it's mirror images. what was really neat is after we got the sandwich we walked just up the street to that little park by the library to sit down and eat it. it's always fun to sit in the castro and watch the people go by. but in the end i would have to say it was just okay. sitting in the castro made it better than i felt it was, getting ike's a 3rd star from me. if i'm ever in the city and need a quick meal, i'd be willing to call in and pick up a sandwich. but i don't think i'd plan an outing around going here again. it appears they've lost their shine.....likely the food/travel network killed what made them special.
It's rare to come across a popular spot that offers tremendously tasty eats, maintain a friendly atmosphere, and supremely satisfy stomachs of all capacities. Ike's Place will easily surpass your favorite food spots, making Ike's the number 1 choice on your mind, as it should be. The consistent high quality sandwiches, the 8 1/2 minutes you spend looking over their menu for the right sandwich (even though any sandwich is a good choice), and the cozy neighborhood location provides more than enough reason to stop by Ike's.My favorite is the Tony Soprano. If you add Pesto, you might just pass out from the deliciousness. But even without the knee-buckling Pesto, it still offers an fluid mix of flavors and awesome goodness.If you've got a big appetite, try Jeries' BIG Meat Sandwich, if you can sit up at the end of eating this bad boy, more props to you.The Super Mario will leave you breathless. Literally. Seriously, you might need to lie down for a minute afterwards. And if Super Mario has that effect, what do you think King Koopa will do???Check out the Paul Ruebens, but ask for a recommendation on the bread, I forgot which one is best for this sandwich. Although I'm an incessant carnivore, I did enjoy the Vegi-We're JUST Friends, Vegi-Going Home For Thanksgiving, Flipper, and the Dirty CA-Roll. Very tasty sandwiches and excellent alternatives on those days that call for lighter sandwiches.Simply said: Ike's Place Rocks!
Second time here. As good as first time. We'll make a pilgrimage now every time we come to SF. The Nacho Girl sandwich is incredible. Next time with bacon!
I am EXTREMELY disappointed that I have to review this with one star. The food is good, but EVERYTHING else is sadly lacking. The whole ordering process is horribly unorganized to say the very least. My friends and I hungrily came here on a Monday afternoon excited to try Ike's for the first time. We heard the line can be outrageous at times so we preordered our food on their iPhone app. Bad idea. It was a little before 12pm when we placed and submitted the order through. My friend's order stated the pick up time at 2pm while my pick up time was at 3:30! Wth?! We ordered the same time yet my sandwich will be made an hour and a half later? Anyways, we get to Ike's at 1pm and there was absolutely no line. We tell the cashier about our preorder and he tells us to wait in the lounge area and that he'll be right with us. We wait awhile and ask ourselves, "Did he forget about us?" So we go back to the front and ask him about our order again...he forgot about us. He then tells us that if we get in line (at this point a line has formed) we can order the sandwiches again and he will void our previous app order. Okay....what else were we going to do since we drove all the way here?...We irritatingly obliged. As we were waiting, people who phoned in their orders could cut in front of everyone. So people with phone orders had priority over people waiting in line no matter how long they've waited and people who have already ordered through the app? How the hell is that fair?? At least make a different line for phone and line orders! We finally get to the front of the line with our patience wearing thin. The guy tells us that he's already put our orders through and that it will be ready in about 10 minutes. Nope...make that another 25 mins after even more confusion. After waiting forever bc of the numerous mix ups, we finally had our food in hand. It was good, but with everything that just happened and all the unorganized BS, the food wasn't great.My experience at Ike's was a total nightmare!! I get that they are trying to save money by sharing the location with Lime, but at the same time they are giving little to no customer service. I will not be coming back ever again, that's for sure. And to those of you who say that their sandwiches are worth the long ass lines and unorganized bull, THEY ARE NOT! P.S. If my review has taught you anything, it is to phone your order in bc they seem to take priority and allow people to cut...
k so came here for the first time ever with the boyfriend, and we both agreed most definitely the yummiest sandwiches we've had in ages!!! They're famous dutch-crunch will not disappoint, and if your hesistant about trying new things like I am dont be, cuz let me tell yah some of the combos sound interesting and will definitely make you question whether you want to try it or not, but let me tell you it will be one of the best decisions you'll make!! Tim Lincecum sandwich is my absolute fave!!! I can go on and on about how yummy this place is but trust me you have to try it for yourself!!oh and can I just add everyone here is so friendly and welcoming!!!! and they are pretty quick too!!! I'm telling you once youve tried Ike's theres no turning back!!
Literally the worst sandwich i have ever had i hate this place i waited twenty minutes for a buff chic sandwich with no ranch and they gave me a ranch and chicken sandwich that's it the only thing i didn't ask for, biggest waste of time and money of my entire life never ever going back to this terrible place i suggest no one else does either............Also way too expensive for a tiny shitty sandwich.
One of the best sandwich establishments I've come across. Yeah, it takes a long time to get a sandwich but I have no problem thinking ahead and ordering ahead. Bread is fresh and delicious, and all meat tastes like it should live there. Hala chicken spiffy tiffy is what I would recommend to those first time clients. The specials are amazing if you start becoming an notice costumer. Thanks Ike!
This review is totally irrelevant because of the fact that this place speaks for itself. IT IS AWESOME! Even when i took the bf here who is a very hard food critic, he totally loved it. We loved it so much we came back the next day! wwoohoo.
trust me, the wait is worth it. there is a reason why everyone else is.menage trois: dangerously goodeli manning: hella goodthe chase: certified crack
Fun combinations. Fresh, toasty, tasty bread. All the condiments. And wacky names. With all of this goodness around, how can Ike's Place NOT serve up a great sandwich?!Even better is that you can definitely eat one in a sitting if you're really hungry, or split the difference and enjoy the other half a little later on.Ike's is definitely making my list of regular simple, fresh, sandwich spots. Worth the wait, and worth figuring out what you want.
Ike's place made the local news last month when their Castro location shut down due to lease issuesand over 300 people lined up for hours for their great sammiesThey recently they sold 1/2 off certificates which i boughtso i was going and it was a gorgeous dayafter spending a nice afternoon in nearby Dolores Park, which was packed due to awesome weather and full of life, I got hungry and resumed my quest...i kept looking and looking.. smart phone was dumb and made me go to the old addressand then new address... well it turned out to be some dance clubi had to do double takes on the Google search on my phone to make surethis was in the afternoon broad daylightso i guess Ike's took refuge at Lime.. which is a stylish club / barswanky and full of hip kids dancing it upthen i saw 2 almost buck naked buff gay guys on Marketalmost naked except for decorative sleeves over their prizes and parading next doors to Lime.I went to the Castro expecting a sandwichbut not a Subway momentfor $5 Footlongsand this was a 2 for 1, to boot!What would Jared say?i was disappointed as I discovered Ike's ain't open on Sundaysso much for my pilgrimage for sandwich Nirvana...and i got instead a nice day in Dolores Park and a funny tale of the city.I will try again and have satisfaction!3 star rating until I get my Menage a Trois sandwich, marinated with Ike's Dirty Sauce, as I'm told..! My day will come and victory will be mine!!!!!
FREE IKE'S is all i can say all the sandwiches kick ass here...And for all the haters, don't hate on ike's for making your block poppin'
Good sammies but overpriced. I love all the exotic options but the meat just isn't that good.
This place has the best sandwiches you ever have, Nacho boy is to die for. mmmmmmmmmmm
Eat a sandwich here. Any sandwich. Fresh and hearty. Don't fill up on the chips while you are waiting!!
I've been a fan of Ike's Place since it's first location across the street from the new one AND when it was temporarily @ Lime. The very first time I got an Ike's sandwich was approximately a year ago. And let me say it blew me away. I don't know about you, but IF you a first timer, I suggest the Menage-A-Trois. Why? Simply because of the perfect blend of Real Honey, Honey Mustard & BBQ sauce that seeps through the warm, tasty Halal Chicken Breast. As Reluctant as I am to write this review, I had no choice but to give it 3 stars. I'm doing this because recently when I came to the new location I ordered my favvv(Menage A Trois of course). Ike called my named and handed me my sandwich. As excited and hungry as I was, I went to the near by library to devour the lovely thing. As I took my first bite, I was not ravished. I noticed that the sandwich look smaller in height; the first time I had it was stacked up so high! I also noticed the smaller proportion of meat. Deep inside I was tearing up because I wanted to enjoy it-- to be on point I was utterly disappointed. If some how some way the Ike's Place crew can go back to their old sandwich making ways, then I would be nothing more than happy...
i live a few doors down from ike's and have seen it boom since arrival. the line stretches half way down the block most days, and the wait can be 1-2 hours for a sandwich. exorbitant? yes.the sandwiches are delicious, and made from quality ingredients. i've eaten 27394732937 sandwiches here, and they've always been good, until last night.my burger was RAW. i don't mean pink, i mean raw. i had to slap it in a skillet and cook it when i got home. out of the two orders for last night, both were way off. after waiting 1 hour and 55 minutes, i was very disappointed.burger: i paid for extra mushrooms ($1.91)--and had 4 slivers of mushrooms. that's it. they forgot the dirty sauce, and it didn't have "everything" as ordered, and was on the wrong bread.sf giants sandwich: forgot dirty sauce, didn't have "everything".i think it's time to upgrade in s.f. to a bigger shop to help accommodate customers, and allow for more staff to be hired. if it remains as is, you're going to see bigger lines, longer wait times, and more orders going out too quickly that are botched.ike, please listen to the quality feedback on yelp, and implement some changes. even loyal customers begin to stray after quality and service slip.
i like this place...well only if i can find parking, no line or a short line.the sandwiches...they have all of them...they make so many.sadly they are moving and moving far away. to palo alto. the neighbors have been disturbed by the constant traffic that the travel network has caused for this place. the line can become really CRAZY.the sandwiches are all good...they have so many and i can't seem to pick the same one over and over.they have a garlic mayo that they put with cheese and TOAST THE BREAD(you should know if you like bread toasted for a sandwich, right?) its what makes the whole sandwich.if they added the dressing that they have over at the sub center i'd get into this 25 person line before me. well, no. but its worth most of the waits i've been in...but not a 25 person wait which is what i've seen.
Holy Crap, finally some good Sandos to take the place of the horrible crap they sell at Harvest Market. That and NO ONE is eating at that Subway on Market, how does it stay in business? Unfortunately I have only been lucky enough to have one sandwich here, but it was damn good. I had "the name of the girl I'm dating." Yes, i was confused. Moving on, the sandwich was really really good, however, it was also really really messy. I had sauce EVERYWHERE. All over my hands, the waxed paper, my shirt. You get the idea. Next time I may ask them to give me the sauce on the side, as I could see dipping the sandwich being an orgasmic experience. So I docked a star for the mess and also because I really want them to have organic chips and drinks at this location. Add those and clean up my sandwich a smidge and you've got 5 motherhumping stars!! I am really really excited about this place. I am really really excited about the veggie meatball sandwich. I love sandwiches, thanks to Buddha for answering my prayers and placing a sandwich shop on my STREET.
Two stars... but only because I waited in line. The sandwiches are still awesome and the staff is still sweet.BUT OH MY GOTTT! Seriously, the people that frequent this joint need to get a serious reality check. I decided to pick up a sandwich instead of call in because I was only a block away and I got a new phone that didn't have the Ike's Place phone number preset in it yet...Well, that was a BIG mistake. I waited... and waited. I know, Ike's takes a long time, but SHIVA! that was a long time. I think the wait just to order clocked in at 45 minutes! And there were only 5 groups (three parties of 2, and two parties of 3) in front of me... but I guess that's the operative word: groups.And then a few people in line kept staring at me for no reason... I'm sorry! I don't look like a hipster, but you shouldn't stare. Shouldn't you actually be staring at one of your own kind because you think they're so attractive with their love handles hanging over their skinny jeans, their lips/ears/noses pierced so much that if you removed all the metal they'd look like Swiss Cheese, their over-processed dry and stringy-looking hair... Don't you love all of that? Stare at that, not at me.Then, the group behind me decided they would be very loud and obnoxious, yelling out loud what their menu options were over and over again, stating that they were excited about "tonight", fighting over whether the girls in the group were going to pay for the boys' sandwiches... And one of the girls kept bumping into my bag purposely and rhythmically. I figured this group behind me was probably an 17-21 group because they seemed so immature, but I turned to look at them and they all looked like they were 30 years old! AH! What's wrong with them?Oh, and the whole time I was waiting, people were drawing on the sidewalk with chalk... Which was nice. I like that people were having fun... But then one of the Ike's Place workers came out to say that Ike's Place was just notified by a police officer that it would be their responsibility to take care of cleaning up the sidewalk graffiti. He then asked everyone to stop. Everyone did stop... until he walked back inside. Then 6 people started up the sidewalk chalk drawing again... and then the staff member came back out and asked them to stop AGAIN... and then it happened 3 more times! What a bunch of lame-Os. He asked you to stop so the "mess" wouldn't be bigger for them to have to clean up. Doesn't that make sense? And after each time the staffer walked back inside, the group behind me was like, "It's just chalk! I mean, what's the big deal? You're gonna have to power wash it anyway; why do we have to stop?"Shut up! You loser hipsters have probably only lived off your Mommy and Daddy's money and only had a few lame jobs just to show them that you were "trying" so the money flow doesn't dry up... You probably don't know what it's like to have to actually work, let alone clean up a mess that you didn't even make!The big question of the day... (or question of the 4 years it took for LA hipsters to take over SF) Why do hipsters WANT to wait in line so long? Seriously... It's like waiting is the main part of the social activity. STUPID!!!I love your sandwiches, Ike, but I'll never wait in line there again...I will call, though... and when I do, I hope you can forgive me for giving you only two stars, but that last experience I had waiting to order was horrible. (Again, the staff is still sweet, so once I ordered, my day seemed to be way better.)
Listen Ike, I love your sandwiches just as much as the next person in line. Ive been to your place at a variety of hours of the day and you never seemed to let me down. I always had a good time at your place. Until now...I was in a hurry one Tuesday afternoon and I simply could not stop thinking of your sandwiches. I craved one more than I ever had. It had been a while you know. But i was in such a big hurry that I simply could not wait in line with the other folk waiting to enjoy your gooey goodness. So I decide to give you a call. i was hoping to order what had been on my mind this entire time, but the man on the phone was very rude. I knew it wasn't you. But i was more than just disappointed. He told me that if I ordered I would have my sandwich ready by 2:30. It was 1:00 when i called. Really? more than a friggin hour for a sandwich!? i couldn't belive it and asked to explain to me why i felt so betrayed. He said it was like I was waiting in line like the other customers and that I would be "cutting" the line if i were to walk in just to pick up a SANDWICH. I couldn't believe my ears. Really Ikes? Is this your new unheard of Ikes policy? You have really let me down. What do you think take out is? I liked you better when your lines weren't as long and your cashier was inside the place as opposed to outside. It saddens me to give you such a bad review, but i USED to enjoy your magical sandwiches. Now im just another customer at a soon to be overrated Sandwich spot full of empty stomachs and no hope for a quick bite. Sorry Ike's I shall see you sooner or later. Sincerely, Your former lover of Ikes Sandwiches.
There is an entire page of vegan sandwiches, all of which look so good I want to visit San Francisco again just to work my way down the list. We ordered them to go and ate them hours later in Yosemite, and my Waikiki was still great, but would have been better hot off the press. My daughter claims that the veggie meatballs are truly the most delicious as PETA had awarded them to be. And my husband enjoyed his monte chase-o he's been chasing for years now, minus the extra step of frying the sandwich to save on unnecessary calories. I enjoyed my wait in the lounge, listening to awesome music. High praise for creativity and step to stock the vegan product. I wish there were more sandwich shops like this!
Best Sandwich in my LIFE  !!!
We went to Ike's yesterday and from the reviews, I phoned the order in and went to pick it up rather than to stand in that line. We ordered Roast Beef & Swiss on sour dough and Turkey something on sour dough. Both were flavorful but to me they were lacking in meat. I'm just used to good old fashion sandwiches with more meat to be able to taste it. They said our order would be ready in 20 minutes so we walked around the area and stumbled into a Truflle factory Kitty corner from Ikes. They gave some samples which were rich & smooth but kinda small and expensive. Most of them were about the diameter of a quarter and cost $2 each. A tiny box of four cost $8 and so on. They make custom chocolates right there in the back.Back to Ikes, we paicked up the sandwiches and sat at one of the tables on the street. It was a little chilly and still dry, but the cold fresh air felt good. Service was friendly and quick, food was rather good and the price was fair.
One word, DELICIOUS! I was visiting up north and research on Yelp on the good eateries up there. Ike's Place, of course, was highly rated for their sandwiches... not being much of a sandwich fan, I decided to try it anyways. Ike's did not disappoint me at all! In fact, it was one of most delicious sandwiches I've ever had. We were there on an early Saturday, so it was not packed with people yet. There were only street parking and it was not hard to find a spot. Walking up to the store, you'll see the menu up top and people making sandwiches to the side. The girl knew we were newbies so she recommended a few popular sandwiches. I decided to share a meatball sandwich, with half jalapeno poppers and mozzarella sticks, on sourdough bread, which was called "King Koupa".  The sandwich was split in half with a lollipop for each of us. It was so good, I wanted to order another even though I was full. Highly recommended. Price is decent.Service, very friendly.Food - Delicious.
The vegan menage a trois was the the highlight of my day! The unusual combination of honey, honey mustard and bbq must have been a recipe straight from foodie heaven - a perfect combination of sweet and salty! The vegan chicken melted like butter in my mouth. The dutch crunch perfectly complemented the yummy goodness of all these fresh ingredients. The honey stickiness and dripping sauces made it a challenge but also completed the gastronomic experience. All-in-all, the vegan food angels in my head were singing!Ike was super nice and he was there handing out the yummy sandwiches. He even posed for a photo. P.S. The taste of the chicken almost convinced me to eat meat again. It was perfection (maybe it was real and they made a mistake??!)! 3 lbs of food rightfully devoured in one night!Pls open a store in the San Jose area.... pls pls pls!
man oh man. I've never wanted to eat like a vegetarian more. My sister told me about this place, and being a somewhat sandwich skeptic, i was hesitant. When I took that first, oh so good, bite into my sandwich, I knew it was love. man oh man. I can't even put it into words. I came here three times within a week of trying it for the first time.. and i live in the outer richmond. I'm sad that this place has closed, but I'd be willing to make the drive down to redwood shores for one. man oh man. so. good.
Long lines and ultra greasy. I cannot approve and nor can my queasy stomach.
I had the super mario and it was way beyond my expectations for a meatball sandwich. I will try to go here again next time I'm in town
Talk about a sandwich! They must put crack in the dirty sauce because it is SO GOOD! Warm bread stuffed with juicy goodness makes this sandwich to die for! And on top of that, service was excellent!
Everyone knows Ike is king.
You should eat before coming here. I had a burrito at la cumbre, a slice of cheese pizza at Arnell's, and a scoop of jasmine ice from bomb bay ice cream. After eating all this I had the courage to wait in line for 1.5 hours. I ordered the Nacho boy. What makes these sandwiches is the dirty sauce. The dirty sauce pretty much puts this place on the map. If Captain Submarine in Pac Heights baked dirty sauce into their bread they would also be famous. But they don't have dirty sauce so they are B listers. I would try to get into the redwood city location.  This location sucks for parking and the line is ricockulous.
You know how sometimes a really good movie comes out...and EVERYBODY starts talking like its THE BEST thing ever...then you finally go see it, expecting the second coming of Jesus...and it turns out to be...eh???Well that is NOT IKE'S PLACE. The sandwiches at this place DO LIVE up to the HYPE. I feel SO BAD that I FINALLY decided to try this place. Because my "Its always going to be there" excuse is no longer valid, I decided to try this place tonight.Being dinner time, there was only about a 3-4 person line. After I ordered, the wait was about 15 minutes. While I was waiting...the SMELLS coming out of the place were making my mouth water! It must have been the garlic and 16 spices they put in that Dirty Sauce, but I had to wipe the drool off of my mouth more than a few times.A warm feeling came over me from head to toe, when I finally unwrapped my sandwich. The first bite was PURE bliss. The dutch crunch bread was extremely crunchy and yet so soft. The "Say Hey" consists of thinly sliced, hot pastrami, cheese, jalapenos, tomatoes and wait for it...wait for it....BACON. OOOOOh. Thats GOOD! There are few things in life that blend together as well as the flavors of mayo, garlic, 16 spices, bacon, and jalapenos.The Dirty Sauce also goes well in the "Name of the girl I'm dating". The chicken was juicy and tender. The Avacado was fresh and flavorful. The honeymustard and pepperjack gave the sandwich just the right amount of tang to make the sandwich complete.YES...there is a smile on my face while I type this with my belly hanging out. I had high expectations and Ike's place met everyone of them. I can see why people wait an hour and half to eat here. Too bad I don't have that luxury. I just wish I had more time to get to know the rest of the menu better. Ike's is a real SF gem that I never took advantage of, but I guess we never know what we got until its gone.
Will my review make any difference in your decision to go to Ikes Place? Probably not but I'll write one anyways just because I feel like it. This place is REALLY small so prepare to eat on the streets or in your car. Depending on when you go the line can be painfully long. I went twice; first time was at night and no one was there. We probably waited like 15 mins which isn't that long. I got a kryptonite which I split with my friend. There's a good reason why that sandwich is called the kryptonite. It weighs as much as a small dog and probably has more meat in it than a small dog has on it's bones. Even Superman would die if he ate this entire thing. Not from from over eating but from dehydration. I only had half a sandwich and I felt like I could drink an entire ocean....literally sea water because I still had more salt in my system than ocean water. BUT it was VERY tasty and I would totally eat it again. I loved the crunchiness of the onion rings and the warm meats packed in the massive pieces of bread.The 2nd time I went was during the day and I had to wait an entire hour for a sandwich. This time I got change. This sanwich definitely wasn't as good as the kryptonite. Maybe it's because I waited too long and the bread became soggy or from the fact I could only taste BBQ sauce in it. However, I still enjoyed it and would get it again if for some reason I crave BBQ sauce.Everyone has to go to Ike's Place once in their life. If not to try the many weird sandwich combos then at least to meet a famous guy like Ike. This is a great date spot too. Who wouldn't want to have a menage a trois with 2 girls? I mean SHARING a menage a trois with 2 girls....although my first statement wouldn't be bad too.
KING KOOPA. oof.I almost had a heart attack twice upon finishing the entire thing, and then washing it down with a delicious inca cola (i couldn't believe they had it!) was just.....just a food coma.so delicious. get dutch crunch and be prepared. this is the kind of food you plan your whole day around.
The best sandwich i have ever had!!! I ordered the krypt tonight after watching adam richman eat it on man vs food. It was huge!!!!!! The guys were surprised to see a 5'4 120 pound girl ordering the gigantic sandwich. I came all the way from san diego to try it and I was glad I did. Nothing short of awesome
they put crack in their sandwiches
always a solid sando
some of the best sandwiches i've ever tasted - definitely worth the hype..and wait.try their most popular sandwich - "name of the girl im dating" on dutch crunch. but come early..they run out!happy hour runs around 5-6:30 (approx), where you get a free drink AND chips with your sandwich.
decent sandwiches that anyone with the munchies can make at home for a fraction of the price, faster, without dealing with uppity management.not sure how ikes can justify the substantial price increase, 13 bucks for a sandwich is pretty ridiculous given the medium size, but at least you get free chips!
When I went to Ike's Place for the first time, a certain natural string of thoughts went through my mind:1. "Damn, I can't wait for this shit."2. "What the hell... tell me that's NOT the line for Ike's"3. "Oh shit, that IS the line for Ike's"4. "Guh, is this even gonna be worth it? Fine, we'll just wait since we're already here."5. "Why are there so many Asians in line? Guess us Asians love our sandwiches."6. "Motherfucker, you better not be cutting in line."7. "Damn I'm so hungry... maybe I should just order 2 sandwiches and save one for later? Nah, I'm not a fat ass. Yes? No."8. "WTF?! The menu is so f-ing huge. Ok ok, people are waiting... must make decision... AH SHIT I don't know!!"9. "Wait -- where's the Kryptonite sandwich I saw on 'Man v. Food'?? Oh crap, there's more specialty sandwich choices on the flyers beneath the menu!! Why didn't I see that earlier?? Ooh, those are some big boobs."10. "Ok ok... JOAN OF ARC Sandwich on Dutch Crunch!!"11. "Damn, I could've gotten two $5 footlongs at Subway for this price -- after all this waiting, this crap better be the best f-ing sandwich ever"12. "More waiting?? Guh, I hate this shit."13. "Gimme! Gimme! It's Mine! MINE!"14. "Ooh warm."15. "Gawdamn that looks beautiful."16. "OOOOOHHHHHH FFFUUUUCCCKKKKKIIINNNN' AYYYY."17. "WOW. Deserves a Christopher Walken 'Wow' -- WAH-OW!!"18. "I see the sun."19. "The moon."20. "The mountains and the rivers."21. "I see heaven when I make sweet love to you."22. "WHY THE HELL DID I NOT GET TWO!?!?!?"
If I wasn't crashing at a friend's place in the Castro for a week, I would have never discovered this place when living in the TenderNob.Why I like this spot:1) sandwiches are BIG and cost-effective2) many delightful meats and veggie options between two pieces of toasted bread brushed with what tastes like butter3) high turnaround, which means the ingredients are fresh4) the peeps working there are niceI only had the Nacho Boy (2x) so far but whenever I come around the Castro during the day, I am heading straight to this place. P.S. It gets crowded between 12-2 so get there early if the sandwich of your choice comes with avocado and you want to make sure it makes it in there.
Everyone knows that I love Ikes. The food is great, the people are wonderful. I am currently working on trying all the different sandwiches. Whenever I come here, I get kevin to gimme a suggestion, just in case there is something that I have to try. I've been eating here like 3 times a week for a while, and i know I should cut down...but I just can't help it.This place rules.
Some of the craziest sandwiches you could ever imagine. But it works! Anything with the dirty sauce is great!
Best sandwich of my life. Not even kidding. Go here. I love the BBQ sauce and #108 Do You Smell What Barack Is Cooking? is pretty awesome!
A friend and I had to check this out, based on the menu we found online. Every sammy you could possibly imagine, with limitless options for vegetarians and vegans. We were undeterred by the 30 minute wait in line, and I had the best sandwich ever. The names of the sandwiches are clever, and once you place your order, it comes pretty quick. I had the best smoked gouda-vegetarian bacon-onion ring sandwich I ever had.
The wait is definitely not a joke ... the sandwich absolutely worth every minute. Can't wait to go back.
Believe the hype. The first time I got a sandwich here, a friend of Sandra's had come from LA to wait in line for 45 minutes. We picked them up after they waited, and they got us a Kryptonite. ZOMG, was that a freakin bomb sandwich! I've had sandwiches from Rutgers University in NJ, and dayam was this comparable if not better! Even something simple, like the Matt Cain, which just has roast beef, turkey, salami, godfather sauce, and provolone is somehow transcendent. It's not just a sandwich with three types of meat, it's an Ike's Place monument to a World Series winning pitcher (world series edition comes with onion rings!). I've never, ever had a bad sandwich here. I definitely recommend on-line ordering, then going in to pick up your order, because sitting around for 30 minutes is a waste of time. This has become a once a month splurge for lunch, because... must.. have.. Ike's...
I felt that the sandwiches here are very good but not the best sandwich I ever ate in my life kind of thing. I think that broken record has better sandwiches (on geneva) and Nugget Market in the vacaville, davis, sacramento area has the BEST sandwiches I ever ate in my life. Spent $40 on 3 sandwiches and 3 drinks. Pretty pricey for lunch and take out. Also the line is just annoyingly ridiculous. We phoned in and had to wait 2-3 hours. I don't think the wait is worth it for the sandwich. I guess the people in SF just never had a sandwich from nugget market yet so I can understand why they think Ike's is the best sandwich place.
at long last, i got to have a sandwich from ike's. on a sunday night around 6 pm, there was still a line, even tho i had convinced the hubby that no one eats sandwiches for dinner so there should be no wait. nonetheless, there was a line, but it moved efficiently, and our sandwiches were out fairly fast.i got the nacho girl, which was a salmon burger w/ avoc, mushrooms, and all the fixings. the bread was outrageously good, as was the entire sandwich itself. it was sooo huge, and i told myself i would only eat half, but i loved it so much that i ate the entire thing. i cannot WAIT to try more sandwiches from here.
Best sandwiches I had in San Francisco. Delicious sadnwiches with a wide range of variety. The foods are all about quality. All ingredients are delicious, fresh and tender
I really liked Ike's sandwiches when I first tried this place. But on my lastest visit (now that Ike has an assistant sandwich maker) the sandwiches were not as "excellent" (more messy & soggy) as on the previous visits, but still good. Maybe it would be a good idea to ask for no mayo next time.The fries (which are not listed on the menu) remain excellent every time.The apointment requirement on weekends is fine with me (I barely ever go on weekends anyways).
i love! i Love! i LOVE!!They have meat, vegetarians and vegan style sandwiches for 90 percent of their sandwich selections. i mean... where can you get that??!! the price is right, the taste is good and the people behind the counter are cool and can make you sandwich as dirty as you want. what more can you ask for from Ike? go here... soon.. FAST... it will change your taste buds but in a good way.
The hype is warranted. Look through the FULL menu list online. With all of the optionsavailable, I felt like I had to order the sandwich "Soup Nazi" style just to keep the staff and line from killing me. I only thought that because the three people ahead of me decided to take ten minutes out my life to choose... and ask questions... and ask for substitutions... As a semi-veteran of the place, always go with the dirty sauce, try the halal chicken at some point, and if you have no preference for bread, go with the dutch crunch. Menage a Trois (#111), Super Mario/King Koopa (#85/86), Cristina and Umair... (#59), and Tony Soprano (#18).  Someday I will build up the courage to try the Doomsday (#188): Roast Beef, Corned Beef, Pastrami, Salami, Turkey, Bacon, Ham, Mozzarella Sticks, Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers, AvocadoThe wait is impossibly long but well worth it. It's basically a co-operative and there are several workers running around a cramped space. If you can overlook a few... sanitation and storage issues... you'll be in for a treat! There is NO perfect time to go. Just be prepared to wait. Maybe if I go at 10:30am, on a weekday, in the rain... hmm...
so been coming here for my lunch break on saturdays. me and my co worker call and pick it up get there right on time so they are good on having it on time. grat friendly service. the only thing i didnt like is that i asked them to put there dirty sauce and on the phone they said we dont have any but will make sure will put something else and i never did anything and by the time we left i was to far to go back. but they are good half a sandwich does it for me and half when my day is done. would give 5 but messed up my order but i still go back
It is a must eat in San Francisco!
Ok..it's a mecca for sandwich lovers...HOWEVER.. the "I just printed the three or four 5 page menus that people passed back and forth while in line just didn't cut it. there were so many..and yet there were mostly just something with or without a single different ingredient... Ordered the Menage a Toi.. expected something ... well like a real threesome would be...earthshattering.. only to be disappointed..  the sandwiches were not bigger than normal (can't speak for the $20 dollar sandwiches)... however the taste and freshness were good. People who worked there were very helpful...just not what I expected... Definately not a Louigi's of Concord...  like I said.. food was ok..but I won't be making a special trip to the city for them again...
Get the menu off your iphone call it in an hour and half ahead. You can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches. Is almost like if a divine creature was in the back of this place making them. The bread is what makes the sandwich is crispy tasty and just plain incredible.
Zero Stars ....... Don't follow the hype ..... Way over priced for a less then average sandwich that you have to wait such a long time for .... Why does it take 13 minutes for a sandwich to be made when there are more employees standing around then customers waiting for their orders? To top it all off my sandwich was not toasted, limp, and bland. Old bread, bad service, and overall a bad experience.  AVOID .... Safeway is much better
I'm from Texas & flew all the way to California for these sandwiches & I would do it again in a heartbeat!! Great place to eat!! The menage a' trois...Marvelous!
I ordered the M.I.L.F. , great name for a sandwich, right! It was completely worth the 1.5 hour wait. I'm a huge roxie's fan, but this is nonetheless an amazing place to grab a sandwich. The MILF was incredibly tasty, and of course, I must try more . . . A word of advice: Call in and order it ahead of time, they'll let you know what time to pick it up.
This place is just so unsanitary . I have given this place many chances but it just keeps getting more gross. the guys making ur wich are all sweaty and STINK like B.O. and i went two days in a row once (long story) and saw the same sandwich maker wearing the same soiled in B.O. t-shirt....just picturing his sweat drip into my sandwich makes me gag. did i mention theres this old lady there that sits on the floor and picks her feet! EWE not the kinda environment i picture for a good sanwich. UNSANITARY , STINKY , ALOT OF FAT IN MEAT , INCONSISTENT PORTIONS
Hands down one of the best sandwiches I have ever tasted! We stood in line, and waited almost a half hour for our food...and believe me it was worth it!
I loveee sammiches, and I didn't mind at all that we waited 1 1/2 hours for a sandwich. I wish it wasn't always so busy or else I'd stop by everytime I'm in SF. I hope to have another one soon!!!
This is my favorite sandwich place in the world. I love it and it loves me. (there is talk of marriage)If you haven't tried Ike's, get moving. It's a pleaser.
Utterly fantastic! Waited in line for 1 hour but so worth the wait. I had the Al Bundy on Dutch Crunch-salami, ham, french dressing, avocado, smoked gouda. So yummy! It just has to be the staple "dirty sauce" that is used on all their sandwiches. I would go back there in a heartbeat and wait all over again to try another one of their delicious sandwiches.
Best sandwich I ever had. Wish there were one in Atlanta!
Does Ike's really need another review? YES. Walked by people eating a '16th and Market' and they said the line is short, call in your order. 20 minutes later I had my sandwich. Bonus: Happy Hour = free chips and free drink. I live 3 blocks from Ike's and tried it for the first time tonight. I grew up in SF and shared my sandwich with my other SF homies. It was as good as the hype. I know Ike from the the school I work at, he grew up here and he's good people.
I kinda want to puke. I was stupid and ordered the biggest gut buster on the menu - Bowser. Veg meatballs, mozz sticks, jalapeno poppers, and god knows what else?? My boyfriend ordered the veggie Pizzle (huh?) and it was doused in ranch, faux turkey and maybe bacon and cheddar. It was all good and soggy and fair-food-esque, which is totally my favorite food on the planet and all...but I still feel a wittle barfy. 30 bucks for 2 of us, meehh. Long line, but who doesn't know that? The people were friendly considering it was crawling with chubs en route to the big game. Next time I go (which I'll prolly wait a month, at least) I'll order something a little less fatso, so I can revel in the flavors, rather than just freak out they put all my favorite junk betwixt two slabs of dutch crunch.
I always get the Veggie Fat Bastard. Always!
Yesterday I was meeting a colleague to discuss business, and he suggested Ike's. I soon forgot what we were talking about -- the sandwich stole the show.I went back today and it was even better. To top things off, check this out: I called ahead for my order and they told me when to arrive (1:15 pm). When I arrived on time, there was a long line out the door. I stood on line disappointed, not wanting to be rude and jump to the front even though I called ahead. Lo and behold not 60 seconds after I got on line, one of the guys behind the counter shouted out my name, took my money and walked to the back of the line with my sandwich and change. Amazing sandwiches and service that's truly above and beyond expectations. I wish more places were like Ike's.
I. love. this. place. I went for the first time on Sunday, and I almost cried after I bit into that heavenly delight. What the hell have I been doing for my past three years in SF? Why have I been going to Subway and ordering the Veggie Delite? Why has no one told me of this majestic place of vegan goodness?Thank you boyfriend for making me go. Thank you Ike for rocking my world. Thank you Yelp for letting me unleash my new addiction on the world.
I heard about this place from fellow yelpers Mimi C. and Timothy H. Got off a plane. Took the BART. Walked a couple of blocks. Noticed a lot of rainbow flags around the neighborhood. Interesting.Found Ike's!Yay.Menu has a huge selection to choose from. What to choose? So many choices!I was debating between Eli Manning or the Menage a Trois. Decided on the menage a trois since it had a green star next to it. figured it was a popular one! Menage a trois: halal chicken breast (shredded), real honey, honey mustard, bbq, pepperjack, swiss, smoked gouda. I got it on dutch crunch bread. Delicious sandwich! Yum! $11.11 for one huge and heavy sandwich. This one's messy, so take a lot of napkins!My bf, also named Ike, got the "Say Hey", huge pile of pastrami on sourdough (as recommended by the staff). Delicious, too! Not as huge as the menage a trois but lots of meat and yummy! $11.11Go there before 11:00, right when they open. There's no line to order but it still takes a while of a wait for them to prepare your sandwich.  Then, take your sandwich, go down to Market street and take the muni or the cable car line and go down to Embarcardero and/or the Pier. Eat sandwich at the pier!The sandwiches also come with chips. Don't get the Fusion Funk "Dirty" flavored chips. They taste weird. It's not BBQ! Get the sea salt or the salt and vinegar.Price: a little pricey for a sandwich but it's huge and definitely worth it!Service: a little slow, but I'm sure they're taking the time to prepare your yummy sandwich!Definitely a must try if you're in SF!
After reading all the reviews here I was inspired to trek out to Ike's today. Folks were absolutely right - Ike's hot meatless meatball sandwich hit the spot on one of SF's coldest afternoons ever! Despite being a meat eater, I was full after eating one half of my late lunch. Make sure to have some napkins handy so that you can wipe up any oozing dirty sauce, pepperoncini slivers and dill pickles slices that accidentally slide out from underneath your hot sandwich.Did I mention just reading the fun sandwich combinations made my mouth water? My dining companion thought his hamburger was just OK. Given the many burgers he's eaten I have to conclude Ike's strength is in their sandwiches.Oh I must say that along with my "hands on" dutch crunch covered savory was the warmest sandwich making staff I've ever met! Loved how the guys behind the counter took total pride in their creations and top recommendations on what to eat - just what you want in a local shop - real people! So I'll be going back to try some of their top selling chicken sandwiches and to sample their different sodas soon!
I was thoroughly impressed after eating a sandwich from Ike's Place. I ordered a fat bastard with turkey, ham, and bacon, and omg all I have to say is that it was the most delicious sandwiches I can remember ever having. The dirty sauce is absolutely killer. I also ordered an orange chicken sandwich for my friend, unfortunately he wasn't able to eat it right away because he was in sj and Ike's Place is in sf. After about 30min I met up with my friend and gave him a semi soggy orange chicken sandwich, which he couldn't stop complementing. I assumed that since the sandwich wasn't exactly fresh he wouldn't have much to say . I couldn't have been more wrong, my friend loved the dirty sauce and now is going to check out Ike's Place for himself.
I don't think the reviews make clear what is going on with this place. This is a sandwich shop inside a night club...and the nightclub is apparently open on Saturday mornings. Seriously, they are playing loud night club music, there is a bouncer stamping hands, people are showing up in cabs and smoking outside, drinks are being served, and people are dressed up in go out clothes, yet it's 11am. (thinking I was headed to a hole in the wall sandwich shop I was dressed in sweats.). It was raining when I went so I waited inside and couldn't leave fast enough when I got my sandwich.And when I say you wait, it takes a long time to get your food, and that doesn't account for finding parking or waiting in line. I live in SOMA and my Ike journey took just under two hours. All this for what? An above average sandwich that costs $13. The woman who took our order was great too.Bottom line - Really good but not worth the trouble.
It really is that good.I lived in Boulder, CO and they have lots of great creative sandwich places, and I have always felt that this was something SF was missing. Not anymore.
Ike's Place is where you go for top notch sandwiches!The combination of ingredients is ingenious and always turn out delicious. They keep coming up with different sandwiches so visit often to try new flavors. Anything with their roast beef is a must.I just wish Ike would get a bigger place with indoor seating. The kitchen is small and they make each sandwich to order, so be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes for your order.
i never really a big fan of sandwiches but i must say this one of the better place i ate at comparing to little lucca's i rather eat here instead. i waited for 1 hour and 30 minutes, took my order and waited another 15 minutes... i didn't mind it was sunday afternoon with my friends, but i see people leave after the long wait. over all i would come back here again :P
Best sandwich in San Francisco. Period.
I love the #2 Hollywood. And my SO enjoyed his Matt Cain. **Crossesfingers they don't have to close permanently** I would like to try the other sandwiches as well.
UPDATE:I'm not changing my rating, but I'm going to say that I don't go to Ike's often anymore, and each time I go I'm a bit disappointed that I did. I love the people here, and it's a great castro area local shop, but I've been finding that every sandwich is just oversauced, and doesn't taste as good as I'd expect it. I can't put my finger on what I'd change, but after a few years of living in the area, I'm just no longer feeling the 5-star love. I'm going to assume I've changed, and I'm going to wish everyone who loves Ike's the best, and if you've never been, you absolutely should go, but it's unlikely you'll find me there anymore. Ike's we had our time together, we had a good run, but it just wasn't meant to be.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Whoa! Whoa! Stop the press my friends, bring the cows home, wrangle whatever there is to be wrangled, herd the cats and what not.I recently moved to the area (well, in a week), and walking back from a morning's work at a coffee shop I stumbled upon Ike's with a friend. We were saying we need to try more places in the area, and round the corner we see Ike's. We walk closer, curious... eager to try.Well all curiosity, ALL DOUBT, goes away once you enter Ike's. There is no doubt Ike makes amazing food, we had no question of it the moment we walked in and saw the menu, strange funny names and even stranger and so so tasty sandwiches described, and smelled the food, FELT the greatness.Where is Ike? Ike is there! Making the food, meeting the people, chatting it up. We salivated for a bit, and with some advice ordered (I got the backstabber... artichokes are gooood). It may take going back there to find the healthy sandwiches, I was looking for massive flavor fast, or I predict Ike's will have to be few times a month heaven then run to the gym indulgence.So listen Fools who wander the streets, Go To Ike's to get some eats. I guess on Saturday you better call ahead, cause the line is long, don't go to askew instead, foo!
The sandwiches at Ike's Place are just passable.I've had better at other shops..this place is really just a hole in the wall.Yes, They do have a very large menu of sandwich choices.However, when I placed my order over the phone for 5 sandwiches I didn't expect to find that the sandwiches were no where close to the ones shown on "Man vs Food" There was hardly any meats on the sandwiches. The grandness that I expected was just a falsehope.I also emailed the owner via his email on his webpage and never heard back..to report the problems with the food. I guess that the owner gotten too big for his britches since his place was on " Man vs Food" I found the food handling and safety at Ike's substandard. The guys making the sandwiches were not wearing head coverings nor were they using gloves. The main reason I complained was that I found hairs in my sandwich, not one hair but multiple hairs all the same length and color. So these came from the person who made mine.Seems like some like this place but it goes into my logbook as "Meh!" and "Pbsssssst! on food safety and handling.UPDATE:Came back after they moved to the new location and got a couple of sandwiches.. They are better than they were.. I guess in the old location it's was cramped quarters but now everyone has room to move.. My sammies were perfect.. They really have the "A" game on now and it's super consistent!! I've been back a few times so they've shown to me everyone has a rocky day now and then!!
I wish I could give Ike's 10 stars!! I love this place soo much I drive from berkeley just to get a veggie al bundy. Please open one in berkeley!!!
This place was the bomb diggity!!! We originally heard about this place thru family and then saw it on Man vs. Food. When we got there there was a line around the block...and people were saying the wait was a good 1.5 hours to get a sandwich. However we found a loophole and called out order in and came back while we ran around the city. I ended up getting the Jersey Big Meat...and boy was it worth it...damn good!!!! There was all sorts of yummy sandwiches I am itching to try next time I go up there....until then I can only dream of the sammies!
Sandwiches are superb! The waits can be long so I would definitely call in your order so you don't have to wait in the sometimes hour long lines.
Everyone has their list of guilty pleasures...and Ike's is now on mine! My bf and I were watching Man vs. Food and were excited to see that the Man visited our lovely city of San Francisco (I know old news, but we are trying to catch up on all the episodes!). One of the featured restaurants was Ike's and my bf could not shut up about coming to this place. At first I was hesitant because of the rumored LONG WAIT...but majority of the people who have reviewed this place just absolutely rave about the quality and tastiness of the sandwiches that I finally gave in :) Unfortunately for my bf, he was out of town hanging out with his grandpa in the east bay (awww...) my old roomie called me up during lunch time and invited me to go and try this place out. I couldn't resist the opportunity! We waited in line for about 30 min and waited another 30 for our sandwiches..but OMG...IT WAS SOO WORTH IT! I got some crazy sandwich called the King Koopa or something like that - it had meatballs, jalapeno poppers, mozzarella sticks, marinara sauce, "dirty" sauce, cheese...and everything else that they regularly include in a sandwich. My roomie got a pastrami sandwich and a side of mozzarella sticks. Let's just say that we were STUFFED and SATISFIED by the time we finished.  Everyone who works here is so nice and friendly - I love the fact that they can all keep their cool with all the chaos happening inside and outside the restaurant - two thumbs up to them! After I told the bf about my awesome experience - he obviously got jealous and is now counting down the days when he gets to indulge in the yumminess of Ike's.
I would just like to say that even after waiting an eternity for my sandwich outside, being molested by the san francisco nipply wind and listening to some douche tardface talk to his girlfriend for what seemed like an hour.......MY SANDWICH WAS WORTH IT!
My husband works in the city, and whenever he gets a chance to go to Ike's, I beg him to buy some sandwiches. I get a little greedy and so I had him order 3 different kinds last time. After eating a fourth of all 3, the flavors tended to taste the same b/c of the sauce. BUT I DON'T CARE. They all tasted mighty good and I could eat a sandwich from this place everyday.
Stood in line for an hour on Memorial Day Weekend, hoping it was worth the wait. Yep! Had a Nacho Boy sandwich on a Dutch Crunch. Had half then and half for dinner later--a huge sandwich. Can't figure out what makes it so darn good! There was tons of warm thinly sliced beef, avocado and swiss--but it was possibly the best sandwich I have ever had.
if you're craving a giant sandwich with lots of packed flavor - this is the place. Ike ALWAYS hooks it up for my spicy taste buds on my favorite sandwich - the MAMA sandwich that has all my favorites - including Buffalo Wing sauce and all the best peppers I could ever dream of. There's sometimes a 10 minute wait - but its sooo worth it - they make everyone's bread all fresh baked - that's why! omg...salivating now.
I had the super mario, which had meatballs, sauce and fried mozzarella. It was soooo good. I can't imagine a better meatball sandwich. They have halal chicken, too. The long line is intimidating, but it moves quickly and the food is worth the wait.
Hands down best vegetarian sandwiches around. Personal favorite: Meatless Mike (vegetarian meatball sandwich) on Dutch Crunch Bread.Pros: Incredible sandwiches, tons of vegetarian optionsCon: Long waits during lunch (I waited an hour once for a sandwich, but it's totally worth the wait)
Ike's place is my vegan sandwich dreams come true. I love to order ahead and pick up from this place.   So far my fave sandwich is the "vegan home for thanksgiving add veggie bacon, everything on it" This sandwich will never hurt your feelings. My meat eater friends often sniff this one, and taste it and love it. It has veggie turkey, vegan garlic mayo,soy cheese, whole cranberry sauce,and the regular sandwhich toppings. it is best on a roll or dutch crunch toasted.   I am also a fan of the veggie meatball with BBQ sauce and soy cheese....wow...it is a messy mound of deliciousness.  I am excited to branch out and taste the rest of the delicious offerings....slowly and over time, so i can still look cute in dresses!
Great selection of vegan sandwiches (any of their sandwiches can be made vegan). Only a few tables outside (and no space inside), so either go there before the lunch rush or take it to go. The vegan meatball sandwich is AMAZING.  I also love the vegan Eli Manning. I love that you get a vegan lollipop with every sandwich :)
Why use industrial bread when there are so many artisan bread options in San Francisco??? Ridiculous !
I always feel awkward ordering food from places with sexual or funny names. I had the Milf and bf had the fat bastard. I am not exaggerating when I say that I HATE sandwiches and have some weird OCD thing about them. I have in the past few years or so been stepping out into sandwich world and was really excited to try ikes because of their variety and their no mayo options. My sandwich was great! Really spicy! dirty sauce is obviously a necessity. Im kind of excited to go back and try a different one, though im not saying im into sandwiches now. And yeah, when the guy came out and said "Milf and Fat bastard" and I was like "yeah, thats us". Ugh, awkward!
08/07, 08/09, 08/11, 08/12:I ate here four times in 6 days.Ike's Place definitely sets the bar for the sandwich shops I've been eating at since living in San Francisco. I have a fondness for Captain Submarine over in Pacific Heights (Fillmore/California), but I honestly believe that I'm going to have to lower my grade now for Captain Submarine to 4 Stars now that I've been to Ike's. Day 1 (08/07 - Thursday): I ordered a "Name of a Girlfriend"My buddy orders the "Tony Soprano"Day 2 (08/09 - Saturday)I ordered the "Name of a Girlfriend" again.Girlfriend ordered some kind of roast beef sandwich that I've forgotten the name to.Day 3 (08/11 - Monday)I ordered the "Name of a Girlfriend" again...are you noticing a trend?Friend ordered "16th & Market"Day 4 (08/12 - Tuesday)I have now made the switch to the "16th & Market"Postiives:1. Sandwiches really are terrific. Very tasty and large. The average person will more likely than not be unable to finish it in one sitting.2. Ike and the entire staff are very friendly. When they call out the sandwiches I feel like they make an added emphasis each time to "thank" the person who ordered it. Nice touch.3. Large variety to choose from (this can also be a negative), but the sandwiches are all unique and there's a lot to choose from.Negatives:1. Very small. There's no inside seating, but only 4 tables set up outside on the sidewalk to eat from. If you don't lay claim to one of these 4 tables, then you'll either have to take it home or just eat on the sidewalk while sitting on your fanny.2. The line goes out the door (because it's so small)3. Sandwiches take a while to get because of the lines. However, I'm always personally willing to wait for excellent food.All in all, Ike's is my favorite sandwich shop in all of San Francisco now. That in itself is a big statement. Sorry Captain Submarine!
So delicious. I hope the neighbors stop complaining and let this gem live on.
I liked it. I am not sure what all the hoopla is all about though .... I have only been in when it is dead but i have seen the lines outside. I don't think that the sandwich is worth a half hour wait. I do think that it is a real good (if not a bit pedestrian ..bottled ranch dressing, regular lunch meats etc.) sandwich. I mean its not like he uses the finest ingredients available ..there's no Dave's Old World pastrami here. I will say that Ike (I presume, the owner anyway) is a super nice guy who loves his job (and his mother) and makes you feel like he really wants to make you a sandwich... that means alot in my book.
By far the best sandwiches we've ever had. And after, a sigh of sandwich climax. I had the Meatless Mike's and swapped the smoked Gouda instead of the pepperjack cheese, and it was perfect. Highly recommend.
I like Ike's! A couple years ago I discovered this gold mine of sandwich mastery. I tried the "get over it". It was LOVE at first BITE! Since then i've switched favorite sandwiches many times. Right now i'm hooked on the "Jim Rome". So freakin' good! I live in south orange county and plan entire trips to the bay area around getting IKE's at least once during the stay. I'll be up there next week and couldn't be MORE excited to get my Ike's fix!
Just moved in down the street and already been to Ike's twice in the last two days! The average sandwich runs about 7 bucks, with some cheaper and some pricier. All sandwiches are made with exceptional ingredients, served hot, and are put together like a work of art! Seriously, there's nothing worse then getting to the end of a great sandwich and only having a hunk of bread left . . . not here though, consistency throughout! All sandwiches look like they could be in marketing ads!Favorites: Exceptional sourdough rolls, Dirty Sauce!, and I haven't tried them yet, but the Guilt-Free Fries looked pretty tasty (air fried, no oil), TONS of creative sandwiches (in addition to your standards of course)Ike himself seems like a great guy that first and foremost cares about putting out a great product. He works hard (open most days 11-9pm!)and definitely does whatever he can to make sure his customers are happy. This all makes a great meal that much better!Also, for the month of December, Ike's giving away a FREE SCOOP OF ICE CREAM with most dine-in sandwiches! Get it while it lasts!
i am obsessed. i went there for the first time yesterday before running over to SF ACC for my volunteer shift. someone told me they had vegan sandwiches. i wasnt expecting much. when you're vegan, you learn to take what they have and be thankful. i could not have been more wrong. i think they had at least 15 vegan sandwiches and they offered to literally veganize almost every other sandwich on the menu. i couldnt decide so i got the vegan reuben and the vegan captn kirk, recommended by the cashier. i ate both huge sandwiches yesterday and have been plotting all morning here at work to get back there TODAY! the other thing i like so much is how friendly and vegan friendly the place is - they said chips come with but dont get this kind, they arent vegan. wow. now THAT is customer service. also they recommnded different breads depending on which one i was eating now and which one later. INCREDIBLE sandwiches!!!!
Best sandwiches anywhere, ever. Hands down. Ike's, I wish you lived in Philadelphia so we could hang out every day.
Yay, Ikes is back in business! @ Lime!! :) Phone ordering is so much better than waiting in line! Just call and get the sandwiches right at the door with your name of the order! Then, you`re good to go! Yumm! I had the SF Giants again and the Spiffy Tiffy sandwiches. Still taste so damn good!
please don't close and leave mei remember when you could sit in the store and eat your sandwichwe grew up togetherdon't leave me :'(:'(ike :'(
My wife and I went here first thing after coming into SFO. One of my friends recommended this spot as a MUST so we stopped by before heading to our hotel in Oakland. The line came out the shop because it is fairly a small shop...lots of people walking by who were clearly tourist people would ask 'wow, whats this for?'...anyways, the choices for sandwiches were amazing and we ended up getting two different ones...chicken and one beef, i forget which one it was. Overall, great service and excellent food. Worth the wait....
UPDATE: Went there for the last time; for $12 and it was awful! ............................. I have been here two separate occasions and chose a different sandwich but it was unfortunately the same; overloaded with salty sauce "sloppy joe style" shredded meat. .Did I say it had a lot of sauce Not sure what the draw is here at all.  The vegan sandwich when ordered easy on the sauce was pretty good..
To be honest it's not OH WOW, the sandwiches are good but a line in the middle of the day?
The thing about this place is all you Yelpers hype this up a little too much. This place is good considering expectations are so high but it seems inflated from all the positive reviews.  Taste: The chicken was unique because it was shredded (tuna-like). Also, I think the secret ingredient to the fries is some sort of cheesy sauce. My sandwich was pretty delicious; my friend's was just okay.Service: We were getting a sandwich to go for our friend and they told us to try stuff out before we ordered for her. They ended up making us a veggie version of the sandwich we liked even though it wasn't on the menu. The lady also reminded me of Paula Dean, in a cute kind of motherly way (a skinny non-gray haired version....actually they're not that similar at all just kidding). I loved the tootsie roll pop ending to the meal, but I asked for orange and she gave me red. Extras: What was cool was that we were totally late for our appt because we took public transportation but they gave us directions and said it was no big deal.  It is out of the way (don't take the BART, take the Muni instead).  The outside seating was nice; just wish there was more seating in general. At the end, Ike himself remembered my name and asked how everything was....total bonus (says my awesome friend Mary).  Overall: It was good considering it's a sandwich place but not sure if it would be something that I would go out of my way to go to.  Don't talk about it; be about it.
There's a good reason that this place has so many stellar reviews. Their sandwiches are better than good. They are AWESOME. Here's the sad part. The NIMBY morons who live upstairs from Ike's have been calling the waaaaaahmbulance about Ike, and they've involved lawyers. Now, it's looking like the landlord is going to evict Ike's. For what, you say? For being TOO POPULAR. They're being evicting based on a planning department technicality. I've never heard anything so moronic in my life. Here's the write-up from the Chronicle if you care to read. sfgate.com/cgi-bin/artic
One of the best deli sandwiches I have ever had. I had the Lincecum and we split a few others as well. I think they used to have a sandwich named after Zito that was really tasty also. The bread is fresh and that is extremely important in a good deli sandwich. The meat and cheese is high quality and the house sauce is awesome. It is proly even better because I only make it so San Francisco a couple times a year but it is a must on any trip to the city.
Yelp has listed Ike's as the number one restaurant in all of San Francisco for as long as I can remember. But I noticed today that Ike's got bumped down to the number two slot. That's when I got really mad at myself for never having told all of the Yelpers how much I love this place. IKE'S PLACE IS ABSOLUTELY AWESOME. Yes, I'm yelling. Yes, it's that good. There are so many different kinds of sandwiches to choose from that there's most definitely something for everyone (even people who don't eat meat or gluten, I'm sure ---err, but I haven't verified the gluten thing). Check it out for yourself. You'll love it Here's my advice, though: phone in your order ahead of tme. The only drawback to Ike's is that since so many people love the sandwiches, there's often a bit of a line.
WOW... quite possible the best sandwich I have ever eaten! Only Roxie's gives Ike's place a run for their money... and even then, Ike's still comes out victorious! I heard all the buzz about Ike's and I didn't have work for another hour and half so my girl and I went for lunch... I ended up waiting so long for my sandwich that once I got it I had to leave for work! My girl drove while grubbed down, once I took my first bite I had to check my because I thought i wet myself. For all of you newbies trying Ike's, call in your order in advance and by-pass the long line!!! If you're a sucker for pastrami like me, order the "say hey" on dutch crunch and check your pants after eating
Great sandwiches, fair price.
A Small sandwich shop that has groups of people coming in every 5 minutes and I see why. Although at first I was put off by the look of the place being kind of run down, old-fashioned and maybe unsanitary? I immediately changed my mind when I took that first bite of Jessica Alba, thats right, the #9 (name of the girl I'm dating) was just what I needed. All of their choices have cook wacky names btw.JAlba has Halal Chicken Breast, Honey Mustard, Avocado, and PepperJack but, just so you know they shred their chicken on everything, including their salads (don't bother with a salad here, they use regular lettuce instead of romaine and the chicken doesn't taste right when its shredded). Not a meat eater? They have a few popular veggie choices as well. Their fries are awesome as well. They're seasoned and baked and air dried I believe so it has a lighter taste but very delicious. 4/5 because I've had better in the bay area, but not by much. Definitely a great sandwich shop I'll go to whenever I'm around the area.
Another update: I recently found out that the eggplant is *not* vegan. Unsure if they changed their supplier or if I was misinformed the first time around. Damn shame, cuz that thing was freakin' delish.
Thanks Ike's - now I can never order a Reuben at another restaurant ever again... yours is just too darn good that no one else even compares! That's why people wait hours to order. You're THAT good!!
I know, why even write a review it has all been said. So I will just stand up on top of the highest mountain and shout "IKE I LOVE YOU!!!!" LET'S HAVE A MENAIS JE TOIS!!!!
GLUTEN FREE SANDWICHES!are they good?not so much... but its the first place in the city that ive ever seen them offered as well as regular bread... the gluten free bread is sort of mushy and gross (if youre reading this ikes place owner, may i suggest the corn bread sandwich bread by gluteno). but the fact that i have the option to get a sandwich is pretty sweet.VEGAN SANDWICHES!are they good?apparently so. im a big meat and cheese eater but one of my bestest friends is vegan and swears by ikes. luckily she lives next door so we can put our order in and come back. sometimes up to an hour, but from what i can tell its pretty worth it.also the staff are incredibly nice.try this little gem out and see for yourself!
Kudos Ike!This place has all the makings of being one of the primier spots to hit up for lunch. It is nestled in the upper market area and its locale is right off of Sanchez and 16th. The menu is extensive; layered with some great concoptions, imagination and storytelling; each sandwich has its own unique story from which Ike tells in great detail, if he's not too busy that is. Wether in the mood to just lounge or shoot the breeze, Ike's Place is where you want to be, again.....Kudos!
Their sandwiches are good, no doubt, and I'm not a sandwich fanatic, but that line?!? Ridiculous!! I've come, I've tasted, but I can't be back.
You will be missed, you were one of the stops I made while on my way to CCSF. I hope you plan to open again in the East Bay or San Francisco in the near future. And a big FU to those assholes that filed the lawsuit against such a great place with an awesome staff.
Best sandwich I've ever had! Would love to give this place five stars but the service is too slow and customers are forced to eat on the sidewalks. Otherwise, everything else is solid. Would definitely come here again.
not particularly my style.
This place makes the best best sandwiches EVER!! I just spent a month in Thailand and all I thought of was when I get back first thing I'm gettin' is an Ikes, specially the Stupid Eggplant sandwich! Sooooo good!
We went here a few months ago and this place is extremely good. We got there and about 20 people were in line ahead of us, so while waiting I pulled up the online menu which seemed to have a few extra choices. With all of the reviews being so good I ordered more than one. I am glad I did because I got to enjoy this awesomeness more than once. I am glad I dont live close by or I would go bankrupt.
I'm a big sandwich fan and all I have to say is "amazing sandwiches." Ike's is perhaps as good a sandwich as you can get in SF. You don't need to read any further; just go.
Great sandwiches that come with a bag of chips AND a lollipop? what's not to like! I had the Name of The Girl sandwich (extra pickles and banana peppers) with salt and vinegar chips. The halal chicken they use was really moist and tender and they use just the right amount of sauce and other messy ingredients to keep it from exploding all over. And they gave me a caramel apple pop (my favorite) on top of it all. I'd give it five stars but only if they had actual seating and tables
Love at first bite.
if i didnt have to wait 65mins to order my sandwich and then another 20mins for my sandwich, this would be a 4star review. but i mean really, its a sandwich and not a big one. its also not cheap... why does everyone love this place. of course foodnetwork. all the people in line were young, i dont think anyone from the castro even eats here, its all young hipsters and people who have all heard of the place from foot network. all first time people. too much hype.oh yeah, i had the barack sandwich. very messy
Best sandwiches on earth period! We drive here from Sacramento just to make a day trip to Ikes and the ocean. I wish they would come up to Sacramento!
Let's see..would I wait in line for 1+ hours to get a sandwich. Luckily, I have a friend who picked-up my order and I just had to pick up from her. She's a good friend. I know the lines get really long so she was able to call in her order and just pick up when she got there. I knew this would be a rare opportunity so I ordered 2 sandwiches. By recommendation, it was the "3-way" and "Matt Cain". I really liked the 3-way - the flavor of the BBQ and the honey mustard made this sandwich a little sweet and a little smokey. The combination of the cheese, chicken and sauce was great! One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The Matt Cain was also good but not as memorable as the "3-way". I paid about $23 for 2 sandwiches but it was worth it - it came with DIRTY chips on the side.
Can't wait to see you open up again in SF. Shukrum for the best sandwiches in town.
W-O-W!  My boyfriend and I ate here today and it was amazing. We were greeted by two very cheerful, smiling employees who helped us make our selections as it was our first time eating there. I had the vegetarian meatball sandwich and it was AWESOME. My boyfriend had the "Hot Mama Huda" (chicken sandwich), which he said was one of the best sandwiches he's ever had. We would definitely go back and recommend the place to friends! Yummmy (especially for vegetarians)!
O my! So when my boyfriend told me about this place I thought he only liked it because he is a DIE HARD SF GIANTS fan (which, I must say, has worn off on me after 5 years ha ha) and they have numerous sandwiches named after the players. But what can I say, I gave it a go. And wouldn't you know it, the Matt Cain is insanely delicious! I usually don't like to have a lot of meat in my meals but WOW this sandwich is good! For me, it is definitely a "save half for dinner" sandwich and the leftovers are definitely just as scrumptious as it was when you first bought the sandwich. I also love the fact that they give you caramel apple lollipops. Great touch! I recommend calling in your sandwich because the lines can be a bit daunting. They give you a time to pick them up and you better believe that they WILL be ready when they say they will. If you haven't tried Ike's.... you do not know what a good sandwich is yet.
Ok so this is arguably the best sandwich I've ever had. I ordered "the Joker." It had meatballs, marinara sauce, the special dirty sauce they use (garlic-like), bell peppers, onions, and a lot more. My only complaint is there weren't enough meatballs inside, next time I'll order extra aha. Service was great, they were friendly, price was reasonable (since someone paid for me). I'm so glad this place isn't getting evicted. Being out in the cold for 20min was worth it.
After reading all the reviews from this place. I was skeptical that this place was all hype and overrated. But I can assure you this is not the case. I tried one of their sandwiches and was eating it while critiquing the sandwich. I have to say, they make THE BEST sandwich I have eaten in SF. The balance of their sweet / salty / savory sandwiches makes this place awesome. Yeah you are going to have to wait a long ass time, BUT be smart and call in your order and you don't have to wait in the long line. I would recommend "Umair and Christine go to Ike's" as a first time sandwich. Enjoy! :)
One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Super fresh. They have a great variety. I had turkey, bacon, red pesto, avocado and cheddar cheese. Expect to pay about $10-14 for a sandwich and chip. This is the best place I ate in San Fran while I was there for a few days.
Picked up a Sandwich last night and had Ike personally thank me for the review I wrote last week. I checked the Yelp page and there have been 40+ reviews since then. The man is the Santa Claus of San Francisco - he just knows these things.
Just like many people that reviews this joint I've seen the episode on Man v Food. I was very worried that the place would be overhyped and that my long wait for this sandwich would be all for naught. I got the Super Mario and let me just say.....purely orgasmic. The ingredients are a bit out of the norm but then again -- this is San Francisco -- and when it comes to having a plethora of food choices in this city I'd just have to say that originality counts for a lot. On a busy day I'd have to say that the wait can go for as long as an hour so I recommend that you call your sandwich in for pick-up. Be warned that picking up your food can take at least an hour as well. Ike himself delivered my food and is a very soft-spoken guy but very friendly. My girlfriend rubbed his head and he had no objections.
These aren't your mom's lunchbag sandwiches.
I haven't been to the new spot yet but if the sandwiches are as amazing as at the last place it doesn't matter. Best sandwiches in the Bay.
Came here with my wife and dad for a quick bite to eat. I didn't read the reviews of this place, just knew it was rated high. Once we found the place thanks to our iPhone navigation, I quickly sighed and said "oh man, that place is tiny!". After driving around for a while, we were lucky to find a parking spot. It's about three blocks from Castro, so this place is pretty busy. The place inside is pretty dirty, and there is extreme chaos over the sandwiches and orders. I'm surprised our order came out with only one error. The people making the sandwiches kept yelling at each other, and many of them using cuss words which I thought was a bit unprofessional and not taking the customer into account. I looked the owner in the eye during this (guy in a top hat), and he didn't seem to care that his employees were making the customers feel a bit odd. Whatever. I ordered my sandwich and grabbed a drink, and luckily found a seat outside. Everyone else ordered their food, and luckily it was a nice day so we enjoyed the weather. My mom asked us to bring her home a BLT, so before our food came out, I went in to order a BLT. Me: Hi, I'd like to order a classic BLT Cashier: Ok, what kind of cheese? Me: Um... a BLT. It doesn't have cheese. Cashier: Yah... OK. Everything on it? Pickles, peppers? Me: Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato. Throw in some mayo, and put it between two pieces of sourdough bread. Cashier: K. When we finished our meal, the BLT came out. It was wrapped up, so I didn't open it. When my mom opened it, she said "Eww, why does it have avocado?". Ugh... I don't remember the last time a BLT had avocado. Anyway, my sandwich was actually very delicious and I would go back here again. Their dirty sauce was good, and worked well with my sandwich. I ordered the "Fat Boy" which was ham and bacon with all the fixings. I would have given this place 4 stars if it wasn't so dirty inside, there were more places to sit. and the employees weren't yelling at each other. I would have given this place 5 stars if it wasn't so expensive. $31 for three sandwiches and drinks.
Rounding up from 3.5 because I like the staff and unique set up. Virtually no seating (but they do have a bathroom) and it feels like someone is selling sandwiches out of their house. Had the Menage Trois on Dutch Crunch and while I enjoyed its flavors, I was not completely wowed. Meat was tender and seasoned just right, and the Dirty Sauce reminded me of chipotle mayo and made the sandwich, but I'm not sure if it is fully worthy of being a $12 sandwich. The Dutch Crunch bread was really enjoyable though, kind of felt like a hybrid between focaccia and the bread they use to make tortas. I had a half of a sandwich and was satisfied, but didn't find myself yearning for more past my capacity like with really good foods. Luckily we got there when there was no wait, but I can't imagine when it's busy. If you're in SoCal in the Irvine area, I suggest checking out Harry's Deli for my top sandwich place.
i'm gonna keep it short and simple:the f'n best sandwiches in the history of mankind.
Hands down best sandwich I have ever had, and I LOVE sandwiches. I got the Spffy Tiffy on Dutch Crunch. If you love pesto, this is the sandwich for you. I notice the trend of peoples annoyance with waiting in line for so long, but here's a tip... Call an hour before you want to go grab your sandwich and you go straight to the front of the line when you get there and therefore cut out the waiting time altogether
I'm not sure if the location my sandwich was from but I had the Barry B. via Luckybolt (yay Luckybolt) and it was, I have to say, just an average sandwich. The turkey was not really the texture that I like.....but I see below they have a ton of rave reviews is if I have a chance to try another sandwich from them, I might.......
Yummy sandwiches. Good sauce. It gets too messy for me, it is something I will have to take home to eat. A bit pricey for a sandwich, but you do get very big portions. I only had to wait less than 5-10 mins when I was there, but they ran out of sprouts...boo.
Ike's definitely has the best sandwiches, but the wait is the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. My bf and I decided we should order some sandwiches this past weekend before Ike's get evicted. Since this will be our 5th time having Ike's, we knew we needed to call and order to avoid the long line. We called around 1PM on Sunday and the earliest pickup time was 3:30PM. We agreed and ran some errands in the meantime. My bf and I got to Ike's around 3:45PM and of course, there was a long line. I maneuvered to the cashier, thinking that the sandwiches were ready, but instead they told me to wait outside until my name is called. I thought to myself, "How would they know my name?" So we called Ike's and asked them what their pickup procedure was. The girl was very nice and said to wait outside, while she told someone that I was already here. After 2 minutes, my name was called. My bf and I ended up getting tshirts ("I Would Live On Top of Ike's" and Warriors Logo tshirt) as well that were buy one get one free.All in all, great sandwiches! But, where is your next destination, Ike's?
Couldn't give it a true 5 since parking is the sucks (take BART) and waiting in line is a bit redunk (call in your order instead). Otherwise, nom nom nom! Created a spreadsheet of the menu and kept track of eaten, to eat, and would eat again... top of my list so far: Mills Vikings, Manage-a-Trois and King Koopa. I'm sure this will change in due time.
Smart thing to do: call in advance (up to 3 hours in some cases) to skip the line. It's all worth it.
Awesome Awesome sandwiches, gotta love the names they give them too. Only reason I can't give 5 stars is that there is no seating and the crazy lines!
I drove by after donating some books to Friends of the SFPL over on Treat. I saw a long crazy line and followed my rule of thumb - if there's a long line, it's probably good! And "good" is an understatement. Everything about the sandwich is over the top good. I had the Nacho Boy on Sourdough with everything on it. The bread had the perfect crunchy texture to it that I hardly find done correctly anywhere else. The beef was tasty and just the right thickness. Didn't have too much of any ingredient either, although I doubt you can ever have too much dirty sauce -- that stuff is mighty tasty and makes Ike's place one of those joints that you crave at random times in the day. I gotta go back and try the other sandwiches.
Menage a trois....Oooolala...being SOOOOO far from this place is so sad. WE LOVE THE SANDWICHES....make a place in SD you'd be an absolute HIT! The DIRTY sauce is awesome. Oh and the dutch crunch is the best bread i've had by far. Think about coming to SD....seriously. But if you're ever in SF you've got to try this place...absolutely worth waiting in line for.
Now this place... Let me tell you about this place. Wow I don't even know where to freaking start son. Ok, when I first took my first bite of the sandwich I shat my pants because it was so good.
Eggplant sandwich OMFG! They have so much variety that I wanted to try all of them! We waited and waited in line. Although the tour bus was the one who told us about this fascinating heaven sandwich restaurant we had to try it for ourselves. It was great and we met another couple from Orange County and and other couple that stopped and asked us if the food was worth the wait! With mouths full we signed yes with a nod! We are coming back Ikes for Fourth of July weekend!
Ike's Place is an original. Sandwiches there are outstanding. See what was written about Ike's Place in the Castro Courier Newspaper. See web link:castrocourier.com/Web_Ed
Lots of vegan sandwich options, but if you're not into the faux thing, this may not be for you. I myself am not very into the faux-meat thing, but the not-so-sloppy-Ike (vegan) is very good.I haven't had a problem with a line or a long wait, so I can say that it doesn't always take half an hour to get your sandwich :)
I know, I know, blasphemy! 4 stars...I just moved here from Boulder, and Boulder is a town stocked well with delicious sandwich joints that spread across the board. So, here's my take - Ike's is incredibly tasty - from the great breads, to the plentiful meat and veggies, to the wonderful sauces and spreads that cake your hands and plate - it's fresh, it's messy, it's delicious and leaves you feeling full like a king. The lines can be ridiculous, the "Appointment/call-in orders ONLY on Saturday and Sunday' I kind of understand, but the 5-10 minute wait/sandwich is a bit ridiculous. There is so much potential to be a kick-ass place without annoying your customers by a lengthy wait - think of how many people have walked away because of the slow service!? I do love it, but I have to plan an hour or more ahead if I really want it.
So I went back to Ikes place for a second time (because my first times wasn't that good) and now I can say Ike's place has the best sandwiches! I order Eli Maning and it is delicious!!! and now the size of the sandwich fully satisify me! Plus the free dirty chips and my favorite lollipop to end my meal off with something sweet. =) I cannot ask for anything more else. Except for stay in SF please!!
I came here on a Wednesday afternoon. The day after Ike's Birthday. Happy Birthday again Ike. Once you step through the front door, you are entering a world of sandwiches. The menu contains a wide selection of sandwiches. From your vegan sandwiches to your meaty sandwiches. Ike, the master of sandwich making suggested that I get the number 9. It was the one with your ex-girlfriend's name. I waited for around 30 minutes. So I sat down to soak in the atmosphere. Ike delivered the ex-girlfriend to me and the first bite was amazing. Each bite after was even better. Why oh why did I ever leave my ex-girlfriend? That sandwich had to be the BEST sandwich that I have ever had. Thank you Ike! I'm gonna tell everyone I know about this place because it's the place to go to for sandwiches in the city.There was a sign outside saying that you had to make an appointment for weekends. You know this place is good if there is a sign that says that.
There sandwiches are great, especially with their special dirty sauce. My favorite sandwich so far would have to be their turkey burger on dc. The only real thing to complain about is the lack of seating and the wait. Sometimes it can get ridiculous but that doesn't seem to bother most people.
I love this place. Thee only thing I had an issue with was the WAIT! I went on a Friday at about 3pm the line was moderate, about 10-15 people waiting outside standing. The guy at the register was slow. Maybe he was new? Not quite sure, but it didn't make sense why we waited for about 45+ minutes!! I learned that the best thing to do is order in advance, I believe they have their menu on their website. I ordered the 16th and Market Sandwich which included grilled chicken breast, dirty sauce (their special sauce) and avocado on Dutch Crunch bread, really yummy. The place is a Club by night, I heard from a friend that if you go on a Saturday afternoon you might get to hear some DJ spinning while eating prior to the club starting. Which is pretty cool. In your order you get to choose a bag of Healthy chips for free. Yay! Ike's has like over a 100 different sandwiches to choose from, including vegan and veggie! So you will def find something you like here especially if you like hot and ready ones. :) The only thing I had an issue with again is the wait, I never want to wait that long for a sandwich. No matter how good it is. AND I happened to be starving while I was waiting.. not fun :/.On top of waiting a while to order the sandwich took about an extra 15 minutes to get to me.Grrrr. However the inside of the place was cute. Had white chairs and couches, and a hot pink light going through the walls which definitely added spunk. In the waiting seat area around by the entrance it smelled a bit like pee though, I have no idea what that was about. But over all my input is to ORDER IN ADVANCE, don't go in when you are hungry because you will be a very unhappy camper waiting for an hour and kill the cashier. And we both don't want that now do we? :)
I had The "Say Hey" for lunch and it was very good. Hot pastrami, bacon, cheese with everything on it. I'm glad I ordered over the phone 1 hour ahead, because the line was long 3pm on a Tuesday. I would also recommend the "Sexy Boy" which includes thinly sliced ribeye with mozarella sticks. A truly unique version of a cheesesteak with a funky twist.
Great sandwiches. I've tried quite a few other sandwich places throughout the peninsula, but IMO, Ike's is far better than any of them. They just opened a new store in RWC, can't wait to go there!
So I hear about this place. I show up. I wait 30+min in line. 1 Eli Gooding and 1 Kryptonite later, I was not disappointed (but probably on the verge of dying from high cholesterol. Kryptonite = 5 different types of meat, cheese, onion rings, stuffed jalapenos, mozarella sticks, etc). How good can a sandwich be, like everyone else asks. It's pretty freaking good. Picking a sandwich was like trying to decide on a wine at a winery.. pages and pages upon toppings and options. Their dirty sauce is freaking awesome, and you have the option of dirtying up your sandwich more with onion rings and stuffed jalapenos and mozarella sticks. Probably isn't the type of place I'd go back to routinely and line up just to grab a bite (because of the crowd), but it does live up to the hype.
Who knew a a good sandwich shop still existed? This place live up to its name and the 2,000565,6863 reviews are proof. I went here earlier this year, and the sandwiches are the die for. The only draw back are the extremely longgg lines and also the hours (they close a tad bit early I think). Other than that its all gravy!
The best sandwiches around.
PZ Burger!!! Yes, the burger with the crunchy bread is the best at this sandwich shop. Always call ahead with your order because the line is a downer. I don't work far away so one of us picks up while the other drives around the block. Service is fantastic too!!!!!
This restaurant is definitely a thumbs up, they rip out the bread filling, toast the outer later of crust and fill the insides with savory meats and sauce - worth the wait.
All I have to say, is that whenever I go to Ike's, it is so f&%*$# good, I order TWO sandwiches everytime. They have over 100 sandwiches so I try to get something new everytime. Still haven't found one that I thought somewhere else had a better version of it! I'd have to say that my current favorite is the Tony Soprano!
It was a beautiful sunny day, we just left Dolores Park after the symphony and were starving. The other half got in line while I secured a sidewalk space with the dogs. The menu consisted of about a billion varieties of sandwhiches, I ordered the Super Mario (meatballs, marinara, mozzarella sticks) the BF ordered the Peg Bundy, (breaded egg plant, Avacado, French dressing, Gouda). I'm not a sandwhich fanatic but this was the best damn thing I've had in a long time! The place is tiny, there is no where to sit, the line is out the door....always. The service is friendly. The wait can be excrutiating, especially when your starving, the drink selection is minimal but hey, you come for the sandwhich! It needs to be mentioned that Ike is a hottie! Everyone must try this place, I mean really, meatballs, marinara, mozzarella sticks? It sounds disgusting but it was soooooo good!
Great sandwich. One of our favorite meals from the trip. Really no place to eat it inside. We walked over to Dolores Park.
Can't say anything that hasn't already been said. Eat here at least once if you ever live in SF.
Awesome sandwiches. The wait was totally worth it. The bread (French) was FRESH!, the ingredients were fresh/juicy. We had the "Sometimes I am a vegetarian" and some other vegetarian sandwich and absolutely loved it.I had read the reviews on Yelp, and all of them were right on the money.. The wait is long, especially on the weekends - 35 to 40 minutes, but the food is worth it. Not to mention, the staff is very friendly, and they have a cool collection of funky drinks (It was my first time drinking Lenninade, and Chai cola, both of which we loved)A must visit!
This place is to die for I'm not a sandwich fan but when I saw the line outside from. I knew this place had to be good. My buddy brought me there and man when he told me when it was at was on man vs food. I was like dada dada damn the juice off the sandwich was worth the drive off the traffic we went thru..
best damn sandwiches ever. This is the sort of sandwich I imagine that Joey from Friends would be eating, where it's so mouth watering good. It's like heaven embodied between two pieces of bread. I really like their Dutch Crunch and the french roll. It sort of reminded me of Pink's hotdogs, in the way that part of their menu has catchy names written on 8x11 sheets of paper, taped all over the walls. Except it's not as overrated as Pink's. As a bonus, you are able to order anything off their menu and make it vegan. The wait is a bit long, but believe me it's really worth it.
Very very good sandwiches.Too bad they are so pricey.
I can finally remove this as one of my bookmarks and here is my review. A coworker placed our orders over the phone and even that was a wait. Not a crazy 3 hour long wait but still, there was a wait. Anyways, I ordered the, "Do You Smell What Barack is Cooking" and although it was good, I don't see what the hype was all about and IMO, definitely not worth the crazy wait times other Yelpers were talking about. The sandwich was very fulfilling and it was tasty and although the sammy said it has smoked gouda in it, I didn't taste any of that and neither did my co-worker. Maybe it was hidden under the bbq sauce and dirty sauce, but no cheese taste in our books. Maybe it was the choice of sandwich that didn't give me that 5-star factor and I'm not even sure if I would be back any time soon. IMO, I think Mr. Pickles and Little Lucca's is comparable and might even be better in my books.
still       so        good. call ahead, skip the wait!fyi: seems like they raised the prices by a dollar and now sandwiches come with chips
Soo Yummy! I shared a Mario with the hubby and it was so good! Meatball sandwich with mozzarella sticks - how could you not love it!! They were very friendly and entertaining too! Kinda get the feeling like they were all friends and have a great time working together! They didn't have the fries and onion rings that days so I have yet to try them but I heard the go great with the sandwiches! I'll be back someday soon! =)
Came here on a friday before the lunch time rush. If i had to wait any longer than 20 min, I would knock down a star. I shared the 16th and market (chicken, avocado, bacon and jack) and my two friends share the Manage-a-Trois (chicken, honey, honey mustard, bbq, pepper jack, swiss and gouda). The 16th and market was really tasty and I actually liked the dirty sauce that their put in. The manage-a-trois was just a mixture of different ingredients that actually work well together. The sandwiches are good, but would not make go out of my way to get one. Also, they messed up our breads. 16th and market was supposed to be on sourdough, but it was on dutch crunch and manage-a-trois was supposed to be on dutch crunch but was on sour. My friends and I ordered and paid separately, so I don't know how they made this error.
There's nothing I can say that hasn't been said already: Ike's is awesome. The Name Of Girl I'm Dating on Dutch Crunch is my go-to sandwich. I've tried others before, they don't compare. Also, the discovery of ordering via phone to avoid waiting in that ridiculous lines of Ike's was a godsend. Sure you have to wait a little longer to pick up the sandwich, but at least you can do something else while waiting.
I got the Peta recommended Meatless Mike sandwich and it was delicious. It's a vegan meatball sandwich. I ordered it with pesto and jalapenos and it was amazing. Eat it straight after, since it gets too soggy if you wait. Order ahead of time, so you don't have to wait in their long lines too. You usually wait about a half an hour, but you're at your house, rather than in a ridiculous line outside. If the weather's nice, it's pretty sweet to peruse the page long veggie option page. Excellent job guys!
Excellent, mouthwatering sandwiches and great service. Make sure to get the dirty sauce!
Even for a freakin' 1 hour wait after calling in and ordering, plus a 10 minute wait after arriving, i gotta say it is a damn good sandwich, and big and filling. Got the veggie BLT. Want to try more! Go on a nice day and it's no biggie waiting outside - but definitely would call in and not stand in that godawful line. It's absurd, t his calling in sh*t for a f'n sandwich, but i guess it is interesting like absurd things should at least be, but this is just really absurd. Still good, so oh well, what can you say. Not much with the sandwich being gobbled down, cuz like i said it is darn good.
love ike's. that's an order, damn it!I've had say hey, for a gouda time call yolanda, paul rubens... beliEVE the hype. and, don't go on a weekend.this place reminds me of my beloved potbelly's circa 1992 chicago, cept different, like more vegetables.ps. ches w., I like this place but don't really like bakesale betty's. apples and oranges, dude.
Extensive menu....The bf and I were overwhelmed by all the choices we had. Normally there's a 1/2 hr - 2 hr wait, but luckily our friend stood in line for us and took our order. I decided to go with the Eli Manning - Halal Chicken Breast, Zesty Garlic and Herb Sauce, Mushrooms, Avocado, Cheddar...the worker suggested to add pesto and it was an awesome touch to the phenomenol sandwich. My bf got the Manage-a-Trois - Halal Chicken Breast, Real Honey, Honey Mustard, BBQ, PepperJack, Swiss, Smoked Gouda. This sandwich might not sound like much, but it was extremely juicy and delicious. I highly recommend both these sandwiches. Can't wait to go back and try more sandwiches =)
Came here a few times and the place is super small. They have a large selection of sandwichs and looking at the online meu will be way better......the sandwich is huge ...I got the Jeries" BIG MEAT sandwich which comes with roast beef, pastrami, turkey, ham, salami and jack...I couldn't even finish 1/2 off it. They stack on a bunch of meat not skippy like other places...Call ahead because the wait is super long....
WHAT CAN I SAY: HIMMMMMMM.I work 2 blocks down from Ike's place, and yelped my work the daay before. I see how Ike's place is # 1. Okay I say to my self, is it really all that everyone yelps about. let me check it out.I mapquest, and am floored that it's like 2 blocks away. I go there after work, and immediately could smell the food I KID YOU NOT DIAGONALLY ACROSS THE ST!I am knowing just from the smell this is going to be paradise! YEah, it's small from the hater comments, but if you are from the bay area, blding's are either small in nature (the older one's) or the newer one's are big! but it didn't matter because there's so much flavor, and I am not talking in food! the colour's of the store, nice, and fresh looking, the owner's are local natives, and over all are real! they keep it real! I like thatnow for the sanwich! I didn't know what to get because all of them looked, and smelled SOOOOOOO FREAKIN GOOD, I decided to get the "flipper". I was craving tuna! so I get it! I liked it! I take that back I loved it! baked bread, all from scratch! good.I have alot of food allergies. trust me, if it doesn't agree I will be sick within the same day!!!I DIDN'T GET SICK!!!!! The best for me!!!also, Hooda is off the hook! I love her. she's funny, and like I said, just real. If you like real people, & not stuckup, than chk out Ike's Place!Plus, I think the shaved head guy (I think it's Ike) is sexy as hell!!! WOW. KEEP THE BALD HEAD ROCKIN!!! I NEED TO GO BACK AGAIN.OTHER WISE i RATE THE SERVICE AS FOLLOWS:FOOD: 5 *****OKAY: ALL OF IT:5 *****TREE IN THE WAY: 1*(PS- THE NAMES ARE FUNNY AS HELL!"THE HASTA LA VISTA", "HOT HOODA", CHANGE WE CAN BELIEVE IN~~~~!I LOVE IT. TRIM THE TREE IN FRONT! WHEN DRIVING, YOU ONLY SEE THE COLOUR OF THE PLACE, NOT THE NAME VERY WELL/. ONLY THING i GIVE A ONE :***(
all i gotta say is "believe the hype!" the only thing that sucks is the ridiculous wait on weekends!! buttt, every sandwich I've tried is uhhh mazing. my personal fave is the say hey w/avocado and the menage-a-trois. dutch crunch is a must. me and friends were even as bold to try the kryptonite, as seen on man vs. food. that sandwich is redonk and could probably feed a family! must try in the city!
Yes please!I love Ike's sandwiches, and I think it's perfectly okay to love a sandwich. The sammies are wildly creative and delicious and over the top. Too bad they're too messy to eat in bed. The Peg Bundy is my go to, and even though the sandwich is about a third of my weight I can still polish one off, which is great because afterwards I feel both full and a sense of accomplishment. *if you plan to multitask eating one of these sammies while driving, be sure to have a copilot willing to feed you.
These are the best sandwiches ever/anywhere! No kidding! There's quite a wait (usually 20+ minutes on weekday afternoons) and that's because the word is getting around about just how incredible Ike's Place sandwiches really are. BUT the wait is sooooo worth it and I'll take the wait over any less freshness or care into my food any day. Please, please, please Ike, don't sell out, don't ever cut corners and compromise one iota of quality here because these really are the best sandwiches.All the workers are so great! Unfalteringly patient and ready to offer helpful suggestions.Also extra kudos to whoever put the magnet on the cash register which reads: "Children left unattended will be given espresso and a free puppy." Almost as good as Ike's sandwiches!
First of all, to all you F*Tards complaining about the parking...GET OVER YOURSELVES! THIS IS SAN FRANCISCO... NO ONE HAS GOOD PARKING!!!Second of all... Stop complaining about the wait. There's a wait because it's good. If the food sucked, there would obviously not be a wait. Again, get over yourselves.That said...Oh My F**king God. The first time I went there, I was like, "How in god's name can you make a BLT worth $7?!?" And I don't know how they did it, but I would have paid $10 for that damn cylindrical chunk of goodness. It was so huge, I had to give half to my friend. Then today, I had the "16th and Market" sandwich and I had to eat in my room, with the door shut and the t.v. volume turned up loud because I didn't want my room mates to hear my foodgasm... One drawback though, I'm sure these cheesy, garlic aioli smothered love subs have at least a thousand calories... at least they taste like it. The service is great. The first time I went, a cute, bald headed guy with a flavor saver goatee thingy (I'm assuming one of the owners) was really nice. If you don't want to wait, don't go at noon, obviously. I go around 11 am or around 2 pm and I have never had to wait more than 5 minutes. I wish you could rate different aspects of a business individually because I would give the food and service a 5 but I gotta give the place a 4 because the inside is janky. They seriously need a coat of paint and some shelving. And definitely some organization. It's really cluttered and it looks dirty/disheveled (even though they famously got a perfect score on their health inspection). The way a restaurant looks totally makes a place more or less appetizing.Anywoo, I highly recommend Ike's. Ride your bike over and sit outside in the sun!
Horrible horrible service!! I know this is a popular place BUT the service disgusts me. I came in with my younger brothers so we were relegated to the back which I understand since they are minors. But I asked for napkins and the waiter gave me one dirty napkin WTF? also there is hardly any soap in the ladies room and no paper towels in either restroom so I sent in my brother with a napkin. I had to serve myself the silverware as well. Very irritating experience
I remember seeing Ike's place on the San Francisco episode of "Man vs. Food". You can never go wrong with a sandwich. Yes there was a line down the block and people were all waiting for a sandwich but while waiting they handed their 4-page menu through the line with over 100 choices. 100+ choices for a sandwich place!! I ordered the Eli Manning, which consisted of grilled chicken, avocado, their delicious garlic and herb sauce and mushrooms. The sandwich was absolutely huge and unfortunately due to a 5-hour flight from SFO to Fort Lauderdale, I had to say goodbye to the second half. The staff is polite and people weren't pushy and who can go wrong with delicious grape soda in a glass bottle to wash down a quarterback inspired sandwich? I would definitely wait in line again and maybe next time finish the whole sandwich : )
all i can say is.. this place is amazing! Food: there are so many different sandwiches to try, there is just about something for everyone. We decided to get a Menage Trois on a dutch crunch roll and a Dirty Ernie on a dutch crunch. The Menage Trois was a little sweet, with just the right amount of salty. The Dirty Ernie (which can also have mozzarella sticks added to it), was just the right size meat balls and was heated to the perfect temperature. The sauce was great and the lettuce, pickles, and peppers were the perfect compliment for both sandwiches. Service: the guys/girls working there were really friendly. the line was semi-long, and a lot of people were waiting with their dogs. One girl that worked there even brought around a bowl of water for the dogs. haha They take your order a little bit before you reach the register, to help speed up the line (which still moves pretty slow). The wait was definitely worth it.Ambiance: the place is small. There wasnt any seating outside the day we were there, but it didn't matter. We walked to a park that was near by and sat there. Price: good price! definitely worth it! i imagine they could probably charge 2-3 bucks more for what you get. but, i bet the price combined with the yumminess is what keeps people coming back. if you're in SF, def try to stop by here and have a bite to eat! plan on waiting in line though.
I got the Nacho Boy and it was one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. Plus, they gave me extra Dirty Sauce on the side. Definitely worth the wait in line, even if it was raining...
I'm on board. I came in on the early side a few months ago after reading all the reviews here. And thought, WTF, it's just a freaking sandwich, right? Well ... it was so early it was just me and Ike, and I got one of the warmest welcomes of any place I've been in San Francisco. I ordered the Backstabber. A great sandwich. When it came out, it kindled memories of days gone by at the Super Sub Shop on 8th Street in Miami where I grew up. Sandwiches memorable 30 years later.I came back again with a friend a few weeks ago. The hospitality was equally warm, and the sandwiches equally good. The place has soul.
I must say the Menage a Trois was one of the best sandwiches ive ever had. Of course i expected the long line, but it was worth the wait. Place does take Credit card, so no worries about finding an ATM. I can't wait to go back here again.
I went to Ike's finally after my friend kept pumping it up for months. I ordered the Mnage  trois. This sandwich was good, but man, it was waayyy too juicy. I'm only giving Ike's 3 stars even though almost everyone gives it 4 or 5 because in my opinion this sandwich was not worth $10, was waayyy too juicy, and did not meet they hype. I will try a normal sandwich, because this one seemed like a heart attack on a sourdough roll.
dutch crunch~! so... good ( = stopped by here for lunch during a recent trip to norcal, ike's definitely did not disappoint. a girl who stood behind us kept raving to her friend how good the dutch crunch is and it's "the" bread to get. having never had a dutch crunch before, i decided it was going to be my choice of bread. i chose something simple, elvis keith w/ dutch crunch, while my other half got the tony soprano w/ sourdough. the shredded chicken breast was tender and moist, the bread was soft... overall, it was a great sandwich without the different flavors over powering each other. unfortunately, i was too full to taste the tony soprano, but i'll trust the boy's "mmm... good. so good..."i'm kinda sad that i didn't give this place a try sooner when i used to be in norcal more often... = / but i'm sure i'll stop by again on my next visit ( =
Don't leave Ike. I could do with one of your sandwiches every day I don't want to have to drive down to Stanford to get one. There is usually a line here but if you look at the menu and write a few of the items down you should totally just call in and order so you can pick it up ready to go. Huge delicious sandwiches. I hope you stick around. If you have a group, please stand to the side and don't act like you are in line, its confusing.
My first time in San Francisco and Ike's Place was the meal I remembered the most. Tried the paul reubens and Manage-a-Trois and man were these great. I'm typically a "boring" sandwich eater but man the combination of ingredients and flavors you'll find in the sandwiches are yummy. I wish I could've tried more.
Great little hole in the wall. Ike is a nice guy who obviously is living the dream (and working hard at it). The sandwiches are good and reasonably priced. You can get the 'wich the way you want. Ike takes your order and then heads back to whip it up fresh just for you. I'm not so keen on the "no-guilt" french fries. They've got a tasty external coat of spices but since they're "air fried" they lack the crispness and firmness of their deep-fried brethren. I can't blame Ike for this, I appreciate that he's trying to incorporate healthy options.Ike also offers up a number of coffee drinks, shakes and ice cream (he buys Pollyann ice cream -- a great shop in the Sunset on Noriega).There are only 2 small tables at this place inside, so seating is rather limited.
My review is solely for the food, not Lime where Ike's is camped out.The 188. DOOMSDAY changed my life! It is a solid contender for my last meal on earth. I dream about this sandwich, when made with love it is amazing!~J
If I have to wait almost an hour on a Saturday afternoon for a sandwich, it'd better be the one I actually ordered...unfortunately, that wasn't the case for me. After confirming my order at least twice with the guy at the register, I still managed to receive the wrong sandwich. I was really disappointed. The sandwich was good, but not great, and definitely not worth an hour of your time.
Really really good burger. Had the Eli Manning.
I just discovered this awesome sandwich place, and it's closing down? That sucks. I went here twice in the last week I liked it so much. I hope they find a new home fast b/c I will be going to Ike's in its new location. Best sandwiches I have had in a long time.
Talk about the Deli to go to!!!I haven't loved a Deli so much since High School- during those lunch hours where you get in your car with all your friends- and go to "the" destination for good food and some socialization! Plus, I haven't craved a Deli sandwhich since then either, until I went to Ike's for the first time!!!Ike's not only has an amazing staff, super oober friendly group- but they know their sandwhiches back and forth! The best thing you can do it just ask them what they are in the mood for today- and say "Yes please! That's what I'll have!!!"Don't stick with the old boring meat, cheese and veggies... spice it up with their fun picks of the month!! Don't get me wrong- their meat/cheese sandys are awesome too! Heaping portions of avocado too! People always skimp on this... but not here!I've only been twice so far, and have LOVED each sandy, both being very different. Can't wait to go back next week!Thanks Ike & staff!!
I live 3 blocks away and have never been so today I was working from home and decided to try it. I told my fiance "how different can sandwiches be?"Well, very different. Man these are great sandwiches.I can't remember the name but it had roast beef, avocado, cheddar and the works. The cheese was melted and the bread was warm. Yummy goodness. I'm excited to go back and try different sandwiches.
This a goofy funky place with great food. I had the mission burger which was very tasty. While the location on 16th St has an offbeat charm, the popularity of this sandwich shop almost requires that they have more space. We were there on what was probably a slow day and we had to fight over the few tables they have out on the sidewalk (maybe three). That's the only reason for less than five stars.
The most amazing sandwhiches
unique combo flavors = bomb ass sandwiches!
Great sandwiches, great service, great atmosphere, though I am somewhat saddened by all the tourists who watched "Man vs. Food" who are now converging on Ike's, creating an even longer line, but heck, they do deserve better than Subway and Quiznos while visiting the Wharf.
Believe the hype.A perfectly constructed sandwich with creative options and a lollipop for dessert. Some of the sandwiches won't keep due to the sauciness, but I like a saucy sandwich. You just have to commit to eating a lot in one sitting. 5 Star Deli.
I am a sandwich snob and was dismayed when I could not find a decent one in the Castro. That was until I met Ike and my waistline will never be the same. Most people the first time they enter the place just seem to stand there overwhelmed by such audacious creativity from a sandwich shop. Be risky in what you choose because the staff won't be afraid to tell you to order something different (i ordered a 16th and Market the first time I went and Ike advised me to change the order). Just one example of how the whole experience is so personal.When you do get your sandwich be sure to loosen your belt (especially if you got it on DUTCH CRUNCH BREAD!!!) because the sandwiches are huge. If, by chance, you finish the mammoth meal you can wait through the food coma by sucking on a complimentary lollipop. Why aren't you at Ike's Place right now?
Godly sandwiches, handsdown. I was there the other day for the first time with my friend. I ordered "The Pizzle" (chicken breast, bacon, and some other stuff) with pesto on Dutch crunch. It was an orgasm in my mouth, literally. It was a very warm and sunny day, so it was pretty packed. Expect a 15-20 minute wait. I wouldve given them a perfect 5 if it didn't take so long to get my sandwich, but In a sense, it was well worth it.
My family LOVES Ike's! I went there because I found out they make gluten free sandwiches (my daughter has Celiac Disease). I got one of those for her and got regular bread for the rest of our sandwiches. We are now hooked. She loved her gluten free sandwich (first deli sandwich she had in over a year) and ours were the best! We love the SF Giants, Pizzle and Spiffy Tiffy.
I love this place I try to go when ever I'm in town. There are sandwiches there that you can't get anywhere else and I love their dirty sauce it's so good! I haven't been since they moved so I can't say anything about the location. I have a dream of trying all of their sandwiches it might be a futile attempt but a girl can dream :) I put four stars only because I have to drive from San Jose so it's a bit of a drive.
I feel that I should have a larger sample to work with before giving out 4 stars, but the one sandwich tried here was stuffed with six jalapeno poppers.
Orgasim in a sandwich!!
Awesome bro
I called in the other day to order two sandwiches and was quoted a 2 1/2 hour wait time. What's the point of calling ahead if I still have to wait 2 1/2 hours on top of the 1/2 hour I'll probably have to wait to pay?! Not cool, Ike's. I know you guys are popular, and I know there's only so many sandwiches that can be made at a time, but there's got to be a better way of handling the amount of business you guys get. Having to wait that long for a sandwich pretty much guarantees that (1) I won't enjoy it as much, & (2) I won't be likely to come back often, since I don't have the time to wait that long.
I've been wanting to try this place for months, and I finally did today. I built my own sandwich and ordered an "unoriginal" with chicken on wheat bread and grilled mushrooms and avocado add-ons. My sandwich was delicious! The chicken was a little dry at times, but I loved the soft bread, the especially tasty grilled mushrooms, the heaping amount of avocado, and the dirty sauce that held it all together. My bf didn't seem to enjoy his sandwich, the SF Giants, quite as much though. Also, the staff is extremely friendly, which I'm beginning to find is more uncommon than not in San Francisco.
OK, time to re-do my Ike's review. Upgrading from three stars -- I guess I'm a regular now. Yum.In short, Ike's is great for vegans and vegetarians. They have a secret (long!) list of vegan sandwiches which they'll show you upon request. I've been working my way through it. The Backstabber (fake turkey + artichoke hearts) with avocado and mushrooms was my favorite so far. Also, my average wait time for sandwiches has decreased, even at high noon. And Ike and his staff continue to be awesome folks.
We have been going to Ike's for about a year now and unfortunately it is getting too busy for its own good. The sandwich selection and dirty sauce are both amazing. Between the meat loaded sandwiches and the included sucker for desert you have a cardiologist and dentist 's dream. The problem is the wait, with a call ahead on a nice day running you 2 hours and the line being an equally long gamble, Ike's is starting to loose it's luster. Sandwiches are now sloppy to the point of being hard to eat. Hopefully the (rumored) new location will help even out the crowd and bring wait times back down. We love Ike's but it's gotten out of control.
Huge menu! The prices range from $8-$13 per sandwich. I got the vegan Brutus which was absolutely delicious! But it set me back $12 for just a sandwich (and a lollipop too!). I think I was supposed to get a bag of kettle chips too, but I think they forgot. No biggie. If the price were a bit cheaper, or the line a bit shorter (the line is long! waited 30 minutes to get through the line and get my sandwich at 2:30pm on Sunday!), then it'd be a 5 star, no question, because the food is so damn tasty and they have such good vegan options. I'm definitely coming back sometime, and hopefully it'll have a shorter line next time.
Ike's is great. San Francisco needed a good spot to get vegan subs, and Ike's Place surpassed my expectations. It did take about 10-15 to get my food, but I knew that going in and it was well worth it. I got the vegan no so sloppy ike and it made my day.5 stars because Ike was there, helped me pick my sandwich, and came by to see how it was after. Great guy, great subs.
Best sandwiches I've every had hands down! No need to go into details.. I'm keeping it simple, try this joint out you will not be disappointed!
I've had an Ike's sandwich before, but I had it picked up for me and, though it was delicious, I felt like I might appreciate it more if I had the wait in line for hours experience.I don't know why I would put myself through such an unpleasant experience, but I did. And what better time to go than on the hottest day of the summer, right before it was scheduled to close forever.We waited for an hour and was pleasantly surprised when we were told that it was "Happy Hour All Day, to thank all the supporters" which meant, FREE SODAS FOR EVERYONE! Now I don't drink soda, but I like free stuff so I didn't complain. I ordered the "Sometimes I'm a Vegetarian" and was sad to find out I had another 45 minutes to wait.. Now I would probably have taken a star off for this surprise wait if it weren't for the super friendly staff and the delicious sandwich to come. I planned to save my sandwich but my cousin said that I absolutely had to try it fresh at least once. After the first bite, I knew that I couldn't save any of this messy, oily, drippy sandwich. But it's okay, it gave me something to do while I waited for my delayed bus.
Quality did not live up to the hype, not to mention the long wait. When it takes thirty minutes after ordering to receive a couple burgers and a cheese steak sandwich, and when the sandwiches are just ok at best, you realize how over-hyped some places are. Such is life in the city.
More of a marketing hype rather than good quality sandwiches. We've tried three sandwiches so far, and didn't like any. They have a pretty long menu with hip names for each item, however the quality of bread and meat are subpar. Their dutch-crunch is barely crunchy, the roast beef and pastrami are outright tasteless. At the end you feel like you had a heavy, bland meal. There are a lot better sandwiches out there if that's what you care about. But if you are more into OMG-this-menu-is-so-hip-that-all-cool-Gen Ys-must-eat-here, then you'll love this place :).Still 2 starts instead of 1, because I've seen worse.
This place is so amazing and vegetarian friendly. I ordered Dutch Crunch, Dirty Sauce, veggie chicken, veggie bacon, jalapeno poppers, pepper jack cheese, avocado, grilled mushrooms, lettuce, onions, tomatoes. It was absolutely killer. I highly recommend it. My only issue is that I wish they would put their crazy online menu at the sandwich shop. Also, it would be cool if they had a better pricing options for build your own sandwich.
Order #1 and #15. The French Fries are delicious with the mustard sauce.Good sandwiches
I just so happen to be driving in the neighboorhood with a growling tummy and this enormous line down the block caught my eye. The wait is worth it. I ordered the Tony Soprano: salami, ham and turkey lettuce tomatoes italian dressing and provelone. I preferred cheddar my BF had the Change: thinly sliced ribeye steak, beer battered onion rings, bbq, smoked gouda it comes with Dirty Potato Chips and a drink All I can say is that this place rocks its giving Little Lucca and Roxie's a run for their money. Next time I go i'm having the MILF!!!!
Delicious as always - made the schlep from Fremont to SF just for a couple of sandwiches from Ike's this past Saturday. We also remembered to buy our "Free Ike" t-shirts while we were there. We just love this place. Thanks to Ike and Alex for being awesome!
Nom nom nom.
I went there for the first time after hearing about how good their sandwiches are....drove all the way from San Jose& I must say it was worth the 45min drive& the 20-30min wait for my sandwich....LOVE IT& DEF will return for more!!!!
I just have to say it, yes - for the circa 1700's time... I waited for my Montana to Rice sandwich for almost an hour and every second of the wait was worth it.
Bomb! The pizzle is bomb! I called in the order while i was at blue bottle getting my sunday coffee...mmmm. I called around 10:45 and my sando would be ready at 11:55. yeah seems kinda weird, but they are super busy and really appreciate you calling in your order. You also can skip to the front of the register line!....Super nice people for how crazy busy they are....and the food.....well all the reviews make it pretty apparent that this is a bomb place!
Ike's Place is the god of all sandwiches! Who would have guessed that a regular sandwich can be transformed into a delectabale gourmet item? Aftering seeing Ike's Place featured on Man Vs. Food, I knew I had to have it. But where do I start? There are too many sandwiches to choose from, a wide variety of meats, veggies, toppings, condiments, sauce, etc. Each sandwich is attached to a whimsical name and makes the whole experience all the more fun. I had to try the Name of the Girl I'm Dating because of the rave reviews from Yelp. But when I saw the Bad Santa... I knew I had to get my mouth around that bad ass sandwhich. A chicken fried steak topped with cheese, marinara sauce and other goodies I can't quite name. What to do? Which one do I choose? The answer: Both! End result: A happy mouth and a satisfied belly. I can't wait to try everything on the menu. My plan is to go with my bf once a week and order something different every time so that we can explore every crevice of this sandwhich monstrosity that is Ike's Place.
Okay, I was only there once. But, with the time they take to make a sandwich, they can't seem to get the order correct. About six customers in front of me (a short line) plus about five walk-ups collecting take out orders. One worker ran after a gal to correct her order and one pick-up was explained he got soy cheese instead of swiss cheese. My cheesesteak was feh. Although I had stated only, the steak, provolone and grilled mushrooms, onions & peppers- when I got to eat it. It had the dirty mayo, lettuce, tomato and pickle. The amount of cheese wasn't appreciable. The order was repeated to me when I paid and repeated to me when it was handed to me. Just a bunch of slackers beyond the scenes who obviously can't handle the situation.
Simply one of the best sandwich places in SF. You also get free lollipops! Free sandwich on your birthday too.
Believe the hype. . . eat at Ike's!I went here yesterday after my roommate had made me feel like I don't even know what a sandwich is if I haven't eaten at Ike's (and I KNOW all about sandwiches)!I won't go into the sandwiches themselves because there are plenty of others reviews here to get yer mouth watering. What I will say is that my favorite part upon walking through the door was my reception.When it became apparent to the guy at the register that I was fantastically overwhelmed like a kid in a candy store, he actually walked me through it. He talked me through Ike's favorites and the monthly specials until he landed on one that set off happy-happy-joy-joy feelings in my stomach. He was into what he was doing and it was clear these guys knew they had something special. You'll know it too when you visit Ike's.
I took 7x7 advice and ordered the Menage a Trois. I took yelpers advice and called my order in. Both of these suggestions made for a great experience so I can't wait to go back and try something different. We took our sandwich down the street and ate in front of the Eureka Valley library.The sandwich was amazing (with *free* chips), overall the whole experience was fun. Who ever took my order when I called in was friendly and gave helpful suggestions. Picking the food up was easy and the staff was respectful and funny. Since I called the order in I never saw a menu but next time I call for a sandwich I'll just tell them what I'm in the mood for and take the servers suggestion. Since they use quality ingredients, everything is probably excellent.I don't give it five stars because its not the best sandwich I ever tasted, excellent, but not the best. I'm glad I went though. Oh, and they are asking for donations for legal fees. Not sure how I feel about that. It seems like with people waiting in line for two hours they might be making enough to cover those fees. Especially at $12 a sandwich. I hope they stay open, I want to try another sandwich
What they said.
hype makes me uneasy. i just can't help it. like, when everyone started watching the office? i started losing interest. i know it's a great show, but i can't help it. i mean it's so annoying hanging out with a zillion michael scott impersonators every single day, no matter where i go. i haven't watched that shit since season 3. i didn't even see jim and pam get married! so you can imagine why i wouldn't be jumping over obstacles to try a place like ike's, with all the attention it's been getting--ESPECIALLY cause i rep roxie sandwiches til i die boyyy(mission terrace/ingleside all day baby whaaaaaaaaaat). but i decided to check it out.the first time i hit up ike's, it was a magical day: the sun was out, everyone was in summer gear, chillin on the curb and waiting for a sandwich. perfect day to eat outdoors. at first, i was really confused at how ike's actually had a physical building for their business, but customers made all their transactions outside unless going in to grab a drink. but whatever, i got in line and glanced over their epicly long menu. i won't lie, it probably took me around 5 days to pick what i wanted. i'm already hella indecisive as it is when it comes to ordering anything. yo ike, how you gonna have like 200 items on your menu at a sandwich shop? killin me over here. they have great veg/vegan options too, so i've heard. i have part time vegetarian tendencies so i cant wait to check those out. dude working the cashier was really cool, as they all were. except one dude wore a name tag that said "ike" and i really thought he was "the" ike but he turned out to be a fraud named joseph or some shit so i kicked his ass. anyway i got the nacho boy--roast beef, mushrooms, avocado, swiss. holy shit, it was amazing. and the lollipop was a pretty sick dessert too.like i said before, i rep roxie to the fullest...but i won't lie, my first experience at ike's has been pretty memorable. i'm going to be coming back here over and over again. i'm thinking of it this way: classic sandwiches = roxie, weird but delicious sandwiches = ike's.
During a trip to San Francisco, we were looking for places to eat. We yelped up this sandwich joint that is located away from most of the city's traffic. From the closest BART station, we walked to Ike's Place (which was still quite a walk). There was a long line and we figured that there would be at a restaurant with 2000+ reviews and a solid 4 1/2 star rating.The girlfriend ordered the MANAGE-A-TROIS, which came with chicken, honey mustard, some other veggies and DIRTY SAUCE. I ordered the CHANGE, which came with ribeye steak, onion rings, bbq sauce, and of course DIRTY SAUCE. The sandwiches were probably one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The DIRTY SAUCE is a must in the sandwiches. I prefer the MANAGE-A-TROIS over the CHANGE and if I remember correctly, the MANAGE-A-TROIS won some kind of award for best sandwich.The dirty sauce is some kind of house garlic aoli sauce, but it is delicious. I'm sure every review has and will mention the dirty sauce (including this review).Ike's Place is pretty far from the city and the long lines here will keep you waiting. Still if you're in the area, have some time to spare, and want to stuff your face with amazing sandwiches, be sure to stop by and try it at least once.
simply divine. best sandwich evvvver. even the bag chips tasted awesome (included in the price!)being my first time i didn't know what to order since every sandwich sounded delicious. i went with a cashier recommendation, menage a trois on dutch crunch, and it didn't disappoint. hala chicken, real honey, honey mustard, bbq, pepper jack, swiss, cheddar was epic. i'd recommend eating there while the sammy is still hot and not soggy.
I had one shot only with this place with the limited time I was going to be in the Bay Area. So I ordered the one that everyone seems to love on Yelp, the Name of the Girl I'm Dating on a Dutch Crunch. I ordered it by phone and it came out hot right on time which was great because you get to avoid the line. About the sandwich. It was FREAKING GOOD. The dirty sauce got all over my hands and pants, unfortunately, but wow I'd eat this thing naked if I had to. As a visitor, I hate that I have to come home to a place with no Ike's.
My review won't add much to the other 1800 reviews on here but I want to add one regardless because I looooove this place. I was initially introduced to this place by the segment on Man vs. Food. I'm not much of a sandwich type of gal, but wow, this is probably the best sandwich ever. I've tried 3 different ones, but Manage a trois is definitely my favorite and the one I keep on getting over and over again.
By far the best sandwiches I've ever had. They take so long to make them, probably because their always so full and busy, so call with time on your hands like 2 hours in advanced. The "756" and "papa sam" are my current sandwich favorites. bon appetite!
Rip-off joint. I clearly looked at the price of the sandwich after choosing it from the menu and was charged almost 2 bucks more than what i should've...and not it wasnt due to tax. The young cat at the front who works the register must be a 2 bit crook or not kno wtf he's doing. sandwiches are overrated. go to new brunswick, nj for the real deal son!!
The best sandwiches place ever. You need to order to go and the line might be a little long but it is totally worth it . The food is delicious and Mike is the best order taker ever. It was my first time to this place and I can't wait to go back!
With a glint in his eye, Ike invited my order and made me feel right at home.NOT a sandwich Nazi, Ike's the kind of small business owner who's whatever you need him to be. Though I hear his place is normally teaming with customers, I strolled in late one afternoon to find myself first in line. There was no rush to order, no eyes rolled as I stood in the doorway deciding what would become my memorable first sandwich at Ike's. I finally chose the [insert girl's name here] chicken sandwich and OH BABY no regrets.I feel like I consumed a nicely packaged bundle of avocado-stuffed love and I look forward to many more lunches with Ike and half the Castro. I just hope Ike and his crew know what they've done; By setting the reference point they can only go downhill unless they give maintain such high standards.I'm betting they will.
sorry but Ike's is so overrated, yea they make a good sandwich but the hype has gotten out of control, its like the tulip mania of sandwich shops, google that shit. First of all waiting for 1.5-2+ hours for a sandwich is insane,I don't care how good it is, expand your staff and get a bigger location that can handle the demand, after all you are selling sandwiches like hot cakes for now what has become about $14 bucks a pop after raising your prices. Not only that even at the old location when I would order a sandwich the clientele waiting were repeatedly yelled at by staff to "GET ON THE INSIDE OF THE SIDEWALK AND FORM A LINE" several times followed by a worker with a jar asking for donation money as some kind of pity for the fact that their neighbors were suing them, yea I feel bad that the lame yuppie neighbors took it to that measure but why the hell should I give you money I'm already paying you like 15 bucks a sandwich, how about you get a new location so the customers don't have to snake around the block... So onto the next Ike's experience, guess they sublet-ed the waiting area at Lime, weird. It felt like buying drugs from a kid out of his parents basement. So we stood in line for like 15 mins come to find out it was the line to pay for your order not place it, and somehow this made sense to place this line at the entrance? Even attempting to assess the organization I felt like a donkey doing calculus. So moving on to the correct line another 20 mins passes before I place my order, then pay in the other. After that we waited for over an HOUR for our sandwich, glad I grabbed a few bags of chips and cherrywine for a five finger discount in the process. We then ate our sandwhches which were ok, but I always feel like a slug 30 mins after eating it. In conclusion Ike's is a stupid mess, way overpriced and not worth your time, Mr Pickles is JUST as good and half the price I have compared and contrasted many times. Ike's would never get away with this shit on the east coast in a city like NY but clearly SF loves to follow hip and trendy fads so will put up with bullshit in the process.
Whatever...if you like swampy sandwiches, this place is for you. I personally prefer to have dry hands when I choose to use them. Even when I'm soakin in Palmolive. And the wait...Hell No! I don't get it? A line around the block and for what? A wet sandwich! Like I said, whatever.
I worked at a deli I LOVED for over 4 years thoughout my high school years so you could say I am a bit of a sandwich snob. Went to Ikes...I would like to eat here everyday please. I think a system... like calling your order in ahead or eating out at the park would be the answer to many of the complaints below. Small businesses in the city that are desired = long waits or dealing with other customers. Duh!
Definitely the best sandwich place I've gone to in SF...possibly ever. It is always delicious, and the variety is outstanding.I think Ike understands one of the key ingredients to a sandwich: the bread. Their bread is extremely fresh and totally delicious, and it makes for a very satisfying sandwich. I strongly recommend this place.
love this place
I'm giving them 4 stars even though the second time I went the service was really slow and the new location is smaller and super crowded! I like the vibe of this place the sandwich creations are funny and just a good place to try at least once. It is pricey so be prepared to pay 10-12 dollars for one sandwich and a bag of chips. Just try it out it's an experience in it's self. oh and there is really no room to eat inside so get your laps ready or do like me and eat in your car. Thats a real downer! :(
Hands down the best sandwich I have ever had. Had to wait about 30 minutes in the pouring rain and It was well worth it. Got the jim rome and it was excellent. Can't wait to come back and try all of them!
Here, if you need any more recommendation - I love love love love love Ike's Place! I once stood in line for an entire hour and then waited another half hour for my sandwich to be made, THAT is how good Ike's is. On a hot Sunday afternoon grab a sandwich from Ike's then walk to Dolores and eat as you yak. That is what we do. And yeah, I always go for "Change" yum yum!!
I've only been there once, and probably won't go again unless my friends make me - but if they do, they're paying. I paid $9 for a sandwich and waited 30 minutes for it (after I waited 20 minutes in line). Overrated, overpriced, way too hyped. I suggest you try it at least once. I think "Meh" describes it accurately.
I love this place. And, I am picky about my sandwiches. The perfect sandwich must have perfectly layered ingredients and a sauce that moistens the bread, which is ideally toasted. All sandwiches at Ike's are prepared hot, which gets them star number one. Star number 2 is the dirty sauce alone. Since I cannot stand mayo, often I am disappointed with a dry sandwich. Oh contrare, my friends. The garlic aioli here is light and perfect, not being overpowering or tasting anything like mayo. Star 3 lies in the options... with over 150 sandwiches ranging from basic to ecletic, there truly is something for everyone. Star 4 is the halal chicken. All I can say is wow. And, star 5 is the staff/service. They are so helpful and want your experience there to be outstanding. They aren't impatient with people like me who peruse the menu for 20 minutes asking questions. They WANT to help you nail the perfect sandwich and are truly passionate about sandwiches. I would give a 6th star for the free lollipop that is a carmel apple pop or some blow pop variatoion. Icing on the cake, if you will!!!I had the Eli Manning and was blown away. The only thing I would have changed was adding pesto sauce also (free of charge)...My boyfriend had the menage-a-twois (sp?) with dirty sauce, bbq sauce, honey mustard and honey.. WOW. They don't put so much of everything that the sandwich isn't manageable either- it is perfection in your hands, then mouth. Trust me, go here. And, vegan/vegetarian options galore. It's insane. No seating really, and it takes 30 minutes to actually bake the bread fresh to order. I would wait 5 hours for that sandwich.
call ahead. then jump on your bike and get your ass over there. your sandwich will be ready for you when you arrive.life can't really get better than this. its not one single thing that makes ike's awesome. because it can all be replicated singly . . . but together, man that is one awesome sandwich.
The legends are true. Ike's is a mystical sandwich oasis with delicious concoctions to soothe the savage beast that is your greedy lil' belly. Oh yeah and the line is off the chart. Go early, go late...just don't go right at lunchtime or you'll be sad.
I can't really add anything groundbreaking that hasn't already been said about Ike's. I have visited numerous sandwich shops but this place is far and away the best. People complain about the wait, lack of seating, and price but nothing can take away from the greatness of their sandwiches. My personal favorite is the Barry Z. (I'm not sure if they even list it on the menu anymore but they still made it for me). Wasn't cheap but anything named after Barry Zito has to be a little overpriced.
Of course, the sandwich was top notch! But what was even better was placing a group order in the morning, Ike's saying 12pm, and then as I was waiting outside I could hear them dispatching the countdown "2 minutes till order up....1 minute till order up" Then 12:00 on the nose!Awesome sandwich and handling the time crunch with ease. Amazing.
I'll keep this short and sweet. SF Giants on dutch crunch with EVERYTHING except banana peppers. HEAVEN!
order: anything dirty, menage a troisveg: meatless mikei have nothing to add to the thousands of people that love this place.just call ahead (when you're not hungry) and drive up and pick up your sandwich and eat in the car and arrive at home and repeat.
LOVE Ikes! Everything I've tried has been outstanding. My favorite...the turkey burger...delicious!
Ike's Place is solid all around.While yes, we can complain repeatedly about wait times, and location of lines, we're missing the point here, and that is that Ike's Place IS San Francisco eatin'. The atmosphere, attitude, and awesomeness are mashed together perfectly to provide a eatery unlike any other.I'm a personal fan of the Matt Cain (GO GIANTS) or the Change, with onion rings, or some other extra toppings to bring a unique flavor, but really, all the sandwiches are worth a try.If you're a tourist, local, or something in between, you should really be ashamed of yourself if you haven't given Ike's a shot yet.
No need for me to add anymore detail than the other reviews - I simply need to say that Ike's sandwhiches are THE SHIT.Been there twice for the burger - great. Live in Pac Heights but the trip is worth it.
Holy crap, is this food? More like manna from heaven. These gut-busting, mouth watering sandwiches are to die for. Who cares if there is a long wait? Its totally worth it. And you can work on your tan as you wait in line in the sunny Mission. Don't think, just do it, you wont regret it.
Well worth the 1 hour wait in line! So far The Joker is hands down my fave, followed by King Koopa, and the Menage a Trois all three on Dutch Crunch. Ike is one awesome guy!
Nobody but Ike is putting this much heart and soul into a sandwich these days. Totally worth the wait, and even worth the mad confusion at Lime! Love the pages and pages of sandwich options and tons of stuff for vegetarians and vegans (so cool).Advice: download the menu from the website, call and place a pick up order, then go and get it. This will reduce any unnecessary waiting and frustration.Ike is such a friendly guy. So glad things are working out at Lime. I was worried there for a minute.
i just one one item. delicious, made my heart slow down."#86: King Koopa - All Beef Meatballs, Mozzarella Sticks, Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers, Marinara Sauce"
listen, this is a san francisco diamond in the rough!  the best best best sandwich i had was the Paul Rubens. such a departure from the classic rueben... such a combination of ingredients with IKES special additions. I love how the staff are so friendly... and funky! with a great knowledge of the product, describing every sandwich down to each delicious morsel.I loved the menage a trois sandwich - BBQ sauce so salty sweet and flavorful! I love that this place is a local hole-in-the-wall, local business that as just blown up, just for the fact that their product is good. I love how they will prepare and specially wrap the half of your sandwich TO-GO. Great food, great service -  i would say that these sandwiches are worth the drive out to the mission .
They have more than enough reviews, but boy do I love this place! Nacho Boy Supreme!!!
New location a disappointment at the highest level! Not a place to enjoy a big, messy sandwich. Food still rocks, but the SF club scene in the afternoon on a Saturday adds a scummy layer, unpleasant taste. Please, Ike's go home where you belong. We'll meet you there.
So glad Ike and company are back! Hands down best sam-iches in the bay ( any better pls let me know!). Tired of Subway? Pissed off at Jared? Ain't trying to lose a few pounds? Then this is your spot! The names of the sam-iches alone is enough to warrant the long ass wait LOL and yes you will wait and that dirty sauce... man you can put that on cardboard it will be good. I hear that they are located inside Lime now... I haven't ate there yet but if they are cool enough to host Ike's I might give them a shot. If you are in the city or anywhere neat their other locations here in the Bay, you have have to hit them up.
Best. Sandwich. Ever.
Let me start by saying the only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is b/c they don't have any place to sit at either location, and it is unadvisable to travel far with a sando from Ike's. My first Ike's experience was at the Redwood Shores location. It's unfortunate that they're not open on the weekends b/c I would likely gain 15 lbs from over-indulging. The staff at that location is super kick ass and always down to make a recommendation based on your tastes. Everything I've had so far has been delicious and messy. Messiness is a major indicator of sandwich greatness in my book. I recommend the Matt Cain, but honestly you can't go wrong with anything from Ike's. BTW Ike is a super cool dude and gave me a card for a free sanger when I mentioned that I frequented the new (at that time) location in the shores of Redwood.
There was definitely a long wait today but it was totally worth it! I tried to call in my order but was told that the wait would be 1.5 hrs(!) and 1/2 hr if I waited in line b/c they were on Man v. Food and now ppl were ordering the Doomsday sandwich left and right. By 1:00, they were out of steak, burgers and chicken breast! I ordered a #2 substituted w/roast beef and a #9 substituted w/turkey and both still tasted yummy! Will def be back to try the other sammies :)
I am NOT a sandwich liker. No no no. I take the bread off. Can't stand condiments. Would rather eat the filling piece by piece, with a knife and fork, like a civilized person. AND I am a veggie. I see the line at Ike's every day on my way to work and roll my eyes. Those utensil-less plebians. butIf you can't beat 'em, JOIN 'EM!Ike's is AMAZING!I had a veggie SF Giant's sandwich there today and I can NOT stop thinking about it! (read "CRAVING IT!!") Warm, salty, crunchy - grilled mushroom-chickenless patty-baconless topping - aoili - red jalapenos - swiss - pesto-ey gooodness.While I was waiting in line, they ran out of avocado. That was the number 1 ingredient I was craving on my 'wich, man! But, lo and behold, the sandwich was abso friggin lutely delicious anyway. No substitution needed.And trust the guy who's ringing you up if he recommends an adjustment. I did, my man did, and we were all the happier for it.Alas, I am now a sandwich gal & will be back.
Yummy sandwiches! They're big and delicious! I ordered something with Salami and the boyfriend ordered something with Pastrami. The one he had was yummm! The place is small so the line will be outside. Can't eat it inside, only out or take out. Takes awhile to make but it's worth it!
Ah-mazing.
Excellent sandwiches and worth the drive, search for parking, and wait, if you have to do any of this. Theres so many choices that its very hard to decide what you want. I dont really like the mayonnaise taste in my sandwiches so im glad they have their "dirty" sauce for their sandwiches. They have a very extensive selection of sandwiches many different "dirty" chips, and sodas. I would like to have a little more bread in the dutch crunch but i cant complain too much. Plus for having lolipops with your sandwich too. Theres only 2 tables there so plan on eating somewhere else.
After hearing a lot of rave reviews about Ike's, I decided to try it out. And considering it's two blocks from our house, it's amazing we hadn't tried it earlier. My hubby, not a fan of waiting in lines, was dubious. Could a sandwich really be worth a potential hour long wait? We (and by we I mean me) had to check it out, so we bundled up our two boston terriers and headed on down. On approach, we saw the line and hubby shoots me a 'oh for f***s sake' look which I happily ignored... it looked long but it was moving and I was determined... so we joined the queue. About 30 mins later, we were at the front door (where the cash register/order station is set up) and ordered. I had the Super Luigi (Meatballs, jalapeno poppers, marinara sauce, oh boy) and hubby had the CA BLT. Once ordered, we stood to the side and waited. 25 mins later, along came Ike, with our order. Super nice guy, clearly genuinely loves what he does and it made the experience even more worth the wait. We trotted on home and delved in. Mmmmmmmm it was SOOOO good. Freshly baked (to order) bread, no skimping on the meatballs and poppers. And HUGE. I had to put half aside for 15 mins to let the first half settle and decide if I could fit the 2nd half in (which I could, well, half of the 2nd half at least!), and even 15 mins later when I hit up the 2nd half, it was still nice and warm! The only downside.... not enough marinara sauce... I'm a big sauce fan and that was my only disappointment. I couldn't even tell if there WAS marinara on it or if it was the Dirty Sauce or mayo, or a combo of the three... I don't like dripping sandwiches but it was a little too dry for my liking. Next time I might have to ask politely for a little extra sauce (on the side, just in case they then get sauce-happy!) Other than that, it was Deeeeeelicious. Will definitely go back, the wait is worth it and you get to meet the owner of a true neighbourhood gem of a place. And while you wait you get to people watch and see some really 'interesting' outfits! I don't like giving Ike's 4-stars because I think it is probably worth the whole 5, but the sauce (or lack thereof) killed the experience a little... and next time I go I'm hoping to modify this to a full-5.*** RevisedSoooo, the next sandwich I got from Ike's was The Catch (meatballs, marinara, cheese) because I just couldn't justify getting the one with jalepeno poppers on top! It was DELICIOUS again and this time, just the right amount of sauce! Still not sure what the "dirty sauce" is, I really need to ask for a side of it next time but regardless, the sandwich was still amazing. I LOVE these meatballs!! And I'm not a crazy meat-eating person but these meatballs are to die for! I don't even want to try any other Ike's sandwich, I just want this one over and over again! So Ike's, you got my five stars :) Just a shame they're no longer on 16th, but still around the corner from us as Lime so it's really not that bad (for us).
OMG...it da best sandwitch I've ever had. I ate there for the first time a few months ago...it was a recommendation from my step son and his girlfriend. Words cannot describe the sandwitches. Another kool thing are the names...check out their website for the menu. I love sandwithches and this place is the best. Don't disappoint yourself...go hungry because they are not cheap with the meat.
I am going to miss this place so much when I leave SF. I've never tried any other sandwich besides Name of Girl I'm Dating. The chicken breast is awesome cause it's shaved making it easier to eat. Wait can be long sometimes but it's worth it!
love the place, but yeah, they are so inefficient! figured i could save some time by calling it in -- was told that it would be 45minutes before it would be ready. Are you serious!? i could have a 5 course Chinese meal /delivered/ in less time. last time i was there, one of the employees spent more time putting on plastic gloves and taking them off than actually doing anything productive.  and the person at the register (dunno if she's the boss) seemed too nice to be able to direct her employees. they need to get someone in there to help them redo the layout and figure out how to optimize things. like rather than having some woman spend hours chopping all the toppings, perhaps use a food processor? it slices! 40 more minutes to wait before my sandwich is ready. *sigh*
This place is awesome!!! Can't go wrong, but prepare for up to an hour wait.... I recommend going for the dirty sauce, and everything.
Legit. Probably one of the best sandwiches Ive ever had. Definitey get the ditch crunch, best bread by far. Go on a nice day, grab a sandwich and eat it at Dolores Park, amazing! Only downside is the line, but definitely worth the wait!!!
Great sandwiches. Grab one and head to Dolores and enjoy the view. Afterwards, if you still have room, head over to bi-rite and grab a popsicle.
This place is everything it's hyped up to be, and worth waiting in the line that is always, always there. I had a vegan sandwich, that i can't remember the name of. I'm not vegan, so judging from a meat eater's point of view, the sandwich was delicious. it was so flavorful and just so awesome. It was definitely on the large side, so come hungry. there's not always room to sit, but everyone is so nice you can probably share a table with another group or just bring it somewhere else to eat. the park isn't too far.
I would give it 4.5 stars if i could but i can't so it gets 5 then... but my favorite sandwich place and everytime i'm back home in San Francisco i always end up here with my buddy Wes. -(Wes is single btw for any girls out there wondering)anyway the sandwiches just can't go wrong for some reason. i had the "Just Friends" and the "Hollywood" something sandwiches and they were both awesome. the just friends has some halal chicken in it and hollywood has some steak meat in it along with some cheeses. both are around 10 bucks and while i personally think it's a little overpriced, i'd still go there again... if you like the bread they have a few options i like wheat and dutch. not many places have dutch bread as good as ikes so thats a +1 in itself... sandwiches do come out rather oily depending on the amount and type of meat you chose. but they have a pretty good deal of buying one of thier superhero sandwiches like lex luther, superman, kryptonite, and something else that i can't remember... anyway those go for a little more than $15 bucks but is essentially the same size as 2 sandwiches.the chips are good too. they use Dirty Chips and its basically like kettle chips but they have this one flavor that just combines all other flavors and its pretty damn good too... anyway you can call in orders too but they're pretty smart about it and they'll tell you that your order wont be ready for an hour or two depending on the line and they wont let you call in at like 9 or 10am and ask to pick up your sandwich at 12 or 1 pm... instead they'll say ok it can be readying in 10 minutes come by, in other words you gotta wait there's no way to beat the system...
One of the best sandwich places ever!!!!! Expect a long but fun wait. Everybody there is just anticipating to eat their yummy selection. The menu is quite extensive but I guarantee you every choice will be appetizing. Will go back there again! Every bite was mouth savoring.
i wanted to try little luccas but it closed at 5, so my cousin said, "oh my friend mentioned another sandwich place in the city that's really good. let's try it". decided to type in ikes into the gps and voila! we found this little treasure. it's in the castro and parking was kinda hard, kinda not. we just got lucky i think and found a spot close by. this place is small. literally.. a hole in the wall. haha. but the food is quality. sandwiches have funny names like "girl im dating at the time" or something. the girl who rang us up was reaalllyyy attractive. and i'm not into girls like that. but she was hot, seriously!!!!! no wait at all, but we came in on a wednesday at like 6pm. maybe that is their non-peak hour? it was happy hour too so with our sandwiches we got a free bag of chips and drink. i looove free stuff. we sat outside and ate. it was soo windy so it made eating a little less enjoyable. my cousin ordered the BLT and there was no bacon in it. wtfff. she was like... i knew it felt like i was eating a lettuce wrap! ahaha. so one less star for that. but they graciously took the sandwich back, made her a new one, and gave her a card for a free sandwich on top of that. so good job on redeeming yourselves! we got free caramel apple lollipops. i accidentally threw mine away though. ugh! so sad. we also saw a picture of the man vs. food guy!!! he went to ikes last month and filmed there. he ate some big sandwich i guess. anyway.. i think the episode will play later this month. cool huh!!
Thus far, the best sandwiches I've had in the bay. Unlike many other delis, Ike's place actually flavors their subs to perfection. In addition the staff are extremely friendly and fast considering the number of fans that come here for lunch. Ike's Place...I'll see you soon!
You remember that first time you were in a candy store without your parents or the first time you got laid? Roll the feelings into a sandwich and you got an Ike's classic.I just ate a spicy M.I.L.F. and she was dam good!Best place for a sandwich in the city, hands down!
Cristina and Umir... Bacon, turkey and ham with avocado, peppers, provolone and, I think, pepperoni... on a dutch crunch roll. The crunch of the warm roll and the crisp warm bacon, soft fresh avocado, piled high with meat. I think I'm in love.Just be prepared to wait for your sandwich gratification.
Good bye Subway, Quiznos and any other sandwich places Ike's place has the best sandwiches I've ever eaten in my life. Although there is a long wait it is better to call in first because waiting in line would be at least a hour just to get your food. I had the 3way aka the Megage a Trois it was delicious and very filling
This place has some truly amazing sandwhiches! The long wait that you will experience to eat here is worth it. Or more to eat outside of here since the actual store front is tinnny. There is also limited seating outside of the restaurant. There are lots of vegan options to choose from and usually other options that aren't on the menu. The first time I was there I had a sandwhich called "Sometimes I'm Vegan" and the second time I had "The Vegan Backstabber." I would highly recommend either sandwhich. My friend got the fake meatball sub and loved it. Expect a lot of meat and cheese replacements, and fat in your sandwhich, and expect to love it. It's maybe a bit pricey for a sandwhich place. You'll probably spend $10-11 with tip. But it's worth it. Ike knows how to make sandwhiches! My friends and I suspect that he was trained in the art of sandwhich making on the east coast.
I just had to write again. I'm obsessed. I think for a week or so their oven wasn't working properly and I couldn't get my stupid eggplant sandwich, so I tried the vegan meatball which was also good. But I have to tell you, I must've looked like a kid who's had someone steal an ice cream cone out of their hand, "no stupid eggplant??? what? no! this cannot be!". I get it with jalepenos added. I think I will order one right now!!!! :D
Ike's Place has really really good sandwiches. Almost every time I go, i try a different kind. If the cool sandwich nicknames won't win you over, the taste will. Topped with their signature dirty sauce, the sandwiches are pretty unforgettable.I have had the Milf, the fat bastard, the barack, the meatless meatball, and have tried several others.The sandwiches are pretty big and filling. Even I have a hard time finishing the sandwich.Word of caution. THE LINE IS REALLY LONG DURING LUNCH. Look at the menu and call ahead so u can just pick it up. There is no place to eat it so why not.Price Ranges from 10-15 per sandwich. It is definitely worth the wait.
Off course they have a gazilion reviews, their sandwiches are off the hook. Definitely no lo-cal sandwich but they taste um-umm-good! Not sure if it was my "Hot lady huda" or Jamie that my hot lady exceptional, but I was certainly satisfied when I was done. I really cant think of another sandwich thats tasted so good, so I think these guys deserve 5 stars. I usually am not a fan of never ending menus, but I get the feeling that all their sandwiches are gonna be pretty yummy so In this case I guess it worth making an exception.
We came here on a whim because we randomly found ourselves in the city on a Thursday night. My boyfriend had the big meat, which came with all the meat u can imagine, it looked huge and weighed a ton! He enjoyed it. I had the mnage a trois because it was going to be featured on man vs food and I wanted to see what the fuss was all about! Lol. It was really good and flavorful! Really messy! But I enjoyed it, I even had half a sandwich for later, and it still tasted good as leftovers! The line wasn't too bad when we got there, so we got out sandwiches quick and the nice girl working the counter helped us pick out some winning sandwiches. Sandwiches can be pretty pricey, compared to what I'm used to paying, about 9$ a sandwich, but they definitely represent their price in meat and flavor =)
The sandwiches were alright.
best hot sandwich ever.rules:- call your order in- if they say it'll be done 90 min from when you call, order and wait it out- dont wait in line when picking up your sandwich, bypass jealous hungry people and go straight to the register
Best sandwich place I've been to so far. I usually try not to go when it's packed but I tell you, it's worth the wait even if I did. My favorite is the Joker: it's a pesto meatball sandwich. Best meatball sandwich hands down! I can't wait to try the Superman (their biggest sandwich yet) when I'm really really hungry.
I thought the sandwich was very good. I liked the bread and the fresh ingredients. I think it is the dirty sauce and the breadth of the menu that sets this place apart from the rest. Call your order in unless you want to wait for 45-60 minutes for a sandwich...
Ever since I saw that Man vs. Food San Francisco episode I have been wanting to go to Ike's... All I can say the one hour wait was totally worth it... I ordered the Going Home for Thanksgiving on Dutch Crunch ..The bread was soft and chewy.. The warm cranberry sauce along with the turkey, cheese, dirty sauce and all the fixings was a party in my mouth. Nothing compares to a sandwich from Ike's. Service is totally friendly and accommodating. . I totally got to try the Redwood City location during the work week..
called ahead.friend in-the-know places order. like a pro.i am expected to consume half.half an order loaded with items i wouldn't, under normal circumstances (of which, these are clearly not), allow to pass between my two lips. what now?!?*scrunches nose*(thinks "dang, why didn't i chime in here?")half an hour and a few, sun-drenched blocks later, with the line out the door and half way across the GG, i find myself parked in a cheap plastic chair on the sidewalk. i lean back and tilt it up against the building. *swoons*a white paper bag materializes in front of me, fumbling around, crinkling the paper inside. warm, gooey, crisp, oozing out from between its dutch crunch wonder, one has got to wonder if i spent too much time in the sun that day or if it truly is bliss...
Since my last review of Ike's in March, I have found out about their Redwood City location which is even closer to San Jose. It is kind of weird at first because it is in the middle of a big business building. It took me a minute to find the place but once I walked into the lobby all I could smell was Ike's goodness throughout the halls. Seriously people, this is the best sandwich place in California, period. They have something for everyone even vegan options. The dirty sauce is like nothing I've ever tasted before, it is delicious! My favorite sandwich is still the cougar, which is the #6 with shredded buffalo chicken, ranch, mozzarella sticks pickles and lettuce. I cannot describe in words how good these sandwiches are, it is something that you will have to experience yourself. What are you waiting for???
oh my dear, dear, ike,making sandwiches that everybody likes.your sauce is so dirty,and the names are so flirty.i wonder if you have a diploma,in making food that puts you in a coma.in truth, i've never had a sandwich so good,you are truly, the best in this hood.
This place is awesome! They got so many great sandwiches! So delicious ! It's always a good idea to share one, they run pretty big.
Why not give Ike's yet another review. If there is a sandwich place that ever deserved to be the topped reviewed place on Yelp it most definitely Ike's. Sometimes when I'm buying what is considered a 'gourmet sandwich' from some other spots in SF I just feel dumb forking over 7+ dollars for a 'wich i could have easily made myself. This is not the case at Ike's Place. They have so many unique sandwiches, choosing one can be quite difficult. That's why i have my own method. I just started off with the first sandwich on the list, and have worked my way down the menu sandwich by sandwich ever since. This method came to be after i spent a good hour trying to decide what i wanted. I soon came to realize that you CANT GO WRONG with any of them. There is not much seating at Ike's as the place itself is tiny. This only provides a opportunity to take a nice 4 block stroll to Dolores Park where the devouring begins. Ive been going to Ike's for 4 years now, and Ike's is still always a surprise to me thanks to their variety. If you haven't been to Ike's yet...seriously what are you waiting for.Note: sometimes it's a good idea to call in your order in advance (especially on the weekends) because it can be quite disappointing to show up and have to wait an hour to get a sandwich. But by no means would that wait not be worth it.
We did not know what we were getting ourselves into when we showed up at Ike's for lunch at 12:30. There was a line of hip people down the street with an hour wait for take-away sandwiches. We were too hungry this day to stay and check it out, but we made it our mission to make it one day to try the sandwiches that we heard raved about it. For our follow up trip we called in our order and went to pick up. To my surprise, Ike, the namesake, was standing at the door organizing this sandwich factory. I had the Menage a Toi, which people had raved to me about. The sandwich was quite good, but I think it was partially the planning and game of it all that made it that much sweeter.
It's an awfully long wait for a very saucy sandwich, maybe they could lay off the dressing so you could enjoy the toppings.. just a suggestion.
AMAZING, by far the best sandwich place in the world!
I came here after I saw Man Vs Food. I am not a true sandwich fan but hey you gotta be good to be on Man Vs Food. I came on a week day about 2pm. Took about 30 Min's to order and get my food. I did like the sandwich but it wasn't good enough for me to wait 30 Min's for. Don't get me wrong if my buddies were to happen to wait in line and pick one up for me I would have one all the time. If they could speed up the process I would give Ikes four stars!!!!!
We ordered the superman! OMG it was HUGE!!!!!!!! I would give it 5 stars but the wait was horribly long but totally worth it! Will be back on Friday =)
Ike's makes a great sandwich and the staff is a friendly bunch - from my experience. I don't recall the name of the sandwich I had (they all have nicknames) - but it was a basic turkey sandwich with avocado and veges. I like my sandwich simple, without an overwhelming amount of flavor overload. They made mine well, because it had the perfect amount of fresh ingredients. Not as 'amazing' as some might claim, but it's a Castro/Mission favorite - which I can appreciate. Grab a sandwich with a friend and walk over to the beach (Dolores Park).
Happy Anniversary! I've been wanting to try to this place ever since I saw it on the top 5 list. Yesterday, I happened to have the time and the weather was nice to walk over there from the Castro underground. The wait was about 40 minutes for a sandwich, but I can say it was well worth it. I was entertained while in line. There was a lady talking on her cell phone about bringing her little dog for a visit to her friend who has a cat. I was afraid of stepping on her little dog. While waiting, her dog regurgitated a piece of hot dog. I was wondering why the dog kept on stretching himself. The people ahead of me had friends eating their sandwiches. The girl got mad because one of the guys threw something out. Apparently, it was a pop candy that was included with the sandwich. The owner gave her another one at the end. The menu reminds me of a high school essay report, 10 pages. So many choices, sandwiches with their own unique names "Hollywood" and "The guy I'm dating", burger sandwiches, vegan, and instructions to how to order the sandwich. I needed to study up just so I can order the sandwich. Dirty sauce (aoila garlic, yummy), with pesto or no? I finally got to the cashier, who was literally outside the door way taking orders. Good thing it was a beautiful day, what happens if it rained. You can call in your order ahead of time. Many people did and they didn't have to wait. They strolled up or in one case this couple was out for a jog and came up, paid and got their sandwiches. The cashier lady was nice. She asked my opinion about the Subway sandwiches. "Subway sandwiches sucks!" (I repeated). I got a discount on the sandwich. That was the surprising part. One lady said she liked Subway, but changed her mind easily. I had the #2, Hollywood, rib-eye steak, with mushroom and provolone cheese, dirty sauce, dutch crunch, with everything, except no mayo. It was delicious. It reminded me of the Carl's Jr. commercial of the dripping hamburger. Mine was the dripping sandwich! The rib-eye was tender. It wasn't like you were fighting with it and chewing it to death. I see the hype and the hype is good.
The staff at Ike's place know how to put together an amazing dare I say perfect sandwich.
Small and unassuming, Ikes place has just what you need to fill that hunger void. Always worth the wait, even just to see what Ike is wearing. They should open at least two more stores around the city and cater to the 10-4 after club scene crowd.
slippery sloppy juicy gloppy salty chewy cheesy meaty crispy crunchy toasted hunks of good.not the kind of sandwiches I could eat every day. or every week, even... but tasty and satisfying absolutely.we had:  Menage a Trois ($8.98):Halal Chicken Breast, Real Honey, Honey Mustard, BBQ, PepperJack on French- tasty but as you would imagine, super sticky  Paul Reubens ($7.97): Sliced Corned Beef, Home Made Poppy Seed Coleslaw, French Dressing, Swisson DutchCrunch- everything was great but the corned beef is way too thick and difficult to sever with teethMustard, Pesto, and Jalapenos free upon request. - that's pretty cool.we took the online menu's advice and called the order in. 35 minutes. perfect.we got there in 25. parked across the street.stood in line.they asked if anyone was there to pick up, and we were.easy as pie.friendly, efficient service.ridiculously huge sandwich menu with endless options.the lollipops in the bag were a nice touch.the only thing I've got to say is that they should also include wet wipes as these were about the messiest sandwiches I've ever encountered.so, grab extra napkins and bring your appetite....
So far my favorite sandwiches have got to be the Change, Menage a Trois, and the Meatless Mike (it pains me to admit that a vegan meatball sandwich is one of my favorites). Definitely go with a friend so that you can do halfsies and get even more variety.@ all of the folks visiting from LA. I don't even want to hear you mention Bay Cities Deli unless it's preceded by "Man, this is so much better than ____". There's truly no comparison. From the sandwich variety to the ridiculously tasty sauces, Ike's blows Bay Cities away. When it comes to sandwiches, SF is king. You don't hear us claiming we have better Mexican food do you?
the sammiches here are most definitely worth the hype, but at $10 a sammy, it's not something i'd do often, too many other deals at $10. love the no hipster zone, unlike the their old location.
I never heard of Ike's until my coworkers told me they wanted 2eat sandwiches 4lunch. So they order it over the phone that was a great idea cus when i got there 2pickup the orders there was a big fn line. The sandwich r kinda small I say 3rd behind Roxie's & Little Luca but by far taste way better then Lil Luca. If u r looking 4 a great sandwich 2eat in the city def try Ike's.
What can I say I like Ikes! I live in the area and ever since we lost Mays aka M&L I've been jones'n for a really good sando and then along comes Ike! The tremendous amount of choices are unbelievable. But one of the things I like best is that the you can combine anything on the menu you want. Sometimes I go right off the board and other times I get creative and mix and match so to speak. Ike himself is right there crankin out the awesome food so it's totally owner operated which I love. We see so many times places start out great then the owners hire people to do their job who don't have the passion and understanding of the business. Anyway check out Ikes He puts out a quality product, well portioned, at a fair price.
While my fiance and I haven't gone back, we were pleasantly surprised by Ike's personal reply to us regarding our first visit. It shows they really do care about their customers. Would definitely give it another try when we're in the area.
very hungry on a saturday afternoon my boss and i wanted to try ike's sandwich that everybody raved about. since we are in the castro distract, we called in for a pick up at 2:30 thinking that we bypassed the lunch time. wrong! we could not pick up our sandwich until 3:20pm! we waited. i walked over at 3:15, omg! there were literally 50 people outside waiting to place an order! Got back with 2 ike's sandwich and can't wait to dig in. yes it's very yummy! does not feel to heavy. i'm a small girl and usually i can only eat half of the sandwich and save the other half for later. but i ate the whole sandwich! after eating it i felt satisfy, but not too stuff where i can't move. but i don't know if it's worth the wait. i guess i will call in earlier next time around before i'm hungry
Very delicious sandwich shop. I ordered the hot mama houda. Yummy!
Well, I figured I should try this place out, since I am a big sandwich fan and have sampled sandwiches all across the country and have a lot of opinions about them. Plus, it's near my house, so how could I not go there at least once? Assessment: Mostly, I felt like there's a lot of hype around Ike's and that it really isn't worth the wait or the money. I phoned it in as recommended here, and was told it would be ready in two (count em 2) hours. The sandwich was ten (10!) dollars and honestly, I just don't think a sandwich should ever cost that much unless it's ginormous or made out of swordfish and gold or something. The people waiting in line didn't look particularly wealthy, but I guess you never know.. The sandwich was indeed tasty, but honestly, it was too rich for me. This is strange because I eat all kinds of bad-for-you, heavy type stuff, but Ike's sandwich made me a little ill. Not food poisoning ill, but too much gouda and sauce and all kinds of other rich things stuffed in it ill. It wasn't a remarkably large sandwich - just rich and heavy. I guess one of the things I look for in a lunchtime sandwich is "light" and "won't bog you down in the middle of the day." I also prefer the homey, neighborhoody feel of M&L Market where you can get a sandwich for $2.50. The people at Ike's were OK, but were lacking in that laidback San Francisco vibe that oldtimers and native San Franciscans often have, one of the reasons I like this city. I also think it's funny that Yelp immediately hid my review on page 4 whereas usually new reviews are featured on the first page. Guess someone paid someone off, eh?
doomsday and kryptonite are clearly winners. Dont leave the city without one.
Amazing sandwiches, lousy location.  No where to sit and the place is literally a hole in the wall.  Directions to the local park would have been appreciated. Great veggie food.
Awesome sandwiches, I'm still craving one a month after my wife and I checked it out after seeing it on "Man vs. Food" I had the Al Bundy and it was delicious. There is a secret menu from what I hear, can't wait to go back when I am in San Francisco again.
There seems to be a never ending wait here for this small, stuffy, and smoky place... but it all makes sense once they serve you up.
Yep. They're as good as everyone says. Super tasty sandwiches (and I don't even like sandwiches!) and something to appeal to everyone. Seriously, so many options. Love the fact that Ike personally hands each customer their sandwich. So totally worth the wait (and yes, it will be a wait).
Ikes! Somehow this place has been here for a year, 5 blocks from my house, without my knowledge. I'm simply ashamed to admit it.Great sandwiches: So far everything has been great. Soft amazingly fresh french rolls, great meats, sauces, fixins. They are messy in a good way. My first trip there I had teriyaki sauce and wasabi mayo dripping down my arms but I was so engrossed in the sandwich I didn't even notice.Great service: They really craft a great sandwich for you, and hand it to you cradled like a baby. Ike recognized my face after my second time there and treated me like a neighbor.Price: You pay $10 for a sandwich but it tastes like $25.
My boyfriend and I are from LA. We are on vacation in San Francisco. We placed our orders via the phone and got our sandwiches one and a half hours later. To be honest, we were disappointed. 1.5 hours is a long wait for two pricey sandwiches so we expected much more. The sandwiches were cold,which is forgivable, even though we weren't really late to pick up our orders. The flavors were OK.Not 5-star impressive though.Not nearly so.Just FYI, we ordered #2 Hollywood's SF Cheesesteak and #100 Eli Manning. Between the two, #100 is better.
Great sandwiches!
Hi there IKEs .If you get kicked out of your current location move to the Lower Haight where you'll be loved and welcome with open arms and man you will be just as busy if not busier . Get a licsense to sell food not just coffee,thats what the news said about you guys but whatever. You guys rock and have to stay in business Please please please dont go.
I had a buffalo sandwich that was off the hook. The sauce was mouth-watering. I have also tried the doomsday and the king koopa. The buffalo sandwich was the best. The bread was made fresh...everything was fresh and I got a complimentary lollipop. Yea!
Went to the one in Redwood City - CRAZY DELICIOUS! You have to try anything on the menu. It's to die for!
Orgasmic. That's right. I said it. It's orgasmic. That's how good Ike's sandwiches are. You'd be hard pressed not to involuntarily utter an "Ohhh" after your first bite of the Super Mario Bros sandwich. You won't find this sandwich on the menu by the way, so it's good you read this review before you went. I can honestly say that this is the best meatball sandwich I have ever had. The sauce and dressing in this sandwich is soo good I swear they must have sprinkled some crack or MSG on it. My boyfriend ordered "the Backstabber," another scrumptious assortment of ingredients. I tried his and was equally impressed. Definitely plan on going back to visit Ike's any time I need a sandwich fix.
There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said. These sandwiches are AMAZING. The extra special dirty sauce guarantees that whichever concoction you choose you will love it. We ordered 12 sandwiches for a group of out of town friends and they all fell in love with Ike's. Seriously, if you want a sandwich just go here. Don't even bother looking at other places!
We're from out of town, and have heard very good reviews about Ike. So we were very excited to finally try the sandwiches from Ike's. We relied on public transportation to get to Ike's and since public transportations aren't always reliable, our bus ran very late and we were about stop away from the shop when we called them to try to place an order over the phone. I should mentioned that the store was closing in 5 mins. We explained to them that we will be there before they close, if not a minute after. The guy we spoke to on the phone was rather short and told us that their system was all booked up and couldn't take the order for us. He sounded like he just wanted to close the shop and be done with the day. I understand we were trying our luck with ordering over the phone, but he could've easily and NICELY told us that he can't, instead of creating some story about his system being "booked" up.
BEST sandwich shop EVER!! When I first heard about Ike's... on the food network I thought hmm...I should check that out. It's within walking distance from my house. I can grab a sammy and head over to Dolores for a picnic. But then I saw the line and I thought...what's so special about this place? So finally I managed to drag myself out of bed early enough to get over here and thisplace is by far the the tastiest sammy spot around! So good...though I do like the Veggie Duck from Love n Haight better. Ike's combinations of flavors are perfect and their prices are reasonable. I'm not so into the line. But what can ya do?
I like their super sandwich, just don't think it's worth $18.
This is the real life version of the Shaggy sandwich, straight out of Scooby-Doo. It is what every sandwich should aspire to be. Hot or cold, the flavors and textures meld perfectly with every combination you could dream of.
Four words: O.M.F.G.Best Sandos EVER.No joke. I came to Ike's the first time sometime last year, based on the super high yelp reviews and fabulous word of mouth. Never been disappointed. At some point it turned into my Sunday afternoon tradition. I've toned it down slightly, because there's gotta be at least a gazillion calories in every sandwich...but come on...you can't have sandwiches that delicious without paying the price somehow. The wait at Ike's is long...really long. There's consistently a line down the block... But just know this - every time I bite into one of Ike's sandwiches, I realize that the painfully strenuous hour I spent starving, waiting to get my food, is COMPLETELY worth every second. I don't know what makes IKE's oh so special...but for me, I think it's a combination of the following things:1. Criss Cross DIRTY sauce: The sandwiches taste really good...its gotta be something mixed in their special "Dirty" sauce! Get extra. 2. FLAVA FLAV: You get fresh-baked bread (half baked in the morning, and full-baked when you place your order), fresh ingredients, and FLAVA FLAV in every bite! 3. MEAT I can EAT: The chicken (and sausage link) at Ike's is Zabihah Halal. If you don't know what that is - it's meat prepared according to religious protocols similar to kosher, that complies with Islamic dietary restrictions...AKA I can eat chicken in my sandos! Yes! And thanks to that, I've discovered the mnage a trios...which is NOM NOM NOM delicious. I love it. You should know though, you DEF don't need meat to enjoy Ike's sandwiches. I've had the Meatless Mikes (VEGGIE Meatball sandwich)...and its uhmazing. Seriously...UH MAZING. 4. Behind the Scenes: The people that work at Ike's are SUPER friendly and fun. When you finally make it to the front of the line, they treat you like there's no one else waiting. You get their full attention, no rush, great recommendations, and nice people serving you. Ike's is awesome! what's not to love?! That's a good question... here are a couple things that I don't love about Ike's:1. The long wait. Yes, I mentioned about that the wait is worth it, but I'd still PREFER not to have to do it. I can't always afford to wait an hour in line or call hours in advanced for my lunch...so visits to Ike's are dependent on whether or not I can sacrifice a few hours in a day for lunch time. 2. Price$ at Ike's menu have gone uppp...and it's hard to talk myself into forking out $12 on one sando all the time. As much as I like to share how great Ike's is, I cant help but feel like the success and attention this place is getting has lead to the unreasonably inflated price tags. 3. There is no space to eat at Ikes. Everything is taken to-go, and it can be a challenge to find a decent spot to sit and devour your sando. All in all, I love Ike's place. I def don't go as often as I used to, but there will always be a special place in my tummy for an Ikes sandwich. Its sad that the place is being faced with lawsuits from the neighborhood... Good luck Ike! You have my vote to stay forever! But if you must move, please move north in the city!
It was bad enough that their sandwiches used to cost $9, but I went there last week and my reuben (the only sandwich I ever get) cost ELEVEN DOLLARS!!! That is just ridiculous. What's more is that they no longer have seating so I had to walk all the way home to eat and by that time my sandwich was cold.
I went to Ike's because of the improbably high number of reviews for a whole in the wall sandwich shop on a side street. The place has been a different eatery like every six months for years. But, they deserve the props. The sandwiches really are sand-tasticlicious!! I think it is the generous use of guacamole, mayo, bacon, and other tasty but fattening ingredients that sets them apart from others. Don't go if you are on a diet. It was crowded all three times I have been, so expect to wait 5-15 minutes for your order. Also, it is really small inside, so I would not go on a cold/rainy day where you have to wait outside or eat on the one inside table.
I saw Ike's Place on the Travel Channel and assumed that it was good based on how the show described it to be...However, it wasn't anything special. I drove all the way up there and waited in a long line for sandwiches that are inferior to Quiznos. Ike's Place is overrated and I probably will not go there again.
I had the Super Mario which is Meatballs, marinara and fried mozz sticks. Ike personally hands you your sandwich. AND there's a bonus caramel apple lollipop in the bag for dessert. Yessssssssssss
Very yummy sandwich. Had the Backstabber and Joey had the Ted Bundy. Short wait because we got there early. So worth driving an hour to get to this place. Would love to go again.
ok, I know this place doesn't need another fan blah-blah-ing about how great and awesome and godsend their sandwiches are. But I have to say it anyway (this is how much I loved it!): Before I met Ike's, I hated sandwiches, mainly because before Ike's, all the sandwiches (and burgers, for that matter) I know are just unrelated stuff forced to be layered between two breads. But Ike's sandwiches, the meat and the sauces and the bread intertwine into an orgy of flavors in every bite. Seriously, give it a try. They are permanently packed, but people there are very nice.
Ike's is by far the most unique sandwich shop I have ever visited...and I visit at least one deli/sandwich shop in every city I visit throughout the country! It is by far my favorite in The City and never disappoints any visitors from out of town that I bring by Ike's. They've got a great staff there that keeps the business running efficiently with a smile despite the never ending line out the door and the stress of working in a fast paced environment. In this class of food, it doesn't get any better in SF....
YUM! I think i first came across this place while browsing Yelp---and then they were featured in San Francisco magazine...this place is a SF treasure. I was a little worried about the lines---but my friend and I arrived around 11:45am and only waited a couple minutes to order, and then about 15 minutes for our sandwiches. I guess it was smart to just come a little early. I am so impressed with their lengthy veggie/vegan menu---it might be a good thing to wait in line so you can actually read through and decide on your order!I had the Menage-a-trois--which was mouth-watering every bite. Seriously, whatever that "dirty" sauce is--it is yum! I love seeing small, neighborhood businesses do so well and have such friendly people working there. It is only a few blocks from BART and short walk to eat in Dolores park on a nice day. Gets a little soggy if you wait too long to eat!
Fresh bread and ingredients, plus that delicious Dirty Sauce, make Ike's my fav sandwich place in the city! The dutch crunch bread is delightful, no matter which toppings/fillers you get on the 'wich, all of which are fresh and tasty, too. My favorite is the Barry B (add Avocado) and I love that the sandwiches come with chips and free suckers! A little pricey, but the sandwiches are filling and awesome. If you have to wait in line, it's annoying, but worth the wait. I recommend calling ahead and placing your order, then you can pick it up and skip the line! Only bummer: they close so early (7pm) & Phone orders stop an hour before closing. Otherwise, Ike's rocks!!
YUMMY!!! Menage toi (sp) is soooo yummy. 45 minute wait on a sat afternoon but worth it.
I've totally jumped onto the Ike bandwagon. I haven't been to the Castro in a while because I had no reason to go, but this was goal today. I ordered the Lizzy's Lips and some fries. I paid about $10 for everything, which I have to admit is a bit pricey. It was not until that sandwich went into my mouth, I thought "I totally got my money's worth." It was like gourmet without the whole pretentiousness of being gourmet. I wish they had an actual space for sitting, but I'm sure they'd have to jack up their prices to pay for rent and stuff (that's just not good for our economic crisis), so the arrangement they've got going right now is okay with me.
They have some awesome sandwiches. Me and my boyfriend were there couple weeks ago for lunch, I had the Jerie's big meat sandwiches and bf had a papa sam (salmon). Mine has roast beef, pastrami, turkey, ham, salami and Jack with dirty sauce. It was little bit too salty, other than that that was a delicious lunch. My bf's salmon was just cooked right. The fish was tender and juicy. Another good thing is that Ike's offers vegan menu too. So thoughtful of them. I am a fan.
I went here during a road trip while picking my sister up from college. I read many reviews here on yelp and saw Ike's Place on "Man vs Food" so I knew I had to try it out. I can't say enough how amazing it was. I got the Lex Luthor and can honestly say it was the best sandwich I've ever had. I wasn't able to even finish the whole thing like I planned, the second half I saved for dinner. Easily worth the price and definitely worth the 6 hour trip up here. I'll definitely be making my way back to Ike's Place, there is no equal!!
All I can say is amazing food, cool people, and worth driving from danville to eat a sammich .... whens the last time you heard that?
I mean, let's be honest. They don't need another 5 star review. But they're going to get one! I won't say much because I'm sure it's all been covered before (didn't read the thousands of reviews to verify it, but I think I can assume). Their sandwiches are freakin' fantastic. And I don't really even eat sandwiches. But I ate my entire sandwich in one sitting (against my better judgment, of course) because it was that good. 'Nuff said.
I used to live in SoCal, and there was a place called Big Belly Deli in Newport Beach that had the best sandwiches ever. I was so sad to move back to San Francisco because I knew I would not get another taste of it for a very long time... But last night, while looking for a place to eat at before we went drinking for Patty's Day, my friend and I stumbled upon here. There was no fuss, just "Oh shit, it's this place! I heard about it on Yelp." So long Newport Beach!! I found an even better sandwich shop in the better part of the state ;)
It's hard for me to give any sandwich place a 5, but this is as close as it gets to a perfect score in my book. Wide variety of sandwiches, very fresh bread, and friendly service. Seating is very limited outside, so taking it to go is your best option.
order ahead of time, super sandwiches
yes, you will wait 1 1/2 hours to get your sandwich.yes, it's worth it.
King Koopa on Dutch crunch! 'Nuff said!
We just got back from Ike's and I have to say that as someone who is not a big sandwich lover these are the best sandwiches I have ever eaten in my life.My wife who is a sandwichaholic...loved these sandwiches so much that she ate 1/2 of one and saved the rest so that she could savor it tonight at home. Now that is a major comoliment on these sandwiches. I had the Paul Rueben and it was spectacular...so delicious.Wife had her own mix and she loved it. Best sandwich she has had since we left New Jersey where they really know how to make a sandwich.
There's a reason why Ike's Place is one of THE top places to eat at while in San Francisco. Ike's has an abundance of crazy sandwiches all packed with crazy ingredients like mozzarella sticks, stuffed jalapeno poppers, beer battered onion rings, etc, etc etc. (I'm getting hungry just writing this review).  The price is good for what you get but be prepared to wait in line or go early, better yet call ahead and place your order over the phone so you don't have to wait.
Ike's sandwiches totally rock! I love the fresh crisp bread, the sauce is to-die-for and Ike is a sweet guy. Check this video on Ike and a longer version of his story will be posted in a few weeks here blog dot thingbuzz dot com
Recently had the Damn Straight. More like Damn Tasty! Ooohhhhh SNAP! This sandwich offers the best of both worlds - their yummy shredded white chicken and fried mozzarella sticks.
Only been to Ike's once and tried their MILF sandwich. I went during the happy hour and only waited 10 minutes. The sandwich was pretty unique and good, but not sure why anyone would wait more than half an hour for their sandwiches.
You probably already know this from the many other reviews, but adding my two cents: vegan meatball sub. Otherwise known as a "vegan meatless mike", this sandwich is so good that having had it the first time I ordered from Ike's Place I'm unable to tell you about any of the other menu options because in subsequent orders I've been unable to bring myself to risk missing out on vegan meatball greatness in order to try something new. That said, there is a sizable vegan menu (check the website), with many other tempting options. Maybe it would be wise for you to start with one of those; if you start with the meatless mike, you may be unable to try the others.
The place was really good. I got my kids a nutella and peanut butter sandwich. I had not idea it would taste so good. We order the Kryptonite. It was a really big sandwich. Four people could have ate it and been full. next time I will try a sandwich that is a little less busy. The Kryptonite was good though.
Holy moly that was a good sandwich. This place doesn't need any more good reviews, but i have to give one. I still have half of my sandwich right here in front of me. I don't know the name, but the friendly cash register guy recommended it to me and basically it is the best sandwich i have had that i can remember. It has turkey and mushrooms and avocado on a perfectly toasted roll. If someone said, take me to the best sandwiches in the bay area i would take them here. and no i dont work there or anything, we just happened to drop in because i was working in the area and was pleasantly suprized. Also the girls that work there are pretty hot. friendly staff. good job ike's.
Not a lot to add, except to say that the Veggie Combo was by far the best sandwich I've ever eaten in my life. Fucking incredible sandwich. Perfect bread, good soda selection, great veggie meat, perfect sandwich spread, perfect everything. I live in Los Angeles and have dreams about Ike's sandwiches. This place is no joke.
I dunno what I can say about this place that hasn't been said already, but their sandwiches are ridiculously slammin'...I don't know what they do, but it makes no sense that I dream about their food...My favorites are the "Name of the girl I'm dating", Napoleon Complex, Mayoose's CA BLT, the ex-boyfriend (go hard or go HOME!!!) & Tthe Phil'em Up's KC BBQ; why the loss of a star? When I call you at 12:15, don't tell me that the earliest I can come get A SANDWICH IS AT 2...C'MON NOW!
Sooooo delicious!
Believe the hype.
I just had the Thanksgiving sandwich. It was wet and yummy. I would have liked more cranberry sauce though, but it was still oh so delicious. I'll try it with a dutch crunch roll next time. Good service, good sandwich. One of the best sandwiches I've had
I visited San Francisco and heard about this place from other yelpers and friends and had to try it.. Let me tell you, all the reviews about this place is 100% true!!! I cant describe it because its that good... If you ever stop by San Fran u must try this place before you leave.... The only bad thing i could ever say about this place is there's no seating area, people were eating in there cars, on the sidewalk, or taking it to go....
Ike's is dankier than Gary Danko!
long line, sandwiches drenched in sauces.
The sandwiches are good but not worth a 2 HOUR WAIT!!! I love a good sandwich like anyone but every time I call in to order one from here they tell me it will take 2 hours!!! I get it...you take time to make a good sandwich which all the mission hipsters flock to before frolicking in Delores park. When I am hungry I am hungry now, not 2 hours from now. Call me impatient. I am happy for your success and I hope ya'll figure out a way to either expedite and/or grow your business to accommodate all the Ike's sandwich fiends in a more timely manner.
Sad to hear that my annoying neighbors won the battle, as Ike's was the highlight of that grim block on 16th. Best choice of vegetarian sandwiches in the city (which most people don't know) - and service always with a smile.
Best sandwich I have ever had!!!  It is a small hole in the a wall place (literally), very hearty sammy's, all orders are to go and infinite number of sandwich choices to choose from.  I had the "Jim Rome" on dutch crunch bread....the bread was oh so yummy as was the entire sandwich. Filled with dirty sauce, pickles, peppers, lettuce, red pesto, turkey and avocado.Hubby had the "name of the girlfriend you're dating" and it was yummy as well. I would make the drive to SF just for a sandwich!!! I will be back soon!!!
ike... you and your sandwiches rock! as a sandwich connoisseur.. i can honestly say your sandwiches make my tummy feel warm and fuzzy inside and make a vegans dream come truemuch lovez
I tried this place for the first time and boy does the sandwich rock. YUMMO!!! They have some crazy names for their sandwiches and some crazy combinations. One order is litterally big enough for two or three people. I orded the superman and man was it good. I had to save the half for later. My only thing was that the meat could been more spread out. Most of the meat was piled high in the middle. There was a lot of meat and it was awesome. Can't wait to go again. This is a must for anyone that is sick of the " five...five...five dawla foot long." Cuz' I know I am. Enjoy guys!
Had the Barry B n it was jus ok so I was disappointed. Hubby had King Koopa n that was definately different but very good! Called it in, got confused on where 2 pickup. Had 2 wait right nxt 2 door n 4 someone 2 come out 2 ask 4 phone orders cuz the guy bringing out sandwiches 4 walk-ins won't help me. Might go back n try others.
The sandwiches are very good, but I don't think they are worth waiting in line 40 minutes (and another 10 minutes until it's ready). And that's when the line is short! Even when counting all the phone orders, it still seems like they are really slow. It seems like they want the line to be long, since it's the best advertisement.. Too bad.
Amazing sandwiches. Just wish it didn't take so long, but the sandwiches are definitely worth it.
With 1411 reviews already, I'll keep it brief: went for the first time today, had the "MILF" and loved it, want to go back for a "Hella Fat Bastard".
I love sandwiches and when I found out I had to be gluten free this is one of the things I absolutely missed. It sucks not being able to go somewhere and buy a well made & delicious sandwich. Then, out of nowhere, I found out that Ike's place has gluten free bread! It was really one of the most exciting days. The sandwiches are fantastic in general. They have so many options and I have never been disappointed. I generally get ones with 3+ meats and the huge stuffed sandwiched look funny on the gluten free bread since the slices are small, but that is perfectly fine with me. My bf loves any sandwich with halal chicken!
"Wow, really? 45min wait for a F-ing sandwich??? Seriously??" thats what I said when i first heard about Ike's....dude, hella worth the wait. Came here over the weekend after hitting up Haight, I got the KingKoopa- meatball sandwich, mozzarella sticks, jalepeno poppers, sourcream, and a whole lotta good stuff. Definitely worth the wait, I'm not a fan of sandwiches but this spot is really good. I came with 4 of my buddies and we all got different sandwiches and we were all very pleased & full.
I've been hearing so many people rave about this place, and I can finally understand why. This joint is a bit small. I have to knock down one star for not having dine-in. Other than that, this is a great place to grab lunch if you love sandwiches. The staff members are enjoyable. I think I saw the owner wearing a king's thrown. Haha They're super friendly and just down to earth. As I was scanning the menu, I noticed that a bulk of their sandwiches are filled with chicken. I wasn't craving chicken at the time, so I asked the cashier what she recommended. She recommended their 2nd popular order, which is Matt Cain. It was simple, but so deeelicious. It had provolone, salami, turkey, roast beef, and their godfather sauce on french bread. I stopped by here around 4pm, and it was packed. I thought it'd take forever for them to create the sandwich, but it was done in a heartbeat. By the way, their Dirty chips are real nice and crisp. My favorite is the bbq flavored. I adore this place. Definitely coming back!
The 16th and Market on Dutch Crunch was amazing. With chips, it was just under ten bucks. I'd like to go back everyday to try every item on the menu. Stopping by here was a great decision.
Very good! I tried the "Ex-Boyfriend". The dirty sauce is really great, and the whole thing is really good. I look forward to trying more sandwiches whenever I'm in SF. In my opinion, this place is really good but not quite worth the really long wait (I lucked out - the line was relatively short when I went). Little Lucca's in South San Francisco is just as good.
WOW. I can't believe I waited 2 hours for a sandwich, but it was well worth it. I kept seeing great reviews for this place so I decided to try it. When I walked up and saw the line I couldn't believe it -- there were about 20-30 people in front of me and the line was moving very very slowly. By the time you get to the cashier it felt well worth it. I got the Koopa, which was HUGE and I'm still stuffed from yesterday. Overall great place, friendly staff, and awesome sandwiches.
best sandwiches ive ever had in my life..go here, DO IT!will the thrill for the win!
So for the last few months I have been hearing from people how great this place is. I know people who are obsessed with this place and they obsess over it. Also Mr. Man Vs. Food Adam Richman was there and there is a big picture of his grande head as soon as you walk to order the sandwiches. So I decided one Tuesday morning (before the big crowd shows up) to order what Man Vs. Food ordered himself and that's the KRYPTONITE. OMG that was the biggest sandwich I ate in my life. It was the only meal I had for the day. I did a calorie count for it and it came out to 3500 calories!! haha. It was worth every calorie but I felt really tired and sleepy for the rest of the day. I went weight lifting also that evening and it was really tough to concentrate. I wonder if there's something in the dirty sauce or dirty bread that makes you collapse.Anyway I think it's the best sandwich place I have seen in SF and in the Bay Area. It's not the best sandwich I have ever had in my life (Personally I think there are delis in New York and L.A. that are better) but it's good to know that if you want a good sandwich you don't have to go to Subway or Quiznos :D. Definitely call to order your sandwich on the phone or show up before 11:30 AM or else you will be waiting forever.
There's a reason for all the hype: Ike's is one of the tastiest sandwiches I've ever had! I ordered the [Name of the Girl I'm Dating] which is comprised of halal chicken breast, honey mustard, avocado, and pepper jack, all on Dutch Crunch! (dutch crunch is a must!) The first bite was like a party in my mouth. The dirty sauce really hit the spot. All the flavors really complimented each other; the sweet dutch crunch with the smooth texture of the avocado and the saltiness of the sauces. MmmmmMMMmmm food orgasm. And each of the sandwiches come with a free bag of dirty chips! :)The downsides are the small portions, the suuper long waits, and the price. The sandwiches are on the small side, which is not really worth it for the $9-15 price range. If i really want a tasty sandwich for a reasonable price, I would go to Little Lucca's in South City for an amazing sandwich for $6-8. The sandwiches are huge and delish. Although, the lines at both sandwich shops are really long. Ike's is not very efficient at getting their orders done since they don't bake their bread for you until you order it. I waited in line for an hour just to place my order. I should have called in an order; I heard that's faster. Then I had to wait 20 minutes for my sandwich to be made. Boo. I suggest that you go to Ike's before you're hungry, so by the time you actually are hungry, you get your sandwich.All in all, Ike's is a great joint, despite the long waits. Hurry and get there before they close down!
Oh come on. Really?Called ahead and ordered a Spiffy Tiffy, so the line didn't bother me at all.Sandwich was dry, way too much chicken, dirty sauce didn't help at all. Flavors were muddled and mute. I love my sandwiches, but this really had nothing to offer me. Gimmick.I couldn't bring myself to start the second half of it.I won't shed a tear, to be honest.
I think the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because my expectations were so high. Very good sandwich. I got the Eli Manning and my wife got the Pizzle- both were good. I highly recommend a visit. The owner was there and nice enough to take a picture with us. The location on 16th is being forced to close from what I understand, so hurry.
Great place and lives up to its reputation as a great sandwich shop. Lots of choices on the menu, all of which are great. I've been working my way down the menu and have not found a sandwich I dislike yet. Ingredients are excellent here and are definitely on the higher end. Get your sandwich on the dutch crunch bread. The only downsides about this place is the line and the lack of a place(chairs and tables) to eat. At peak hours it gets a little ridiculous if you're just walking by and you felt like a Kryptonite. I highly suggest you phone in your order if possible. The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars is that Bonne Sante in Burlingame is a little bit better.
I know that this review is completely unnecessary, and it's not going to make one lick of difference, but I just need to review it FOR ME. They make the best sandwiches in the world. And when i moved back to new york I nearly begged Ike to move with me. When I was looking for apartments in San Francisco I SERIOUSLY considered getting a place in the castro just so I could be near this place. I'm really not that crazy, their sandwiches are just nutty good. I don't need to recommend any sandwich because it really doesn't matter what you get. And, everyone who works there is so cool it makes me nervous.
Yup, 5 stars. One of my top spots in the city to get a sandwich if you're willing to wait in line. The "dirty sauce" is a must. If you like roast beef, I'd highly recommend the Nacho Boy. Enjoy! My only gripe is that it's overpriced.
Weeks ago I had the " Change" for lunch. It was a rib eye sandwich with onions rings and BBQ sauce and other things which I don't remember. It was a generous sandwich lathered in BBQ sauce which overwhelmed the sandwich. You couldn't figure out what was in the sandwich with all that sauce. 4 stars for the generous portions.  Didn't care for the dry mouth experienced at night with what I perceive to be MSG. This is a sandwich which would best be had once a year. I'll try something else next time.
Heard about the place from a friend at work and decided to try it out.First visit I got the roast beef + swiss, which was very tasty, then the next time I got the Super Mario (meatballs + fried mozzerella sticks) and it was even better.The vegitarian gf got the veggie BLT and she loves it (even the fake bacon part, which is a pretty rare thing).The secret is to phone in your order ahead of time and then pick it up.
Have been wondering about any place that ALWAYS has a line. You expect it to be that place where if you don't know the system they will yell at you or something (maybe my experience from living in Chicago so long) but anyway, the people working there - AWESOME, friendly, nice. People in line also nice and patient. Great bottled (non-alc) selection and of course, of course the sandwiches. I couldn't get over the amount of vegan options. We had the reg dirty californian and the vegan cow tipper - tasty goodness.
The dirty sauce was SOOO GOOD!!! you have to try it!
I got the hot roast beef sandwich with avocado and mushrooms(forgive me for forgetting the clever name) and it was drippy, messy yumminess. Maybe I am missing something or maybe it was just left off, but I could not figure out what the dirty sauce was, which was a bummer. The dirty sauce got so much hype by all y'all!! I'll be back for sure since it's so close to my crib...and because they gave us caramel apple lollipops.
Amazing sandwich! Period. Great menu to choose from, friendly staff who really seem to care, and did I mention delicious? I showed up around 3:45 and there was a line of about 20 people, so be prepared for that, but it moved quickly.
As a disclaimer, I prefer fresh, cold sandwiches to hot ones. The sandwiches here are huge and filling, but I didn't feel like they were anything special. This might have been because we called in for pick-up and were late, so the sandwiches were soggy and the bread wasn't crunchy anymore. I think the sandwiches would definitely taste better without being smothered in paper for 20+ minutes.Service was pretty good, but the place is TINY and there isn't much room for the five or six people who are in there at one time. Even though we called ahead, they estimated a lengthy 1.5+ hours for the sandwiches to be ready. When we rolled by at 1:30, the line was still halfway down the block and there were a bunch of people who'd already ordered waiting for their sandwiches to be made.
I had the Tony Soprano. I have yet to try the dirty sauce, since this came with Italian dressing. DELICIOUS.
this place is all hype. if you like oversized sandwiches with a lot of crap in it, then this is the place for you. the fact that they have so many different types of sandwiches on their menu just goes to show that they just throw random items together and dont know what the hell they are doing. some of the sandwiches taste HORRIBLE. they need to just focus on their top sandwiches instead of adding disgusting sandwiches that their employees make during their breaks to the menu.
If your smart, you will call in and order ahead. However, the hour and a half wait is well worth it!! this place is soooo good! to all the neighbors who are trying to evict Ike....suck it!!
Sandwiches are great. Last time I went we ordered a docpop and pizzle. Both were delicious but they lost our phone order so I had to wait for them to make it again (they were super nice about it). The place gets packed though so I always order before I get there. Lots of selection; never had a bad sandwich, but can barely finish it. Not a light meal :)
Amazing sandwiches. Just visited SF for the first time this weekend and a friend wanted to try this place after seeing it featured on Man v. Food. You know it's a good sign if the line is long and when everyone is eating, no one is talking because the food is good. I got the "Say Hey" and highly recommended it. The apple/carmel lolli was a nice touch, haven't had those since high school!
Went here on a little jaunt to SF from Seattle, and the sandwich I had became the main thing I told people about when they asked how my trip was. Naturally, the question 'what made it so good?' was always asked, so I had to figure that out, and what I came up with was balance. Yeah, the ingredients were all well-combined with others, the bread was fresh and delicious, and all the parts tasted good, but what made it great was that nothing was overpowering; there wasn't too much bread, bales of lettuce, or landmines of pure tomato - there were the right amounts of sauces, and it was toasted, but not charred. That's as close as I can get to describing a damn good sandwich. Wait in line while it's still there. Worth it. (Oh, and another dude named Ernie gave me my food. +2)
so my friends and i saw this place on man vs. food and just had to check it out. any sandwich that is named after any men in a giants uniform is just fantastic with me. hit this place up before a concert and oh wow, i could barely finish the whole thing .it was only because the episode on man vs food had warned me about the size, that didnt eat all day for the occasion :) the food network never lies, just sayin, definitely go.
I heard about this place for a long time, finally made it over there. Amazing. No wonder there is almost always a line half way up the block. These sandwiches are magic. I recommend the Veggie Backstabber.
Delicious vegan sandwich options available and very friendly staff. I was about to order some salt and vinegar chips but they were informed and thoughtful enough to inform me that they were not vegan.
I still give this place 5 stars even though:1. It's too small to handle the biz... 2. Effing appointments for a sando. Puh-lease...3. The massive man-dookie out front the last time I went. (not dog dookie, trust me).Other then the above mentioned small issues, this place rocks.
Okay, I'll give it a 4 star. I like the sandwiches a lot. They definitely do a good business and offer a lot of variety. After I eat one of these, I'm not as full as I'd like to be, but a bag of chips can sovle that issue. The dirty sauce is good and all of the ingredients are fresh.
When people ask what my favorite food is I often hesitate because after all I live in the Bay Area and I have eaten at some of the finest restaurants around. And while I do love me some fine food, if I am being honest a good sandwich would be in my top 3 fave foods! Kinda like Joey from Friends :) If you have had the great gastronomical pleasure of indulging in an Ike's sandwich and motor boating in its dirty sauce you can imagine my extreme pleasure at being introduced to Ike's!! The bread = amazing. I prefer the dutch crunch. They toast it = divine. The put dirty sauce on it = orgasmic. Then they pile on whatever you prefer. The Tony Soprano remains one of my faves. And vegetarians will delight in its veggie sandwich menu! Two of my best friends live within a block of this joint so Ike recognizes us as the sandwich lovin' posse we are and always stops to say hello in recognition. He is so sweet if you put dirty sauce on him, I might even bite his cute little head off! I kid, but you get my point. It is almost always busy, so call in an order and you will be very thankful. It cracks me up when people drive by and see a line around the corner and wonder what's up? Ike's sandwiches is what's up, so get out of your car and get in here! You won't regret it!
AMAZING! I have never ever ever had such a good sandwhich and I eat A LOT of sandwhiches!! We went here after seeing the Man Vs. Food episode (like everyone else!) and I can not say enough positive things. The menu is huge...like 100's of sanwhiches huge. It is impossible to narrow it down.The ony downfall is the line! We stood in line for about 30 minutes then had to wait another 15 for our food. The girl working said during lunch it wraps all the way around the street. It is so so so so so worth the wait!
I like Ike's! Love the sandwiches. I've tried the SF Giants (turkey, bacon, mushrooms, avocado, swiss) and the Girl I'm Dating (Halal chicken breast, honey mustard, avocado, pepper jack) and both were excellent! Two main complaints, one is the wait seems to be super long at all times (but with so many good reviews I'm not surprised at all) and there are so many damn choices of sandwiches it can be tough to choose.
The reason this place stuck out in my head was because it was on Man Vs Food obviously.. and for good reason. This place is amazing. They have a sandwich for every one - Dirty Sauce sells the sandwiches. I had the "Hella Fat Bastard" which was killer, and my girlfriend had the "Ex Boyfriend" which was even better. The people there are so bad ass, super nice. We mentioned it was my girlfriends birthday and they gave her a free meal right there. Great experience. The only thing that sucks is there is no table to hang out around there, but I guess that's part of the experience. Just grab your sandwich and head to Dolores Park to eat.
Kinda long line and borderline pricey for a sandwhich. However, nice staff, great sandwich. It really is good.
I live pretty much live across the street and always see the lines out the door. I got a bbq sandwich and it was super satisfying... it's amazing how popular the place has become! I am happy they put seats outside.. worth a stop on your way down 16th street.
All I have to say is WOW. We love this place. The bread is great, warm and crunchy. I say waiting in line is well worth it.
It really is as good as the 1200 reviews say. I've been a couple times and Ike makes a damn good sandwich.
What a combo: Montana to Rice - so perfect with the super bowl wins and what a perfect sandwich, which is just as good as that combo. Real meatballs, pepper jack and, of course, marinara and some dirty sauce (garlic pesto) on dutch crunch. Wow! the best meatball sandwich in the city by far! THANKS IKE.
Great sandwiches! The dirty sauce is key! LONG ASS LINES
Damn! Very rarely do I change my plans, just to come home and write a review, but here I am. That is an incredible sandwich. I had the Ex-Boyfriend, which consists of salami, bacon, avocado, cheddar and a whole slew of other fixings, served hot on sourdough baked to order. I can say that this is one of those rare culinary experiences that transcends itself. It's genre defying. Spellbinding. Ike has created a monster!
My girlfriend and I went all the way to S.F. from San Jose to try out this sandwich shop. Upon arrival, we noticed that there was a line...a line?! I anticipated that the sandwich was going to be nothing short of delicious.I ordered the Jeries' BIG Meat Sandwich, and it really was a BIG MEAT sandwich. All of the meats that i ever tried in a sandwich was in this one.My girlfriend wanted to order the CA-BLT with roast beef instead of the bacon. When she asked if there was such a thing, Ike told us that it was called the nacho boy. She got the nacho boy. That shows the depth of their menu. They have about 200 sandwiches!! Crazy!My first bite was extraordinary. I really cannot describe it, but the aroma of the sandwich had me trippin'. After that though, the meat was too overwhelming. I think it was because I was getting full off of a sandwich, which I never do!Only finishing half of her sandwich, my girlfriend also agreed that the sandwiches here were zesty and flavorful. I took a bite off of her's, and I thought it was better than mine's. Oh yeah, the bread is perfect. They toast it to perfection.Thanks Ike!
I drive over 60 miles each way and have waited in a line for 2 hours just to get a bite from Ike's. Weather it is an event in the city, or just a craving, san francisco isn't the same without this sandwich. I can't seem to stray from "sometimes I'm a vegetarian" add turkey. Its SO good! SLAMMIN. Juicy and salty and vinegary and crunchy. I also got me and my friends "free ike" shirts today. Gotta support him!! They also have an awesome vegan menu for my friend who can't eat animal protein, so she can order just about anything also! I've taken everyone I know there, and told everyone I've met about it. Its Extreme flavor, extreme names (hilarious) extreme size, overly fair price, hecka awesome people, and best of all, Ike in his trademark Blue Fur Jacket eating an ice cream cone on a rainy day.
I love you Ike's. The dirty sauce is amazing and leaves you wishing you ordered two sandwiches instead of just one. Personal fave's: Napoleon Complex, Change, Pride of the Castro and Lincicum. I always call it in, cause I just cant stand waiting. Wish you were closer though!
This is the 1,323rd review for Ike's. What else can I add that the majority already hasn't?? OMFG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Within a week of moving back to the Bay, one of my dearest friends said, "You're from SF and you've never heard of Ike's?" I was taken aback. "Umm, no, what is it?" "It's one of the best sandwich shops in the City!"All of a sudden I felt like a moron, "What is she talking about? Who is this Ike that she keeps referring to?" So I asked my BIL who knows everything and anything about The City and he didn't know either.Whew.So I picked the hottest day for us to try it. When we got to the corner, I saw about 20 people standing in line and thought to myself, "F---, this place must be good." We managed to find parking fairly easily, but the line was so daunting. We were already there, so we had to go through with it, right? There were only two tables outside the restaurant, both preoccupied, of course. Dozens of people just standing there waiting. And every so often, I noticed this one guy walking in and out of shop with orders. Finally, I stopped him and asked, "What are you guys known for? Which sandwiches do you recommend?" Cause mind you, there are no paper menus, you have to wait till you get to the door to see the menu on the wall and there are A LOT of sandwiches to choose from. PLUS, they have even more sandwiches listed underneath the board. So, unless you already know or you checked the website before getting to the restaurant, you need to ask someone for guidance. "Ike" was nice enough to give me his recommendations and finally we made it to the counter. It's very small inside. I "think" there were five guys making the sandwiches and one cashier. For two sandwiches, two drinks and one bag of chips, it cost $ 27.00. We waited FORTY MINUTES in the heat for our sandwiches that day. The whole time we were waiting, we kept noticing other groups standing around and MORE people approaching the shop. We said to each other, "Holy shit, this place must be good. Look at all the people! And 'all this' for sandwiches!" We didn't want to get carried away, but at the same time, we couldn't help but get our hopes up. I mean, by the end of it we had stood in line for forty minutes for sandwiches. But with all that said, the sandwiches were DELICIOUS! I ordered the Lincecum, which was good, but my BIL ordered the Matt Cain and that was THE SHIT, mostly b/c of the garlic aoli sauce. Mmm mmmm. The bread was delicious. Nice and crusty on top but moist and soft inside. It was perfect. I can't save that it was "worth the wait," but I will be back. As we stood there waiting, we discovered that there are even MORE sandwich choices online and if you place your order over the phone, you can have your sandwiches ready for pick up. If memory serves me correct, you still have to stand in line to get to the counter, but that still saves time. That is the plan for round two.
If i can give this restaurant a 10 star I definitely would. This is by far the BEST SANDWICH EVER that entered my mouth. Its so flavorful and so DEEEeeeelicious. I ordered a salami unoriginal without the mayo and cheese and OMG, heaven!!!!! So good. The price is VERY reasonable and its a very reasonable size. You dont get the rinky dink mini sandwich. Even though there was a long line to get in and place the order, the order came fast. This will be my to go sandwich joint. I've been working in this neighborhood for over 2 years and just discovered this place. I am glad you are in this neighborhood, but I cant have you everyday. Just on paydays.
Yeah, that was damn good! First time there. Got the vegan "cheese" "steak" sandwich. Call ahead! Looo00OOOoooong line, even in the rain, son. Sandwiches are extremely good, they have some sort of magical secret crack sauce up in that b.i.
Best sandwich place in the city, you can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches. Menage a trois is my favorite, the chips are good, and they have great options for beverages. The people are very friendly too. I would recommend this place for everyone.
Ike's a scholar and a champ. I really enjoy the Empire Cola he has stocked there, so I asked him if he could hook me up with a case of it if he was ordering more from his distributor. Unlike a lot of restaurants that have websites with contact information, he promptly answered my e-mail and said he was glad to help me out. No less than a week later I have a case of the delicious drink... I'm hands-down recommending this place to friends and visitors forever. Sometimes, it's about the people, people.
There is only one way to eat at Ike's on a weekend. CALL AHEAD. If not you will be stuck outside, possibly without a chair, waiting for an hour for two freakin' sandwiches that you're wondering why it's so hard to make, since there are 4 efficient sandwich artists + 1 cashier, and only 3 groups ahead of you. That's because of all the gazillion smart people (who you're about to become, dear reader) who did call in. Now you're stuck in a virtual line behind them, and you have nothing to do because after three years together you don't really have anything left to say to your boyfriend, and you left your iPhone at home, and it's way hotter this weekend than you expected, and you can't take off any clothes and remain appropriate, and the only thing left is to watch the Mission hipsters strut by in skinny jeans and puffy colorful vests, for a full hour, while you just want your stupid sandwich so you can go to the park and read. Not that I'm speaking from personal experience or anything. You already know that Ike's sandwiches rock. I recommend the Reuben and the Tony Soprano.
Back when I was single I dated a lot of different women, and if they broke up with me I used to warn them that in a few weeks they'd be begging me to take them back. They'd laugh in my face but inevitably in a week or two sure enough they would call, wanting me back, because they had realized that no other man could possibly compare. Basically you can say the same thing about an Ike's sandwich: once you've had one, any other sandwich pales in comparison. Any other sandwich you can name, and I do mean ANY, is but a distant second to one of Ike's orgasmic creations. In fact I think the owners should start thinking about coming up with another word for their products, since to describe one of these epicurean masterworks using the same term used by Subway or Togo's seems grossly unfair. If the making of a humble sandwich can be called an art form, then the staff at Ike's are the Rembrandts of the industry. Suffice to say, if you have never eaten at Ike's, you are in for a rare thrill. That first bite of an Ike's sandwich can be compared to your first night of bliss with that special someone: a moment frozen in time, something that will linger in your memory forever. The magical combination of ultra fresh ingredients, the perfect blend of sauce and spices, so perfectly arranged on the highest quality bread. One bite, and you know your life will never be the same. And for those of us in the North Bay there is good news. Ike's, that Valhalla of Victuals, is coming to Santa Rosa - 1880 Mendocino Ave to be precise.
Top notch, I havent had a sandwich that I didnt love, and I've tried quite a few.
Sandwiches taste ok, but are really small compared to other deli spots. May need to give this place a second chance. But my inittially reaction, the place is o-k.
An hour and fifteen minute wait to get a sandwich? Are you crazy? No, because these sandwiches are crazy good. I stood in line, got sunburnt, paid $25 (of someone else's money) for two sandwiches and two drinks. They were amazing, I got the "Cristina and Umair Go to Ike's Place". Would I go back? Hell yes, but next time I would order ahead! (Also, if you have a web enabled phone, just use it to pass the time and know what you want before you get up there. The menu is enormous, and there's only one up at the front.)
I'm gonna keep this simple. Yes, there's often a long wait. Yes, the sandwiches are a little on the pricey side. But what you get will be one of the best damn sandwiches you've ever had.
Down in SF visiting friends and used Yelp to find a hot lunch spot in the mission/castro area -- stumbled upon Ike's and it does not disappoint! Ike (and his Mom) are extremely friendly and made me feel like I was having a sandwich at home -- the weekday crowds (before 12:30 at least) aren't too bad and the food is simply top notch. This isn't your everyday sandwich shop -- Ike has plenty of wild and crazy sandwich creations and hand crafts each sandwich with a little SF love (although he pulls off the I'm from philly look pretty well).I ate here two days in a row -- first I had the backstabber which is simply delicious -- light, refreshing, but very filling. The Caesar sauce, artichokes, and chopped chicken breast come together on soft, fresh bread to truly delight the tastebuds. It's one of the newest creations and I HIGHLY recommend it as an Ike's starting point.Last night a buddy of mine recommended a secret creation not on the menu called "Super Mario" -- it's your standard meatball sub but Ike adds fried mozeralla sticks to the creation and warms it in the oven to create a gooy, tasty, comfort sandwich that rivals the best of 'em. If you are in the mood for meatballs this sandwich can't be beat (arguably one of the best meatball sandwiches I have ever eaten, and the scale tells me I've eaten plenty!).If you find yourself anywhere near the Mission/Castro in SF this place CANNOT be beat -- it is a MUST DO. He has a healthy following so if it's the weekend call ahead because you can't just walkin (crazy I know, but lots of rabid fans)
Yes, there is a line. Yes its worth the wait. Its so good that I wish they would triple the prices just so I could get my food faster. Enough said.
you know you've found a great place when you feel like you can recommend this place to nearly anyone and that person will probably like the place just as much as you do.ike's place is honestly awesome. the sandwiches are delicious. the people are friendly. the prices are reasonable. and every sandwich is made consistently well. the last time i went, my bf and i ordered the name of the girl i'm dating and a vegan meatball sandwich. we ate the vegan one first and let's just say we both thought it was the meat sandwich. Their dirty sauce is so yummy and get your sandwich on a dutch crunch. i don't think you can be disappointed with anything on the menu.order in advance because it can be a pretty long wait sometimes!
Best sandwiches I have ever eaten, and I've had my fair share.The ingredients are top notch and super tasty. The dirty sauce is just the perfect condiment for a sandwich. I love that the bread is baked along with the ingredients (except the produce of course) on it, so the whole thing comes out warm, toasty and crunchy, with all the juices coming through.Always get the Dutch Crunch bread and get extra dirty sauce.I've got a list of 31 sandwiches (out of over 200!) that I am working on. Have conquered more than half that list. Each and every sandwich has been a winner, with of course some amazing standouts: Pride of Castro (add Pesto), Going Home for Thanksgiving, Menage A Trois, Napolean Complex, Al Bundy, and the Get Over It.Also love their selection of sodas.Well worth the wait, but try to go right when they open to avoid the lines and make sure all the ingredients are present. Have had some ingredients sell out when I've ordered past 6:00pm.
How far would you go for a sandwich? How far would your imagination take you to the point of tingling your taste buds?Ikes Place has been the highest on my bookmark list for at least a year. Seeing the astounding number of reviews, reading all the praises of oohs and aahs, and drooling over all those close up pictures beautifully taken from the thousands of yelpers, my expectations for an Ike's sandwich started at a Skyrocket level.  So, when I finally placed my order by phone for two sandwiches (Nacho Boy and Lincecum) to be picked up at the end of the day, my anticipation was nearing the boiling point! Whew! But, it didn't just end there... noooo the anticipation had to be worked on more... make that a LOT LOT more before I could actually sink my teeth into these guys. On our date night, my husband drives us to Ikes' Place. Not knowing exactly where the new location is, he drops me off on 16th and market. I eagerly look for a bright blue sign as I trot down market street. Halfway down the block, I realize there is no Ike around. First thing that comes into mind, ask the "locals". A florist and a customer at the corner of 16th and market - surely they would know where Ike's is. "Excuse me, do you know where Ike's Place is?" Blank... blank stares that is what they gave me. In my mind I'm thinking: "Don't tell me you don't know what I'm talking about! Come on! IKE'S!! The world's famous sandwich?!! Parlez vous Francais????" Finally one of them speaks! "It's down the street around the corner towards Sanchez" the florist says.  YES! Run, baby run, it's 6:58 PM, and they close at 7 PM. I have only 2 minutes left! Hold those sandwiches for me Ike's peeps! I'm comin'!! I run down 16th and Sanchez. No Ike's in sight. What was he talking about? The area is a residential area.  Desperate, I run back one block to the car telling my husband to call the phone directory to find out the exact location. He dials. "2247 Market street" he says. I run back down the block still looking for a bright blue sign. None. It's okay, focus girl... look for the number. "2247" Huh?? A bar? Go in... Cheeringly greeted by the bartender... "Uhmm, is there Ike's Place here?" "Oh, they moved to Sanchez." "Sanchez! I just came back from there I didn't see any Ike's! And stupid phone directory!" Run back down the block. Heart pounding. Stop. Look around. Across the street. What's under that scaffolding? IKES!!! IKES!!! I FOUND IT sweetie! And it's STILL open!! We'll have our sandwiches honey, for our date night!!"And that will be $24." "$24??!! Wow! For 2 sandwiches?" At this point, I think I would have paid $50 with all the workout I did just to get to this hole-in-a-wall. But they better taste like the BEST food I've ever eaten in my LIFE!!Once we settled to find a place to eat, my husband and I FINALLY got to savor them. 1. The Dutch Crunch bread was definitely the best I've ever tasted. The secret dirty sauce was certainly full of flavor. 2. But the size of these sandwiches was definitely overly hyped. I was able to finish my whole sub in one sitting and was still hungry! = Minus 1 star.3. The filling was pretty scarce too. I expected a heavily and generously packed sandwich full of meat. But, these sandwiches look pretty standard for $11 = Minus 1 star. I am satisfied to have tried an Ike's sandwich as of today. However, I also know that I wouldn't go back for more, out of my way, given how expensive these subs are. America's best tasting sandwich? It's all relative... but, my MOST memorable "Sandwich Quest Experience"? Most DEFINITELY!!
I've only tried the Kryptonite, the Tony Soprano, and the Menage a Trois. They were all delicious. The sandwiches are pretty complicated for sandwiches. They're big and juicy and flavorful. Not really light like you would imagine a typical sandwich to be...
The line might take a while, but it's kind of a good thing. It gives you time to look through their massive menu and decide on what you want after much contemplation. Ike's is hands down the coolest and tastiest sandwich shop. Everyone has got to try this place at least once.
This was my favorite place I went in San Francisco, hands down. The other reviewers have nailed it, so all I want to say is that I miss you, Ike's Place! Fed-Ex me sandwiches, fellow Yelpers, so that I can relive the best food of my life here at home 1500 miles away.
Yeah... it's that good.
It is all true. It is even better than the hype. Meatball sandwich, with fried mozzarella sticks and jalapeo peppers IN the sandwich. Genius. Nuff said.
So once again it's been quite awhile since I was here. But this place is very memorable! you have to wait in quite a line to get a sandwich though, so hope you're not in a hurry! It's pretty good though, prices are decent, and the place is very entertaining! My friend and I were laughing while we were reading the names of all the sandwiches, it helped pass the time. Although I cannot remember what I had anymore, or what he had, but I would definately go back! Oh seating is also really limited. Too bad I live so far away from it though....
Saw ikes on man-vs-food &been dying to try it.with my trusty s.f. tour guide(my sis) we headed out to locate this sandwhich wonder.there was a little bit of walking.involved since it was the weekend &we were in s.f. we found ikes&I was pleasantly surprised there was no huge line.with 2people ahead of me i tried to read the menu.the staff was super friendly& let me stand behind the counter to.see it since I.forgot.my glasses.my sandwich was the lincecum. it had ham,turkey,bacon,lettuce,havarti cheese&ofcourse dirty sauce.my wheat roll was hot&toasty.the sauce was the perfect amount.we copped a squat right outside&began our feast.sis ordered a sesame street(vegetarian)&she said it was the bomb.my sandwich had me full@the half way point.I'm glad I saved the rest cuz after our hike back to the car I was hungry for more.I will definately be back for more. The only drawback is no seating to eat.
ike's is sooooo good. i call ahead in order to avoid that crazy line! menage a trois and nacho boy!!! mmm getting hungry just thinking about it. reasonably priced too for that big ol' sandwich.
I like their sandwiches. They always remember my girlfriend. They don't remember me but that's okay because I never call in our order.
Just absolutely fabulous! I always get the Lincecum. And they have gluten free bread... yay!
I found Ike's Place on the website of Man vs. Food a long time ago, but my husband and I have never been there until today afternoon. We got there around 2 pm. and were surprised when we saw the long line. Employees were passing menus to the people in line and answered any questions they were asked. They have a great variety of sandwiches! I had the Thanksgiving style with Dutch crunch, turkey, Havarti cheese, cranberry sauce, bacon and Sriracha (which I was concerned about, but I asked the guy, who took our orders and he convinced me that the spicy-sweet flavor goes really well together, so I asked for reduced amount and it tasted really good). My husband had the Monte Chase-O with Dutch crunch, turkey, ham, strawberry preserves, lettuce, tomato and Swiss cheese. One bag of chips comes with each sandwich. Both sandwiches were really really really good!!! Something very different than I had before. It had the perfect amount of meat in it. (Many sandwich places think that if they crowd a whole bunch of meat in your sandwich that's all that matters...those are the places where I have to take out half of the meat after I get my order.) I would have put a little more cranberry sauce on my sandwich, but it was still awesome.We were there on a Saturday afternoon, so I guess the line is usually long at the weekends. We waited about 30 minutes in line and another 20-25 minutes for our sandwiches, but it was worth it.The staff is very friendly and try to work as fast as they can. My Mom is coming to visit this month and I'm definitely taking her to Ike's Place!
Does this place really need another great review? It's awesome. The meatless meatball sandwich rocks!
This place is great! Believe the hype! My friends and I love Ike's sandwiches, and Ike is pretty cool too since he walks around handing people their sandwiches.. I couldn't afford to eat here often since it's a bit pricey, but you're getting a delicious high quality sandwich. You'll also get a free bag of chips with your sandwich. I recommend.
try everything on the menu at least once, you will not be disappointed!
no lines as we went on a wednesday at 10:30am. The Menage is gangSTAR. . The sandwich is Voltron. it's a combination of lots of smaller parts that merge and unite to form a ginormous mound of awesome. Somewhere in that kitchen i can imagine the final assembly and as the sauce is being poured a small voice can be heard, "...AND I'LL FORM THE HEAD" i would have to say this is a close second to my all time favorite Sandwich shop here in Seattle....PASEO's! YEAH!!!
Every time I eat at Ike's, I wonder why I bother eating anything else. And then I remember: the wait is often agonizing. Lucky for us, sweet Ike has expanded his hours, allowing those of us who are less than patient and have zero forsight to call in orders to enjoy his dirty, dirty sauce.
poor ikes too bad they cant coexists with there neighborhood because this place makes hella good sandwiches. i would definitely call ahead here as they are always busy and always have a line.wherever you stay or go ikes ill be there
If you're a sandwich lover like me, Ike's Place is a "must go" sandwich shop. On June 21 I had the best sandwich in my life. I ordered Manage-a-Trois, item 111 on the menu. It was a Halal chicken breast, real honey, honey mustard, BBQ, pepper jack, swiss served on dutch crunch and drenched with their special "dirty sauce". The sandwich was to die for. Oh, sometimes you may have to call in to order because the line can get pretty long. My first time I got there at 9:30am and had to wait an hour for my sandwich but it was well worth it. I'm gonna eat at Ike's again sooner or later, hopefully sooner.
So took my g/f here for her birthday lunch because she is a big Sandwich Fan. We live in the Napa Valley and we have a few good places for sandwiches. Well we both loved our sandwich! It was better than I thought it would be. When we arrived around 11am on Friday it was pretty busy. The line was about a 10-12 minute wait but worth it. I think the wait was longer than it could have been but the woman taking the orders likes to chat with everyone so that adds on minutes to everyone's wait! Other than that BRAVO you have a wonder and delicious sandwich shop.
OMG Ike, what is your dirty secret?? Your sandwiches are scrumptious!!
Have you heard of the bay area sandwich tour? Well it's a list of the best type of sandwiches at top delis. So Ike's was on that list as #2 for the Menage a trios sandwich. I tried it over the weekend and that sandwich was so delish that I couldn't stop thinking about it the next day. Even Man vs. Food went there. I really really can't stop thinking about it. I had a bite of the paul Rueben as well. That sandwich is also good, but I'd pick the mnage a trios over it. I have a gut feeling that I will be back pretty soon.
The only thing I can say about their sandwich called 'The Super Wario' - "I don't see what anyone could see in anyone else. . . but you. . ." -The Moldy Peaches
Life changing sandwich. That is all you need to know.
I love me some M.I.LF!Spicy, fresh and creamy, everything a sandwich could be. My mouth is watering thinking back to that oral experience. I'll keep going back, so should you.
Great sandwich and I could eat them 6 days a week. Standing outside in the freezing cold for 45 mins waiting for the sandwich just not worth it. They were about $8 and definitely worth it, they were awesome. I just cant get over the wait. We called it in a second time and still had to wait 30 mins once we got there, even though we called in the order. They told us 45 mins, we waited 45 mins and then still had a 30 min wait = total 75 mins for a sandwich!!
All VEGANS out there you gotta try this place! Now im someone who's a vegan "part-time". Yes I know its weird, I mostly do not eat red meat but occasionally during birthdays and parties I would go grab a bite to eat some red meat. Anyways back to my point, the veggie sandwich is hella good here! Seriously what i just love in this place is that they somehow process it in a very magical way that leaves your stomach TOTALLY satisfied, its hard you to know to eat something vegetarian and be full but Ike's place always makes me so full! I would def recommend getting it with the dutch crunch, everybody is already raving this place....why bother read my post when you should just fucking try it(pardon my language) but yes this place is awesome. VEGANS.......go try their vegetarian sandwich you will not be disappointed! Oh and the price is really cheap for what they offer, i got a big load sandwich and for only 8 bucks! Totally gratifying.
Most amazing sandwich shop in the world. or universe. everything is amazing. even the staff is amazing. I will miss you very very much Ikes.
Sandwich and fries were good, but for $18. Place is pricey, but I guess if you want good food, you better pay the extra bucks for it!
ok ok.. i think i need to come back for round 2 because I don't understand what the big deal is. I ordered the menage trois sandwich and it was very average... actually I am pretty sure they gave me a different sandwich than I had originally ordered. The chicken was overly shredded so it was quite mushy. My bf ordered a cheeseburger... and he liked it.. but was it worth a 30 minute wait???? NO WAY! So I will come back one more time in hopes to be wowed but my expectations are not high.
Kudos for having gluten free offerings, from rice bread to bbq sauce. Sweet! And dude, people eat dinner there. Who eats sandwiches for dinner?
The Super Mario (meatball marinara & mozzarella sticks) was yummy! :)
Mozzerella sticks in a sammie? Ummmmmmm......5 STARS!
If the line at this place wasn't so long, I would give them a full five stars. The food really deserves it, but I started waiting in line at 1pm on a Saturday and didn't get my sandwich until 3pm. Luckily, my friend had printed out the menu at home so we had an ample amount of time to decide what to eat. [You should do this because the menu is only posted on the storefront. I think they have a few menus but it's just faster and easier if you have your own copy.]We sat across the street in front of the library to eat our sandwiches. [This is a convenient location because of the bathroom inside the library.] The sandwiches were delicious! I got the Lincecum sandwich with turkey, ham, bacon, avocado, and havarti on a dutch crunch roll. It was pretty big and came out to a little under $10. Everyone enjoyed their food. They give you a caramel apple lollipop for dessert too, but since Ike's is so close to Bi-Rite, we walked over for ice cream instead. I would come again but maybe try to call and order ahead so that I don't have to wait so long.
They got my order wrong, but my sandwich was good. Very filling, lots of meat, yummy sauce. The wait was crazy and it was 6:30p...I won't be going back anytime soon.
I never understood why people got really excited about a sandwich but now I understand. I even had lunch and dinner there yesterday. Great vegetarian options too!
not sure it's worth the wait or the attitude but to sandwich was good!
Best Sandwich I have ever eaten! The service was friendly and fast! I love this place. The sandwiches are GIANT!!!! Can't wait to return!!!!
seriously... how could good can a SANDWICH be? right?NOike's was seriously... amazing. i wasn't expecting much.. even though there was a longggggg line in the afternoon. the place looked run down a bit, workers were literally taking their sweet time in making sandwiches, though there were manyyy people waiting. but they were very nice. i think we seriously waited over 30 minutes... 30 to 45 minutes. as a fellow yelper instructed to get a name of girl im dating on a dutch crunch, we followed suit and were VERY glad of having done so. the chicken is like... shredded. not a whole breast of chicken, which made it easier to take bites and chew. and it was much tastier than a regular breast of chicken. and they add all this goodness to it, i dont even remember but the flavors melded so well together. and the bread! wth is dutch crunch!? i don't know but GET ITgiven the long wait and no seating, i would come here when i'm not hungry so i get hungry by the time i get my sandwich. otherwise, i would be really cranky. i'll probably come back here the next time i'm in sf!
The best sandwich I've ever had in my life. No joke, I drive 3 hours from Fresno, CA for the "If I were cute" sandwich. I do not have enough words to describe how tasty these sandwiches are. If you do not eat Ikes before you die, you are missing out on a real treat. Do yourself a favor, eat an Ikes sandwich. You will thank me.
I can't say enough good things about this place. super creative, and very friendly service. I'm one of the pickiest sandwich people alive, and this place is killer. Order an original or make your own - you can't go wrong. It took me a while to try it after hearing all the hype, but I'm SOOOOO glad I did. I can't wait to go to the redwood shores location, and Ike said he's opening one in Stanford too (near my hometown). ShUHWEEEEET!!!!!!
Oh man, I thought I'd never have a sandwich as good as the ones my mother used to make me on fieldtrip day (don't act like you don't remember fieldtrip day). Subway, Togos and Quiznos can now all exit the building, Ike's is my new love! I got Lizzy's Lips and it was beyond comparison! It was so good I was actually sad when it was over. The flavors were all distinct (the chicken, the cheese, dirty sauce and Italian dressing) and complemented each other nicely.The only draw back is that there's no place to sit and savor your masterpiece properly. You're gonna have to stand or eat in the car (like we did last night). Otherwise, the staff is fantastic and friendly, the food is great and the beverage offering is pretty good too. They had all the normal stuff (coke/pepsi, sprite, etc) plus some pretty out there stuff (organic chai cola). Do not hesitate, hit this place up immediately!
Alright so I was skeptical about how amazing a sandwich could be and now i am a believer! I got the Meatless Mike which is a meatless meatball sandwich...it was better than any meatball sub i've EVER had! The french roll was amazingly soft (which i guess makes sense since they bake your roll to order), the sauce left me absolutely speechless. I didn't order fries but my friend did so I stole one and I've got to say, they're pretty damn good (nicely flavored and not too greasy either!) I will definitely be back to try everything else on the menu!
yep, it's that good. just the freakin line.. oh goddess.
I can't really say anything that hasn't been said 1000 times previously. One of the better sandwiches I've ever had. My only suggestion... Bakesale Betty style pile of ironing boards and folding stools, because they need a few more places to sit.
OMG. I got the kamikaze. Biggest Sandwich I have every had. And also the most expensive. 20 bucks with tip. Sad to say, I'd do it again.
Nice little spot in the castro. Rolled up there with my lady Monday to be greeted by a huge selection of sandwiches and burgers. Add a star for the creativity and another for bump'n Company Flow. Word.
The only reason I give this place 4 stars and not 5 is because they really just don't have enough seating for EVERYONE that wants to come eat here...why...because this place is GOOD.My fiance (who UNFORTUNATELY enjoys killing animals and eating them) is happy here because they have a lot of really great sandwiches for him to eat. I am very happy here because they have over 20 vegan friendly sandwiches. With all kinds of faux meat, veganaise and vegan dressings that taste oh so yummy.The dudes that work there are really chill...they all make fun of eachother and call eachother ugly and are happy to have you do the same. They also are quick to recommend a sandwich thats way better then the one you just ordered. Like "instead of the turkey club, try the Super Sonic Turkey Bird...it'll give you super powers"They have kettle chips which is where I FIRST fell in love with them (thanks Ike...now I can't stop buying Kettle chips).Any place that names a sandwich after the worlds best plummer (Super Mario of course) is a-ok with me. Now they just need a Yoshi sandwich...word on the street is that Yoshi is UN-HAPPY about this.Watch out Ike...you could be hearing from the Yoshmeister!
Might be the best sandwich I've ever had! Not sure if it was the sauce, but they put some lovin goodness between that bread... Well worth the trip and slight wait for the food!
Most delicious sandwich I've ever had. And that says a lot. Oh, and they give you a lollipop with your sammy! Amazing!
Ok, I don't get this place. It's not bad, and the owner and crew definitely are friendly, but I can't remember anything that really stood out about the six sandwiches our group ordered.  I might go back if I was in the neighborhood and didn't have to wait 45 minutes for a sandwich, which means I probably won't go back anytime soon.
Ike's is turning into an addiction. I mean, gawd, it's so good. It's never "yeah this is a good sandwich" or "yeah not bad" it's like "oh SNAP, my endorphins are up, my senses are heightened and whatever's happening in my mouth, I wish I could share it with you." Ike has really done something special and created something awesome. For a carnivore like me, even I'll eat a vegan sandwich here. I love the Meatless Mike. The #9 [Name of Girl I'm dating] is just terrific - avocado (my vice), honey mustard, pepper jack and that awesome chicken. Not only is it terrific, it's original, it's inventive, it's like no sandwich you've had before. Yeah you can get a decent Italian sub somewhere in the city, but you can't get a sandwich like this.
read the reviews. decided to try it, hoping I wasn't expecting too much after all of the praise. Turns out a place like this actually can be BETTER than the hype. i called ahead, then hopped a J train up to Ike's...by the time I got there my sandwich and amazing fries were ready...and Ike was even there, as nice as all the reviews make him out to be. overall a ridiculously pleasant experience and food that blew me away.go there...well, CALL and THEN go there...you won't be dissapointed
This is how good Ike's is. I waited in line for about an hour to order. Then we waited for another several minutes for our sandwiches. As I was waiting I was thinking to myself, " This sandwich better be godly." After eating my backstabber, I immediately told myself I was going to order another sandwich the next day. That Change was so good!
My girlfriend went in and asked them to make the best sandwich ever for me.They actually did make the best sandwich ever, just for me.
As many have said before, it really is the best sandwich ever. Period. There's no competition or doubt. Reasons why it is the best sandwich ever:1. Dirty sauce, obv. It's like some sort of magic aioli, I suppose, but I really have no idea what the ingredients are.2. The fresh, toasted bread that's crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.3. There's no need to make alterations yourself. Everything on the menu is as it should be already, so don't fuck it up, because the people that came up with this menu know much more about sandwiches than anyone, so just trust them.4. The perfect meat:bread:vegetable:sauce ratio. Word to other SF sandwich places--a good sandwich does not automatically mean 2 lbs of deli meat.I also love this place because of the service. It is, just looking at the Yelp reviews, an SF institution, but unlike most "institutions" (every big city has them), the service isn't pretentious; as a newbie, you don't feel like you are an outsider entering some sort of secret club and if you don't spit your order out fast enough the counter person gets impatient, cause you're not in the know. Here it's not like that. They are helpful, and actually make suggestions as to what kind of bread, sauce, add-ons, etc that go or do not go well with your sandwich. So, as the other over 800 reviews of this place will tell you, go try it.
Ike's is probably the best sandwich place in the city for many reasons. They have a huge selection of sandwiches, both meated and unmeated. Their ingredients are quality and tasty and the sandwiches are about the perfect size. I had a Christine and Umair go to Ike's without ham or cheese (Turkey, salami, bacon and avocado) and my wife had a garden burger. Mine was excellent. Her words were, "it's got all the normal ingredients for a garden burger, but everything just tastes better." When I asked for no ham, the lady at the counter taking my order asked if I would like additional meat instead. This is a far cry from the normal nickle and dime b$ I get at most sandwich shops. Lastly I need to say that the service was fantastic. It's the kind of place where you expect to be rushed because they have a line. Once we got to the counter, the order-taker was very kind, polite and was very helpful. All in all, a wonderful trip.
Ikes' is fantastic. One needs to thoroughly evaluate the menu online before they go. I think they have something like 100 sandwiches, which can be very overwhelming. I went on a sunny Friday afternoon (foolish, very foolish) and waited about 25 mintues to order. I waited another 10 until the food came not. Not bad considering the numbers these guys do on a daily basis. So tasty, so delicous, and filling. If I lived closer I would go here on a much more frequent basis. The best sandwiches in the city.
Ahhh... Ike's Place, I have heard of this place from my friend and said it was one of the best sandwich places in sf. One day my bf and I drove by Castro and decided to check it out. When I got there, surprisingly the line wasn't as long as I thought it would be. There were 10 people in front of us and the line was moving a bit slow. Luckily for us we got there before the rush hour and the line started to get a bit longer. I order a pastrami sandwich and my bf got thin slice beef sandwich with jalapeno popper in it. This gentleman brought our sandwich out and I was so excited to give it a try. Mine was good, but wasn't as great as I expected. My bf said his was so dam good that it gave him orgy in his mouth. So we both swap half of our sandwich and dang his sandwich was a lot better than mine. It was pretty good, but not sure about the orgy part. LOLSo I would recommend others to try this place out. Highly recommend adding jalapeno popper in your sandwich. Make a big difference.
Ike's is hands down the best sandwich I have had in ages, if not ever. I stop by at least once a week with some friends to gorge ourselves on sandwiches. Every time I go in, I choose something different. At this point I have sated my appetite upon 6 different sandwiches and have joygasmed over everyone of them. I recommend the 'Paul Ruebens' on dutch crunch (a creative reinvention of the classic Rueben). Make sure to take the time to chat with Ike, who is regularly on the scene, or one of his staff. If it's a nice day outside, have a seat and enjoy the passing characters of the Castro. This is a must eat for all sandwich enthusiasts (of whom I am sure there are many). Long Live Ike's!
I would eat here everyday if I could afford it...both financially and weight wise. I LOVE their freaking sandwiches. The best in the city besides Molinari.
Super delicious yummy vegan foodies! Happy hour deals rock, too.
The sandwich is an art and it takes a lot of love to make a good one. So far, good sammies are hard to come by in this town and I eat them almost every day from different places through out the city. But then I found Ike's and I'm very happy. Great selection or sammies and they have a creative and very tasty vegetarian and vegan selection as well. Not to mention Ike and his mother who run it are sweet as can be. Only thing is that it's a small place so usually you have to get them to go or go in the off hours to get one of the four tables (two are outside) that they have available. Regardless, I see a bright future of Ike's, they're so solid. In fact, I'm going right now.
Great sandwiches. Very incompetent service! I tried to place an order by phone today. Dick, who answered my call told me to come wait in line like everyone else. Thanks Dick!
Just righteous :)
Delicious to the max and worth the hour-and-a-half weekend wait. Though if you really can't stand waiting in lines, call ahead two hours before you're planning to eat. Or, go at off hours (weeknights after 7, for example).
While visiting California, my brother took us to Ike's. Ike's place is a delicious sandwich shop in SF's castro district. I was super excited to try this spot since I saw it on Man vs. Food. Be sure to get there a little early for lunch because the line can get really long. I ordered the Jim Rome which had turkey, cheddar, avocado, and their special pesto sauce. The red pesto sauce and avocado made the sandwich. It comes with a canned soda or drink, and a bag of chips. Since there is no seating, we took our food and had lunch at Delores Park. It was DELCIOUS!
sandwiches are good, but pricey. also don't like that you can't order things like mozzarella sticks independently of a sandwich (don't want them soggying up my sandwich).
Amazing!!! Best sandwich we have ever had!
We went here on the recommendation of my friends 9 yr-old son. He saw it on Man vs. Food (some cable show) and really wanted to try it. We heard we should call our orders in ahead. The 9 yr-old foodie got through with his order at 11:45, pick up time 1:45. Yes, 2 hours later. We called our order in at 12:05, after calling back several times trying to get through(starting at 11:50), getting only a busy signal for over 15 minutes. But we were determined, our pick up time: 2:20. Their website does mention something about a state of the art phone system, I think they are joking. We didn't mind the later pick up time because we were going to walk from Folsom and 8th and on a mission from our 9 yr old captain. We arrived and kinda stood around, looking at this enormous line, hoping we didn't have to get in it. Now here the inside tip I can share, you don't have to stand in the enormous line if you called in. You just go to the register and pay, they bump your order up and in minutes your sandwich is ready. The website lists about 189 sandwiches. I chose the Paul Reuben, my hubby chose the Date for Hire. MMMMM........... I can't wait to try more. The food was amazing and the sandwich runner was bleeding great customer service. We definitely will do it again.
This place is so yummy. My friends decided to meet here for dinner. We all get sandwiches, I also get fries. They were wonderful. Crispy with some kind of delicious seasoning. My sandwich was the Meatless Mike on Dutch crunch Roll with all the fixings. We all were thinking these things are huge no way we will eat them all, but after finishing one gigantic half we were so enamored with the taste we couldn't stop eating. Will definitely go back and sample other delicious sandwiches.
they serve over 100 sandwiches. ive never seen anything like it. vegan, veggie, and meat sandwich menus. some burgers too. i got the Rome (i think... there are so many stupid names i couldn't keep them straight), which had turkey and avocado as the main ingredients. it was one of the best sandwiches ive ever had. the bread was soft and chewy. everything was fresh. the spread was killer.
I tried this place for the first time a few days ago. I am vegetarian and love all the options. My boyfriend and I both got a sandwich and had half of each. They were both great. I just read that white people love expensive sandwiches. I don't know if I love expensive sandwiches, but I do love sandwiches and I would much rather buy a $7-8 sandwich here than in the financial district. I can't wait to go back and try more sandwiches.
The hype is real!! These are some grubalicious sandwiches i want to take in the bushes and have sex with....what? Nevermind, the number of selections are a little overwhelming, like 70 choices, but there's usually a long enough line for you to make up your mind. It was pretty interesting experience too.  It looks like the whole family is on this sandwich production line which is crammed into a tiny, tiny spot. They remind me of some kind of sandwich gypsy mafia. Wow, all good though...can't wait to take another sandwich into the...
Very tasty sandwiches........
Yup, that's a good sammy. I had to wait 1/2 an hour for it, and it then took me 15 mintues to find a place to sit down and eat it, but it was tasty. Also, a pretty good bargain for the price.
This place was great! I'd been eyeballing it for a few months every time I walked past, but there was always a huge line & I was always in a hurry. Finally, after stopping by the library for a little Christopher love (both Moore & Isherwood), I saw my chance! No line! I scurried over & started chatting up the front line girl about what I should order as an 'Ike's Virgin.' She recommended a 49er, so I went with it. While I was waiting, she sweetly & patiently answered all my curious questions about the business--even though I started to feel like a two year old continually asking 'why?' (well, how *do* they bake the bread fresh & keep their orders timely, I wondered). Ah, insatiable curiosity! My sandwich was ready in about 15 minutes. I grabbed it & dashed home, feeling like second Xmas had come. When I got home, I put the sandwich on a plate before unwrapping, which was excellent anticipatory planning on my part, because damn, if this wasn't the messiest sandwich I'd ever seen. Ooey gooey & sauce dripping from every angle. AND SO DAMNED DELICIOUS. Wow. It was the perfect combination of sweet & spicy, a good blend of overall flavors, and tasty, tasty, tasy. Definitely several napkins worth to make sure I didn't end up accessorizing with it, though. I ate the whole thing, my lips burning with peppers, and was completely satisfied. And at the end? I pulled a cotton candy lollipop out of my bag, and leaned back with my fully gestated food baby contentedly curled up in my belly. C'est magnifique!
the s.f. location is now closed but don't worry! the redwood city location is my favorite and so much better. there is also an ike's on the stanford campus and be on the lookout for burlingame and santa rosa soon.
My two sandwiches there were both fantastic. Definitley lives up to the hype.
I've been there about 10 times, in order for them to give me the chance to change my 5 star rating to something less, and I can't do it. These are the best sandwiches I have ever had. Not sure if it's their sauce or the Dutch Crunch bread, but there's something magical there. It's worth the money (oh, most sandwiches are big and can be shared with somebody anyway) and definitely worth the wait. Before you rush out there, let me tell you about the wait. First, the lines are long. Secondly, if you wait in line it could easily take an hour. Knowing this from previous experience, the last time I called in my order from Dolores Park and was told it would take an hour and ten minutes. So I got to work on my tan a bit, and by the time I walked over, the order was ready to be picked up. I'll be back again, and again, and again.
Ike's does NOT live up to the hype. I ordered the backstabber: chicken, artichoke, provolone. It was good, but tasted like a million other good sandwiches I have eaten before. There was nothing special about the sandwich that would justify more than a 5 or 10-minute wait. The bits of chicken that fell from the sandwich were stringy and dry. The only reason the sandwich itself was good was due to the sauce, which gave the chicken flavor and moisture. In addition, I've eaten cheaper sandwiches at other locations that were just as good.In Ike's favor, the service was very courteous. The cashier actually acknowledged me and smiled as he told me to enjoy my sandwich.Final verdict: The prices and the taste don't justify the wait. Basically, I would not return to this place unless there were no wait.
Great little sandwich shop in the Castro on 16th. Almost too many sandwiches to choose from. Veggie and vegan sammies as well. I had the Barry b. and I added avocado to make it a 756, turkey, bacon, and Swiss. It was absolutely delicious; fresh and warm, great bacon, I think an entire half avocado, on rye. Truly great! Also great staff... And they're all hot.
We came here after reading the reviews on yelp and it was great. I ordered a burger and my wife ordered the salmon sandwich and it was worth the wait. The only thing is that its super tiny and theres only two tables outside, so most people were just sitting on the sidewalk. So I suggest you take-out and enjoy at a nearby park.
I don't get this place. I have tried it now 4 times. The menu is huge but seems to have repeats of the same ingredients over and over. The sandwiches are drenched in the "dirty" sauce which is super oily and makes the sandwich super soggy within seconds. The meat/bread/cheese is not of good quality. I am just not getting it!
Really good sandwiches for a good price, but the only thing is the wait, but if you call in your orders, then you're fine. Defiantly have to try a sandwich from this place.
One thing I have to give them is there selection. Supporting well over 15 different types of sandwiches. I had their doomsday in one sitting and it filled me to capacity a huge sandwich. I suggest calling in to order your sandwich that way you don't have to wait in line to pay or even wait in line to just order.
Personally, not a big fan of sandwich, but Ike's is an exception. It's sooooo GOOD. I don't even mind the mess I made while enjoying it. I've been there twice since my bf persuaded me to give it a try a couple of weeks ago and definitely plenty more to come. By the way, Happy Birthday!!!
There's just something about the sandwiches from Ike's when I'm eating one I'm going eh, it's ok, but when I'm hungry I CRAVE Ike's sandwiches. I do love the selection. I've yet to work my way through all of their sandwiches. I also like all the unique sodas and chips they have to go with your purchase. The lines can be long though. The best thing to do is call and then go down to pick up your sandwich. Usually within 20 minutes. If you want your sandwich during traditional lunch hours, good luck to you! You will be waiting forever.
I had the Super Mario...wasn't expecting that mozzarella sticks would be so good, but it was awesome! We went at 1 pm, and for such prime lunch time we had a reasonable wait time. I'd totally go again in a heartbeat, delicious!
Love Ike's! Love the people who work here! I love the sandwiches. The people who are trying to shut Ike's down are big stupid jerks. Your loyal customers are behind you 100%.
Was in town on Business and a friend suggested I stop by if possible. I am glad as hell I did. I chatted with Ike while waiting in line and he gave me the scoop on a new sando not even on the menu yet called the Mark Cuban. It was one of the best sandwiches in my life. I would kill to get that sauce recipe in my grubby hands. I hope Ike's plans to open a new location in the southland happen sooner rather than later.
I love this place!!! A friend of mine introduced me to it as we were heading to Delores for a day in the sun. I had the " going home for thanksgiving" and it was one tasty sandwich. Very filling with all of the freshest ingredients possible. This place always has a long wait so FYI call in ahead of time.
There is a reason this place has such great reviews...seriously good sandwiches. But! Be ready, we got there at 3pm and didn't eat until almost 4pm....so don't stop by for quick pick up. Luckily though, their menu is insane, so you have a lot of time for trying to decide what you want to do. Everything tasted fresh, and the bread particularly knocked my socks off! With the wait, I probably won't be much of a regular, but it's definitely worth a stop at least once while you're in the neighborhood!
Drove from Sacramento to eat here. It was sooooooooooo yummy. I ordered the Kriptonite and my BF ordered the Doomsday... It was super delicious. I recommend this place to everyone. Only one complaint... Missing my avacodo!!! Lol... That is all. :)
Take any ingredient you can think of, high quality of course, throw it between a dutch crunch roll, give it a crazy name, and serve it with a smile and lollipop...the result one of the best sandwich shops I have ever visited.
The only reason I have doomed the four-and-a-half star Ike's Place to three stars is because of the constant deterring line out front. But if people are willing to wait, then it usually means whatever is at the front is well worth it! This is the case at Ike's. After you sink your teeth into one of these satisfying sandwiches, you forget about how long you waited in the cold... definitely one of the best delis in SF!P.S. It's also a great addition to a day at Dolores Park.
The Haiku-er Reviewer Presents... Ike'sHot Mamma HudaI need extra napkins pleaseCrazy delicious!
Definitely more than worth the wait. First time there i had the menaj, Halal chicken with sweet bbq sauce, next time i had the ex-girlfriend, always stay with the dutch crunch.
some kind of wonderful..long before man vs food!my favorite sandwiches & selection pretty much ever. So why 4 stars? a.) someone might read this if I dont put 5 starsb.) I never get to eat it! I mean I just dont have that much time! (This is actually probably a +1 as it keeps me from looking like a manatee)c.) boyfriend ordered a king koopa, waited 2 hours--then got the sandwich with the notice they were out of the mozz sticks. This literally ruined his, and in turn, my Sunday.On the other hand, I have a difficult name and always use fake ones when I order, but Ike told me it was beautiful and that he would have named the shop after me if it was already, you know, Ikes. As you can see, it's easy to get on my good side. NOW GO HAVE A MENAGE A TROIS!
There are only two sandwich places in SF that I like. Ike's and Tartine. Pastrami (Say Hey at Ike's) is my choice. Unfortunately, both have a huge line when I'm actually hungry.  There is something so perfect about Ike's combination of toppings and fresh bread. All the flavors and textures enhance each other to create a sandwich I became addicted to.
Over-rated. Ridiculously slow. Sloppily made. Gimmicky. Would be heckled and closed on the East Coast for not being able to make a sandwich in less than 20 minutes. Honestly, just another place where Bay Area people enjoy waiting on line for something mediocre.
The sandwiches are above average... although the price isn't! Friendly service + above average sandwich - pricey = 4 Star Ike! :)
Glad I got to enjoy this place before the neighbors banded together to shut it down. Yup, in a retail site that was a ghost hole for years, the success of Ike's has the neighbors steaming mad & have petitioned the landlord to evict Ike. That's how we treat a successful sandwich shop in this town, by giving them the boot with a side of NIMBY. Undoubtedly, he'll open somewhere else, but heaven help the next person unaware enough to try to make a success of themselves on a block where that is, apparently, beyond the pale.
Believe the hype. These sandwiches are delicious. You'll find something you like because they have about a zillion options. I normally like my sandwiches dry but I make an exception for the dirty sauce and I don't even know what it is (don't tell me!).
I really like their sandwiches. Lots of variety and their air fries are good. Pricey though, $18 for a sandwich, drink and fries. YUP!
This place delivers! I took my girlfriend here on her birthday weekend for a late afternoon bite and we were very happy customers. The vegetarian options are incredible. I had one of the best eggplant parmesan subs of all time (Called the "Stupid Eggplant Sandwich") and my girlfriend claimed her "Christine's Strawberry Something-or-other" was the best sandwich she had ever had... period! I'm excited to try the meatless metaball and cheese sub. The owner told us that people often get up from their seats after sinking their teeth in with a frightened look on their faces because they think the meatballs are actually real. Yum! You will not be disappointed with Ike's!
My family and I found this place about 2 years ago. We CRAVE it! We live about two hours away and when anyone in our house says, "Ike's" or "dirty sauce" we start to have issues. My 10 year old son said the other day, "I think we need to go and see a guy named Ike." =) Are the lines long? Yes. Who cares, it's worth it. We've been there enough times to know better and call ahead, but we end up in line cuddling, chatting, and people watching all in anticipation for the world's most amazing sandwiches. We highly recommend the "Hella Fat Bastard", "Hot Date for Hire", and "Barry B." sandwiches. Get your sandwich with extra dirty sauce and you won't be disappointed!
45 minutes for a sandwich seems a little excessive, but The Manage-a-Trois on Dutch Crunch was worth it! If you are aware of what you are getting yourself into, then you will not be disappointed. So pick a nice day, bring a bottle of water and prepare to enjoy the scenery of this colorful neighborhood! BONUS: We met Ike and he is AWESOME!
this place is simply amazing.
my taste buds were in heaven!! the dutch crunch is awesome!! the manager is very appreciative of his fans coming to great lengthens to taste his amazing creations!! The trip from LA to the bay was worth it!!
This was my first yelp experience and literally the best sandwich I have had in my life. I am super picky and wasn't too sure about trying anything outside of my comfort zone of sandwiches, but i am SO glad I did. Ike was there helping with orders, and you get a Tootsie pop with your sandwich! does it get any better? i am telling all of my friends about his place! if you are anywhere in the city, find an excuse to come to this fun hole-in-the-wall miracle of a sandwich shop. you WONT regret it
Simply put YUCK. My food was cold, the wait was way too long.  The space outside was dirty.  It's over rated. But the final straw was the cook's hair in my food. Ike's has a bunch of 16 year old kids working behind the counter and it shows. My perecption is that I'm scared to think what's in the Dirty Sauce. I've heard all this stuff about him getting kicked out of his space because he's a bully. Maybe some of it's true. But this should be about my sandwich. Well the MILF was soggy, SMALL and no need for a return visit. IKE I think ITS time for you to go
The sandwiches here are on another level compared to Subway or Togo's. The sandwiches are really good here, but it didn't blow me out of the water. Mike is very friendly and down to earth. The bread was very fresh and the meats and veggies were really fresh. You can't go wrong with ordering the Nacho Boy. The sandwich look kind of small, but they are very filling. Good price for a good sandwich.
If you ever need to confirm that you are indeed not in NYC, this place will do the trick. The Sandwiches are pretty overrated, not bad, but not worth the wait. No where near what you could get at a decent deli in NYC. For my money the best sandwiches in San Fran are at Molinari's. Not worth waiting for.
This is the best sandwich shop that I have ever visited. The workers are nice, and they bring the sandwich to you instead of yelling your name. I ordered the We're Just Friends sandwich, and it is the best. The chicken was shredded and was slightly overcooked, but the tangy sauce and avocado made up for it. I wanted to get the Dutch Crunch Roll, but they ran out so the cashier suggested the French Roll, which was very good. I really enjoyed my sandwich when it was hot. The roll was toasted. :)
Had to wait a long while but defiantly worth the wait. Awesome sandwich and girl taking my order was super friendly. I always appreciate a place that maintains friendly service even when they are jam packed. If you haven't been there...GO!
Quite quite good. They wouldn't let me get it dry, they said that the reason I was there was because of their Dirty Sauce lol. I hate mayonaise, but it was well hidden and i was taking a risk. It was really good. Got the vegan turkey and damnit it was good!
Yes. Yes. Yes. Go here. Most amazing Reuben. And 150+ more sandwiches. Excellent bacon. Great attention (Ike's super friendly). A true find.
ike's is a solid sandwich place. after seeing the line from the window of Tangerine across the street, we decided we must try it out, so we went back the next day.first of all, beware -- the line can get really long. BUT, they take orders over the phone -- phew!the first thing you'll notice when you go to order a sandwich at ike's is that they offer a sh*t ton of sandwiches. i mean, WARNING: if you are indecisive, either don't go to ike's or, better yet, have someone order for you.the sandwiches all have great names -- i ordered up a "Do You Smell What Barack is Cooking?" (ribeye, bbq, smoked gouda) and my mom had the "Pizzle" (chicken, bacon, ranch, and cheddar). they were both solid sandwiches -- especially the Pizzle. not the best sandwich i've ever had, but i can see why ike's is popular. :)
I'm a huge fan of a good sandwich - I'll often eat one every day of the week. Ike's makes a great sandwich (or maybe 100+ great sandwiches) and the ones I've tried have been really solidly good and pretty good for the price. But honestly, waiting 40+ minutes for a sandwich is a waste of time - I could have eaten a sandwich and been on with my day long before I was halfway through the line - and I'm just not convinced their sandwiches are that much better than plenty of other good sandwiches all over town.
Tried this joint out the other day.... worth the 1 hr drive for their Pizzle and i think it was the tony sandwich. Sandwich was full, filling and juicy. Friendly staff. Think they do need another register that works. Hahah! They were using a calculator instead of the register. Great sandwiches though.
Yum-O!!! My husband and I decided to try Ike's after watching the Man Vs. Food episode they were on. We were not disappointed at all. The sandwiches are fabulous, and very tasty. One would have been sufficient for the two of us to share, but, we each got our own and tried each others. We were happily stuffed and could not even touch the chips. The price is just right for the amount of food that you get here.There is no seating inside the shop, so you order at the door and then wait and they will bring the food out to you. We will certainly go back there when we go back to San Francisco.
tony soprano and the montana to rice. amazing. flavor bursting through my french bread, into my straving belly. probably the best meatball sandwich i have ever had. messy- yes, worth it- absolutely. and the caramel apple lolly pop one the side? thank you. must come back!
i was gonna deduct one star for the long wait, but the fact that people flock to this place and line up around the block for a sandwich really says something about this place.all i gotta say is... ommm ommm ommmm! best sandwich ive ever had!
Best sandwich ever. Period. Another reason to go back to San Francisco. A bit too crowded though.
This place is really good!!!
Delicious sandwiches with a unique menu. If you plan to visit Ike's on the weekend, I recommend calling in your order and picking it up so you won't have to wait in a long line... Just make sure you let the person at the register(you don't have to line up) know that you called in. I had the Eli Manning and I loved the zesty garlic and herb sauce. My boyfriend had the Change and our friends had the Kryptonite, which was HUGE. I definitely want to visit Ike's again and try a new sandwich every time I go!
Please get the vegetarian Not So Sloppy Joe with EVERYTHING on it. Yes, everything. You will not regret this.
Ok, so I'll agree with the rest of SF: its a damn good sandwich. On the other hand -- the wait is insane.
IKE"S PLACE = YOU ARE FANTABULOUS! :)4.5if parking wasn't so bad, and if they had a place to sit down and eat (well, i did have a place to sit down and eat, but it was extremely limited ... you're looking at 10 chairs and 3 tables at most) then this would be a fat 5 stars or more... oh, and it's extremely stuffy inside ... makes you wanna gag ... BUTTTTthis place definitely has some yummy YUMMY fo yo TUMMY sammies ... i went to their website and this is the blurb that stands out as you read their page ..."This ain't your momma's sandwich shop. Or your dad's. Or your gramma's, cousins, dog's or cat's, spiritual advisor's, CEO's, or hamster's. We offer hand-crafted, finger-lickin'-good, fresh-baked, so-good-that-every-description-is-hyphenated, delicious sandwiches to the masses, made how you want them, be you meat eater, vegetarian, or veganite."i agree with it like no other ... :))))))tons to pick and choose from, and lots of fun and cute names to go along with it ... ranging from $7 and up, it's seriously a great deal .. they're seriously quite the size .... ;) even though i could eat the whole thing, i'm watching my weight as we speak, so i ate half and saved the half for later...ingredients and the combinations are superb... extremely creative and fresh !!!the guys who make this happen are super friendly and super nice ... MY GAWD, THESE WERE DELICIOUSLY EVER SO TASTY!!!KEEP IN MIND, IT WILL TAKE AT LEAST 10 MINS, BUT ITS WORTH IT!TIP: you like me who plans in advance, and likes to get 83068302609286 things out of the way? just do yourself a favor and call in and place your order, pick up @ a designated time, take a quick bite, ok, maybe, 3-4 bites, SMILE, wipe off the condiments off your fat cheesy lips, sanitize your hands from eating it animal style, SMILE (once more) and drive off. ITS THAT GOOD ...
Great warm sandwiches! Get extra dirty with it. Opt for no lettuce. It makes the sandwich taste so much better w/o it. The only downside..waiting in line (15+ min) and there isn't a place to sit and enjoy this heavenly sandwich. The staff is very friendly. Many options to choose from. I dropped a star due to the lack of seating to eat unless you are comfortable sitting on the sidewalk. Ike's having problems with the neighbors, so I'm not sure if that's a great idea.
this place is magical. pure magic. also?they are super considerate. blow pop lollipops in your vegan combo sandwiches? because they KNOW tootsie roll pops AREN'T vegan!!! ahhhh!absolute magic!
I'm definitely not disputing the sandwiches here. No doubt about it - simply to die for! I'm reviewing Ike's to give everyone a heads up - if you pay with a credit card, make sure to ask for a receipt!! I went to Ike's last weekend and didn't bother getting my receipt. After I devoured my sandwich, I checked my credit card statement only to find out they charged me a few extra bucks. I know I only ordered two sandwiches and paid less than $20 (that's with tax). Did they add the tip after I signed my receipt? That's really shady.Since I didn't have my receipt, I couldn't dispute the charge. It's only a few bucks, so I didn't make a big deal out of it. But I am definitely asking for a receipt next time to make sure they don't overcharge me again. A few bucks can add up! I don't know if this little "oversight" is an accident or common practice. I really hope what happened was a mistake. I love their sandwiches, but I would have to stop going there if I find out they indeed have shady business practices.
Seriously, I don't understand the cult status of this place. I've been here several times and the sandwiches are always greasy (thanks dirty sauce) and it takes freakin forever for a sandwich! What are they doing back there? 20 minutes for a sandwich, give me a break. It's not that great. And by the time you purchase a SANDWICH and soda, you've spent $10. A SANDWICH for $10.
After visiting Cycle Gear the BF and I decided to treat our taste buds to something new. We always get into it when it comes to WHERE to eat so, when in need, YELPPP! Ike's places was 7 minutes away and boy am I glad that we went there. The staff was very friendly and suggested a sandwich that we could share. I believe it was called "SF Giants". The bread was warm and toasted, it had avocado, cheese, mushrooms and turkey or bacon? Maybe both? And some sort of magical sauce that made it a million times better than little luca!! YES I SAID IT! HAH! But seriously... I'm not much of a sandwich gal, but I would definitely drive the distance from daly city to sf to eat here again!
this is a real conversation. cut and pasted from my IM transcript...coworker: tell me of this sandwichme: it's like heaven on a freshly made buncoworker: because that is a god-damned BOLD claimme: no jokeme: they make the bread when you ORDER your 'wichme: not beforeme: not afterme: at that VERY moment!me: you know the sandwich that makes marge say "homer i'm beginning to think you love that sandwich more than me"me: THIS is that sandwich!coworker: wowme: yeah and i'm not even exaggeratingme: not even a lil bitcoworker: beer would go well with that sandwichme: you know how most 'wiches let you taste the separate ingredients?me: this one merges all the stuff on the 'wich into a gorgeous symphony in your mouthcoworker: Hunh, "Gorgeous symphony in your mouth" was my nickname in high schoolcoworker: (I bet that crossed a line, didn't it?)
Two words. THE BACKSTABBER. I have never in my life experienced the bliss brought to me by the backstabber. I consider myself something of a sandwich afficionado. I could eat four sandwiches a day and be happy as a clam! I could...sandwich...ohhh yeah...dirty sauce... Sorry, I digress. The backstabber is the best sandwich ever invented. It's like this big ol' steamin mess of chicken and artichokes and caesar and cheesy deliciousness. It will get all over your face, and you'll be tempted to eat the napkin you wipe it off with. And they have those caramel apple lollipops that make everyone smile. Seriously. Go. Now.
I've heard about Ike's for years and finally went to see what all of the hype was about. All of the great things that I've heard was true. Their sandwiches are amazing!!! The first sandwich that I tried was the Hot Momma Huda, it was pretty good. It was pretty good, but I prefer the Menage a Trois! The wait is usually out the door, but I've called and ordered over the phone. Regardless the wait is worth it.
i really liked the eli manning. where the hell did it go? can't find it on the menu anymore. besides that, if you're ready for some of the trashiest food you could put between bread, go straight for the super mario. or the super luigi. or the bowser. sinful bliss.
The sandwich was good (not great) and it was super expensive.
As suggested, Name of Girl I'm Dating on dutch roll.Went there on Black Friday, at 4pm. 10-minute line, pleasant line. Nice people, no stress. Awesome sandwich.
It's certainly very tasty, and one could never exhaust the hundreds of thousands of possible sandwich options. The question is, is it worth the wait? Well, unlike San Tung, which is always an hour wait, where you can go get a beer up the street, here you just kinda have to loiter outside the shop while you wait for your sandwich, and then, when it comes, you are basically relegated to eating it on the curb outside the shop since the three tables outside will be invariably taken. All things said, this is not the end of the world, and I am willing to wait for good food. But, having been twice, I have always found myself not wanting to go through the process anymore but that's subjective, because the two sandwiches I had here were damn tasty and the service very friendly for an overworked staff.
Ike, you know I love you! You and your mama, too!My sister and my cousin and I, we ladies know and loooove our sammitches.
Hmmm, I'm a little confused. People are almost referring to this place like it's vegatarians. Meat eaters, don't be scared away...I saw plenty of flesh on the menu.I am in fact a veggie, and thought this place was great. I had the BLT, and Ike makes it just like I do at home...soy bacon, cheese and avacado. This place is small and fills up quick. I walked in to one patron before me and after checking out the extensive menu posted on the wall, turned back around to a crowded room. Ike seemed super sweet. Just a friendly, chatty kind of guy.Plenty of selections...really yummy food, and super friendly service. What more could you ask for in sandwich shop?
My boyfriend and I decided to eat at this place after a Louis Vuitton birthday party bash in SF. What food is great after champagne?...A GREAT SANDWICH! We had seen this eatery after watching "Man vs. Food". Driving around you would miss it at night. Parking is nonexistent but hey, we'll do anything for a great sandwich. We were able to speak to the manager and yes, they have 200 sandwiches! We don't have dutch crunch in SoCal, so I order everything on DC since I moved up there. I ordered the 660 - pastrami and my boyfriend had the #9. OMG! yes it was good. We were able to meet Ike a little later....they are opening more shops. whoo hoo!
Love this place and so does my kid! I would definately go out of my way to get here for a sandwich. AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS AND CREATIVE. The staff is super friendly and helpful. I don't remember what I had, but it was damn good. I think about playing hookie from work in the morning so I can be first in line often.
This is just not my style of sandwich. Kind of an east-coast flavor profile, a little heavy, ingredients are not the focus. They do a good job if that's what you're looking for, but the insanely overwhelming menu and the crazy wait time does make liking this place a little tougher for me.
Vibe is good, menu is tight with the food named after local athletes and stars. The only thing is the price but that's me, I'm Chinese LOL. But Ike is a good eat. Had a Will 'the Thrill' which had Louisiana hot link with some dirty sauce and jack cheese.
Absolutely incredible... Always busy, always a line, always worth it.
It's good but not wait-an-hour-for-a-sandwich good. You must get the dutch crunch roll, and yes - the dirty sauce is pretty damn good. Huge sandwiches, decent prices (for a sandwich), friendly staff...all-in-all, a good sandwich experience.
Absolutely worth the hype. Very attentive, funny friendly staff and a phenomenal vegetarian and vegan selection of sammiches. Long live Ike and complimentary Caramel Apple Pops
I went there for the first time last weekend and their sandwiches was good, very creative in a way and I guess that's why it's attracting a lot of customers. But if you want tradition sandwiches they have those too, but they call them the "unoriginal sandwiches" there, which I thought was kinda funny. lol. Anyways, the most sandwiches here have more than 2-3 kinds of sauce in them, which makes them a lot more flavorful than the conventional "roast beef with mayo on white slice". Bottom line, it's a place worth a try if you like sandwiches. The only thing I kinda didn't like was that there's no where to sit inside the shop, they have a couple small tables and chairs outside, but I'm not a big fan of eating outside with all the cars driving by, but that's just me.
Like everyone else has mention the menage a trois is just amazing, especially with dutch crunch bread. One of the things you gotta eat before you die guys.
o.m.g. heart attack between 2 slices of bread.#2 reason why i'm glad i dont live in the mission, because i would come to ike's way too often. The sammies are great and tasty, but it's just a notch below really greasy, but you can sense it.Located really close to Delores Park so you can just grab it to go and eat in the park or try to get a table outside the shoebox store front. The lines maybe long, but fear not! It goes pretty quickly.totally off topic --- #1 reason why i can't live in the mission: skinny guys in skinny jeans freak me out-- it's not natural :[
Went for the first time and Ike's is pretty darn good! They have countless types of sammiches and random ones you'll find hand written on the walls behind the cash register, behind the hard working guys making the sammiches, and of course, their regular menu. Always a healthy line out the door during lunch time (which is a good sign of its' yumminess!) But they are speedy in getting those sammiches out to you. They also take credit cards which is a big plus in my book! They also don't have any paper menus so you have to either know what to order, cram your way in to check it out, or go on their website to decide. All in all, a VERY yummy place for sammiches. I really liked the Soprano!
To anyone complaining about the idea of a by-appointment sandwich, I highly recommend you get over it; this place is worth a bit of extra effort. My wife found this place on Yelp last week so when we were trying to figure out where to get lunch on Saturday I said we should give it a try. We called around noon and got an appointment for 12:45; I ordered the Super Mario (thanks for the tip Brian) and my wife got the We're Just Friends. We had to wait another 20 minutes or so until they were ready but these were, without a doubt, the most delicious sandwiches I've ever eaten.I work from home most Wednesdays and I think going forward you'll find me eating lunch at Ike's!
If you miss East Coast sandwiches, Ike's Place will fill that little hole in your heart. The menu is huge, the sandwiches are creative, and somehow they're all delicious. In fact, most of the time I just have them decide what I'm eating, and I've never been short of amazed.
My boyfriend and I were visiting San Francisco recently and scavenged SF's Yelp site to aide us in locating the best eats. Ike's Place came up immediately, and even though we had a tough time finding it, it was worth the hunt. Absolutely the best sandwich I've ever had!
Ike's is totally worth the wait even on the coldest of days. I get "The [Name of the Girl You're Dating]" on dutch crunch and my boyfriend gets the "Ex-Boyfriend." Pretty cute.
Wow. That's all I have to say. Wow. Chipper's Fave.My fave.
My friend discovered this place on yelp and just got done eating there for the first time. Great location, nice breezy weather to sit out & eat. Right when I walked in I was amazed with not just the selection, but the cool names they had like "Super Mario" & "Montana to Rice". I got the "Menage a trois". I'm not sure what it means in French (j/k), but it sure tasted pretty good. After taking my first bite I absolutely loved it. It's not bad for a $10 sandwich, but it's the "quality" not the "quantity" that you're there for. I saw Adam from "Man vs. Food" recording an episode outside. You can forget Subway or Quiznos. I wish they had Ike's close by my work. Check it out and don't be afraid just because it's in Castro!!!
My Ike's experience did not disapoint. We went on a Saturday at 12:45 and didn't have the huge line, although we got lucky because it was about 15 people deep when we left. BUT...don't let the line scare you away. They get you in and out and the food comes out amazing! We had a "Milf" and a "Christina" something. Both were unbelievable. Best sandwhich around, compares with Alamo Square Deli, although more creative and a much bigger selection. Ike brought all the sandwiches out which I like and thanks for the Tootsie-Pop. Cleanses the palate. Can't wait to go back.
Hands down the tastiest sandwiches I've ever had. Worth using the iphone app to order in advance unless you like waiting in lines for an hour (still worth it!)
Yeah, I know. I give a lot of 5 star reviews. But it is a rare event that a vegan, a vegetarian, and an omnivore can all get a great sandwich & good service at one place. My buddy's a vegan & enjoyed the "backstabber". I had a "Peg Bundy," and on another occasion, the "smell what Barack is cooking." Both delicious. I always get an exciting sandwich, but I'm sure that a simple one would be just as tasty, considering the nice fixins (banana peppers, yum) & fresh bread. Oh yeah, the" dirty sauce" they throw in there, totally the rage. The wait has never been bad in my book, about 10 minutes after I order my sandwich, I get it. And they are sooo nice, I would wait longer and still be happy. You guys rock.
I was so excited to finally go to Ike's but was sadly disappointed and left feeling really nasty afterwards. First of all, the line was out the door. When we finally made it inside the menu didn't even have everything I saw on their website. I didn't remember the name but as I was describing it to the cashier he didn't know what I was talking about so I just got the Hollywood's SF Cheesesteak. I suppose I can see why people like it, but I am personally not a fan. There's just too much going on with the sauce, mayo, and whatever else they put in there. After a few bites stuff is just oozing out of your sandwich. You can't even taste the thinly sliced rib eye that's supposed to be in there. With all their other customers i'm sure they won't miss my business, but just thought I'd give my two cents on this over rated sub.
yummmm. got the say hey with dutch crunch. the dirty sauce was awesome. it had just enough of everything. enough meat and lettuce, and not too much cheese or sauce. i still want to try the doomsday and/or kryptonite though! just gotta go with 2 or 3 other people to split it. they all come with a free bag of chips which you get and pick yourself after you pay.
These sandwiches are Sooo good. The dirty sauce makes it. Ike and his staff just know what goes in a good sandwich, and they are pretty cool. They also have vegan options too. I just wish there wasn't always such a long herd of people waiting outside.
I love this place. Freakishly yummy and crazy friendly staff. Vegan sandwiches are off the hook.My only complaint (and this goes for nearly every other sandwich place in San Francisco) is the price - $8+ for a relatively small sammie never made sense to me.
Good selection, but I think there is too much selection. Most people will end up to be 300lbs by the time they try every sandwich. If Jared from Subway went here it would have the opposite effect. Ikes is great!
One of the best vegetarian sandwiches I've ever had. Normally vegetarian sandwiches kind of suck, but Ike's has it so down. They use all kinds of fake meat alternatives like vegan turkey, fake bacon and more. Every sandwich I've tried there is amazing, they are giant, pretty cheap, the bread is always fresh, the sauce is good, and every sandwich comes with a loli-pop. Call ahead though cause everyone knows how good they are so the wait is long. Also, they have happy hour from 4-7 pm on certain days and you get a free bag of chips and a drink with every sandwich. How awesome is that.
call me a slut, but i like it when a stranger calls me "honey" as i'm ordering my food."i'd like it with everything.""sure, honey."the woman who took my order called me "honey."sigh. melt. swoon.this is also how i felt when i bit into my first paul reubens sandwich. yes, i bit that pee wee herman straight down the center and it oozed some serious slaw, mayo, mustard, lettuce, THE WORKS, out the sides and onto my hands. btw, pee wee was anything but. the pastrami was piled HIGH. i measured pretty much one and half inches of meat at the center, which was sliced to order in the back. i made it through half the sammie (and it was on a toasted and fresh dutch crunch roll; one of the best i've had) and had to sit back and breathe deeply. yes, it took about 20 minutes for Ike's peeps to make the sandwich, but it was made with love, and came with a tootsie roll.this is, hands down, the best sandwich shop in SF.
possibly the best sandwiches in the city, everything I've had here is delicious, can't go wrong no matter what you order.
The place is small but the sandwich was so delicious. I wonder why it has all these reviews!. It deserves each star they got. Well, I ordered my sandwich around 7:30PM Sunday and it was ready in 15 minutes which I believe I was lucky not needing to wait an hour to 2 hours to have it ready in regular busy hours. I ordered Sandwich # 92 (Hot Date for Hire, Thinly Sliced Ribeye Steak, Stuffed Jalapeno Poppers). It comes with Lattes, tomatoes, grilled onions and their secret Dirty Sauce. They added cheese sticks in it too!!! Also bag of chips and a can of soda. The whole total was around $12 which is so good. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a good meal. EXCELLENT FOOD!!
Do NOT wait another minute!! Get up off your backside and go there. ps. the Paul Rubens = Messy goodness!! More please :)
went here with a few girlfriends on a tuesday around 1pm. not quite as crowded as i'd heard it always was. had a really really delicious bbq chicken sandwich (not sure which one exactly). it was SUPER messy but one of a kind, for sure. thought the pricing was pretty reasonable too. can't wait to go back again!
I was recommended here by a co-worker. Freaking great! i love their sandwiches and their dirty sauce. Yummy! i wanna go here again.
this review..is a hesitant one...dunt get us wrong we loooove the place until about two wks ago.bf found HAIR in his sandwich.i didnt find one in mine - i had the vegan meatless mikebf had the matt cainon another note - theyve ran out of vegan cheese for awhile right (for months) and i always say no vegan cheese and this one time the girl said we dont serve that anymore. so i stopped saying 'no vegan cheese'. the last i went guess what my sandwich had? vegan cheese. they need to communicate more within.something went TERRIBLY WRONG at IKEs.bf is hesitant to go back and i dunt blame him
It's tiny and crowded in there, and they have plenty of vegetarian sandwiches. I tried the veggie BLT, but the veggie bacon was a bit of a letdown. Oh well! The tootsie roll pop was a nice touch.
i love ikes place, the sandwhiches are one of a kind! whenever i have the extra money to spend ike's sandwiches are my food of choice! they have so many options, vegan or not. its quick and easy and they really have something for everyones unique taste. i love ikes. i suggest the vegan everett middle school, the vegan tom brady, or the vegan meatless mike!!!!
Ike's has the worlds best sandwiches. People kept raving about this place, so I finally tried it, and holy mama, this place is the spot. I had no clue that sandwiches/food in general can be this goooood!! I secretly do not even want to Yelp it because I do not want to wait in a gigantic line to get my sandwich. When I want some comfort food I used to crave In-N-Out, now it Ikes.
Hands down the best sandwiches in the world!!! What do they put in these suckers that make them taste so good! The line was ridiculous so we decided to be smart and phone ordered to pick it up for dinner. The sandwiches ended up being ready 2 hours later!!! It was wellll worth the wait though! I ordered the "sometimes im a vegetarian" since I thought it suited my description pretty well. IT WAS SOOOOO GOOD!!! The friend ordered the "Name of Girl I'm dating." He claimed it was the best sandwich he's had so far as well! The jalapeno poppers were not good. I would definitely say to stop by this sandwich shop if your in the area! Maybe it would've been faster if we waited in that intimidating line.
This place is tiny and omg amazing. The people who work there are awesomely friendly (I got a high five for spelling my name the same way the girl taking orders did). I got the Napoleon Complex (vegetarian). The raspberry poppyseed French dressing was so awesome, as was the Havarti cheese. We took ours and ate in Dolores Park and watched people with their dogs. Great sandwich experience!
I don't have anything original to say -- great sandwiches, long line.
This place is as trendy as it gets - peeling paint, young employees, handwritten menu. My friend, a native of SF, told us we HAD to go to Ike's because they had the best sandwiches you could find. With that in mind, I was so prepared to tell him how mediocre I thought it was going to be. To my surprise, the sandwich I had was amazing. The bread was toasty, the meat and lettuce were fresh. It really felt like they made it after I had ordered it. A nice touch was that they include napkins in the bags, and a lollipop! The whole sandwich was too much for me so it's a good idea to split one with a friend unless you're deathly hungry.
As good as it gets. Only my second five star EVER given. It really has to be as good as it gets in order to get five stars and that doesn't happen everyday. This place has fantastic food. Seriously freaking wonderful. They have the best customer service. I love that no matter how long the line they take the time to help you and make sure you have the best sandwich ever. Every time I call they take their time to carefully take my order and figure out the best toppings to add to it. This review is making me so darn hungry for an "ex boyfriend".....bacon, avocado, and salami.....could it get any better. Keep up the good work Ike's your food and employees are the very best!
These are the sandwiches against all other are measured. Everything I have had on the menu has been amazing, be it vegan, slightly meaty, or thank god for cured meats meaty. My go to is the Kryptonite because it is essentially two huge sandwiches so when compared with the rest it is a pretty decent deal. As I mentioned it is like two sandwiches but once I eat half I literally can do nothing but think about the other half in my fridge until I finally give in a couple ours later and eat the rest, leaving me fat and happy! Moral of the story is order anything and you will enjoy it, their secret sauce it epic and whenever I consider getting a sandwich somewhere else I ask my self the same question every time...why?
Ike's is the best sandwich in the city! I can definitely not eat a whole one in one sitting but it tastes just as good a few hours later. I also love how they give you a caramel apple pop with your sandwich, such a cute and delicious idea.
I love Ike's sandwiches!!! There's so many different combo to chose from, you can never get bored of Ike's. I always call in my order 1-2 hours ahead of time. That way when I get there, I just pick them up =) I've heard the wait time is crazy. I think the sandwiches are a bit pricy, so I don't have them as much as I would like to. But they do have random coupons for BOGOF. I look forward to them.
Ike's sandwiches are AMAZING. So much so I would liken them more to vacation as an experience instead of a meal. Yes they are messy but are worth the extra napkins it takes to clean yourself up. Although I have tried many (each was fabulous) my favorite is The Desperate House Wife (so creative), its the Hot Mamma Hudda with Bacon. Makes me so hungry just thinking about it! Long Live Ikes!
Try the new Barack obama sandwich - it rocks. I've loved every sandwich Ike's made for me. His staff is fast and friendly, despite the afternoon heat. Call ahead and avoid the wait.
This was my first trip to Ike's and i must say hands down the greatest sandwich I've ever had, it was called Paradise Found and I'm not shittin you this thing tasted like a Hawaiian pizza on a sandwich ( ham, pineapple, provolone, marinara sauce) the flavor combination was incredible. fa sho i will be back to try the other great looking sandwiches.
I love this place the food is fantastic. I especially appreciate the great vegan sandwiches. I would like to see even heathier choices like whole grain bread but all in all the place is tottally rad! Its my favorite sandwich shop in S.F.
I was pretty bummed to find a sandwich with soggy bread after waiting in line for 2 hours. I didn't realize the bread was soggy until after I got into my car. By then, I did not want to walk back to the store to get a replacement. Oh Ike's, I guess we're just not meant to be.
Just went to Ike's new location and had my very first Ike's sandwich which was handed to me by Ike himself! I ordered [Name of Girl I'm Dating] and added bacon. I hate the crunch on dutch crunch bread but since Ike's dutch crunch is supposed to be world famous, I opted to try it. We took our sandwiches over to Dolores Park, parked our butts on the grass, unwrapped our sandwiches and took a bite. My sandwich was just how I imagined it would taste, toasty and flavorful. I have to say, Ike's dutch crunch is really good bread. The halal chicken in the sandwich was on the drier side and the flavor of the pepper jack cheese got a bit lost in my sandwich. Also, I'm surprised when sandwiches, even special ones like Ike's, cost more than $7-8. Although chips are included, with the prices of their sandwiches, Ike's can round out your meal and throw in a drink too. Overall, Ike's Place has must try sandwiches and there's definitely something for everyone. They also throw in caramel apple pops with your sandwiches!
Hands down best sandwich I have ever had in my life! Make sure you call early to order your sandwich. We ordered at 11 50 this morning and we were told that the sandwiches wouldn't be ready until 3 15 this is only because EVERYONE wants one!!! Highly recommend it!!!!
Go to Ike's. Now.
a nice, solid choice for a takeaway lunch. +1 for the halal meats! and another +1 for the grown up soda! the sandwiches are huge and bursting with flavor, is custom made, and the offerings are original and enticing. well worth the wait. i agree with some yelpers in saying that the sauce made it greasy. just ask for none to light next time. though to me, the sauce is good when the sandwich is super warm... yum! the thing is, though, that i hate the wait. and trying to get a table outside to eat is about as fun as trying to find parking near the shopping mall during the holidays. i don't like looming upon a group of people just wanting to eat their meal... i mean, damn-- how rude. and even though it's not their fault, eating next to a tree where some dog has done their #2 is just... un-halal.the fries are just meh-- they didn't really add or take away from my sammie. call me traditional, but i'd rather have wichcraft, specialties, or yellow submarine. though ike's is a great choice overall.
Great sandwiches and customer service. Went with the cashiers recommendation off of the menu: Dutch crunch, turkey, avocado, grilled onions, red pesto, cheddar and the works! A lotta sandwich for $9 plus it includes chips and a caramel apple lollipop. Nice touch. I'll be back.
Not quite sure how they do it. Everything is perfect about this place. Vegetarian anything, amazing staff, excellent sandwiches. Be prepared to wait. Call in order and check website for full menu
Had it once, I'd go back again! I had the "Paradise Found"; ham, pineapple, marinara, and provolone. It was still good after an hour (maybe I was starving?). I also had some fries with their 'dirty sauce', which was incredibly good. The guy that helped me at the register told me about one of their sandwiches on the secret menu. I really like how creative they are with their sandwich names. This place is up there on my sandwich hot spots.
WOW! Great Food, Great service. The menage a trios is AWESOME!
i've never came so hard in my life.and by came, i meant "came to ike's place."i mean. went.mmm, disregard everything, just check out those five stars!
crinkle crinkle crinkle, riiip, gaarghmmmm, chew chew chew chew, gulp, wipe, gaarghmmm, chew chew chew, gulp, arrrghmm, chew chew....(mere seconds pass as entire hoagie inhaled)pant pant pant pant, mmmmmmmmmmzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
This place is wonderful! So wonderful that on the day we needed to fly out of SFO, we checked out of our Union Square hotel, lugged all our baggage on the MUNI, walked all over Castro to find Ike's, and then lugged all our stuff onto the BART. I would do it everyday, just for another bite of one of Ike's sandwiches! Great job ike!
I definately dont want to repeat what everybody says, but its true- hands down this is one of the best sandwich shops in the bay area. Everytime i go in that area i will make sure I grab a sandwich with that special dirty sauce. Dont skip that. There is always a line down the block but its def. worth the wait.
This place is heaven. I went here last weekend for the first time, and had the Meatless Mike (which was damn tasty)... I've been craving it ever since. Now that I know what I'm missing, no other sandwich shop will ever compare.It's worth driving to the city for, but man, I wish there was one in the East Bay. Can we dream it to be true? Someday? Please? :)Extra points for the free after-sandwich lollipop!
Ay yo Subway, I'm really happy for you and I'mma let you finish, but Ike's Place is the GREATEST sandwich place of ALL TIME!... ALL TIME!... *shrugs*
Just had the pizzle sandwich. not as good as the menioge trois or meatless mike. I also just recently had the paul rubenstein and that was pretty damn good. Still give this place 5 stars.
Wanna make the staff at Ike's Place chortle? Order the "sometimes I'm a vegetarian," add bacon. And then laugh with them. Laugh all the way to a satisfied, rubbably-full and happy belly. {BRAAAAAAPP!!}
After seeing it on TV I came here waited 30 minutes and finally received my turkey and avocado. It was really good, but not really worth the wait. My girlfriend had the pastrami which was not the best, but still good. Would come back if there was no line. Overall was pretty good.
Best subs but so far away I had mayooes blt-ca and my wife had the girl your dating at the time we loved our sandwich they were the best the only problem is that they didn't have everything posted on their menu but I konw better now can't wait to go back
although i'm a die-hard dodger's fan, i went against my gut instinct and ordered the Barry Z...i've now learned my gut can shut it when it comes to picking a sammich. Delicious-with-a-capital-D. hot, melty, crunchy goodness. i might even get the Barry B next time (the ultimate betrayal). go here. it's worth it.
I'm not a fan of cabbage, and as much as I love reuben sandwiches, I'm used to saurkraut in my reuben. I'm not afraid to admit that I was wrong! The cabbage slaw on the paul reubens was perfect! it still had a crunch, yet it was over-pickled! Some would dare say that the sandwich doesn't have enough meat, or they're too small. If you want to consume half your body weight in one sitting, don't come here unless you're prepared to buy 2 or 3 just for yourself. Which is fine by me as long as your supporting this incredible establishment!  This place is all about the quality of the food! This is not Claim jumpers, nor fudruckers! When My Friend & I went here, the size was perfect!  I couldn't have asked for a better meal at a better time! Thank you for the on of the best sandwiches I've had my whole life! For you fans of our Awesome SF Giants, There's an employee that looks like Matt Cain!  Also, be sure to check their menu on their website they can't fit all the sandwiches on their physical menu.
This was by far the best sandwich I have ever had. Came across Ike's on yelp while traveling to San Fransisco and I'm SO glad I did. I had the menage a trois on dutch crunch and my boyfriend had the 49er. They were both out of this world. Can you please open an Ike's Place in Chicago?
VEGANS BEWARE:  Two stars is honestly generous -- I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt. The menu is 3/4 senseless cruelty, 1/4 "vegan" (though I have my doubts). Bottled water and high fructose corn syrup dominate the drink selection. Chip rack owned by Frito Lay. Nothing advertised as organic, or local. To-go bags come with wastefully huge load of bleached-white napkins. The rest of the experience:     Girlfriend and I head over there on a this (Sunday) afternoon, an hour before I have to be at work myself. An hour is plenty of time for a sandwich, right? 40 minutes later -- still no friggin' sandwich and we're dizzy with hunger.     Flash back: As we were ordering, we had questions, of course. "Is there honey in the whole wheat bread?" The lady makes no move or offer to check; instead says she doesn't know, but she knows that it's vegan. We chose the sourdough, 'cuz guess what? If you don't know whether there's honey in something that often includes honey, then you can't possibly know whether it's vegan or not! Now how can we trust that anything is what you or your signs say it is, if you don't know yourself what's in it??? Is there casein in your soy cheese? Egg or milk protein in your fake meats? How many hours of your day, or your week, do you spend serving these things, yet are you at all even curious about what's in them, how they're made or where they come from? It's a fruitless nit to pick, but to keep on picking anyway... We were explicit in ordering sandwiches that were vegan, therefore as a vigilant server you'd think the lady might stop us from adding on a deceptively non-vegan product, for our sakes, if she had any idea what was in the stuff she sells. Chips, for example. At the very last second, in the midst of our transaction, I thankfully gave in to my skepticism and checked the fine print on a bag of Miss Vickie's Jalapeno potato chips... Surprise! Whey. Gets ya every time. Is it presumptuous to make guesses as to what response I might've gotten if I'd asked the lady about her chips? "I don't know, but I know it's vegan!" seems pretty likely. I know, I know. It's unreasonable to expect anyone to know anything about the ingredients of any food served or sold in public, with the exception of people with specific instructions, paid fine-dining wages in fine-dining atmospheres, as if it doesn't matter anywhere else. It's a universal complaint that I could put i any review at any point, but since I'm new to Yelp and am writing this one, here it is. In the rare case that your body requires medication, whoever gives it to you will probably know what's in it. In the two or three or four-times times daily your body requires food -- fuggetaboutid.      Girlfriend asked if her "veggie berry" sandwich came with mayo-type stuff -- the lady says three or four times, "yes, it's vegan! Yes, it's vegan! it's vegan!" etc.. Okaaay... that doesn't mean we have to like it. Girlfriend requests sandwich but hold the soy cheese, hold the mayo-type-sauce, and please put mustard on instead. I order the vegan combo.     45 MINUTES LATER, we get our sandwiches. Girlfriend's sandwich is smothered in soy cheese AND mayo-glop AND there's no specially-requested mustard. She's pissed, and grossed out, but at that point we're both completely starving and out of time. Mine's equally drenched in oily "dirty" sauce, and though I didn't mind as much, it made me nauseous in such abundance, and I had to wolf it down in order to get to work on time.     Given the standard appearance of everything else, we knew going into it that we were in for the typical Soy Deli / Ives / Tofurkey-type crap, but everyone raves about the place, and as vegans it's our duty to try it out, and we were already there. As it turns out, we could easily have gone to a corner store, purchased equally crappy junk right off the shelf, gone home and made a half-dozen sandwiches for a fraction of the price and in half the time. I see now that there's a "message from the business" posted here on Yelp that apologizes for the absurdly long waits. A sign in the business itself or a warning from the people at the counter might have saved us some frustration! But, oh -- the sandwiches are toasted. Caloo, Callay. Does that make it worth $8.50?And yet, at the end of the day, as far as we can tell, they do probably have some vegan offerings. So, regardless of quality, that alone earns them the extra star. And they obviously didn't mean to be uninformed or slow. They seem like nice enough people. If it's a delicious, hot vegan sandwich you're looking for, however, I strongly recommend you high-tail it over to Herbivore or Jay's Cheesesteak.
Prior to today's visit, I'd been wanting to try this place forever. Since I was in the area in the late afternoon, I decided to finally check this place out. For two of us, we shared the Menage a Trois and the Nacho Boy. I really liked the sauces in the Menage a Trois, but thought the chicken was a bit dry. I didn't like the sauces in the Nacho Boy as much, but thought the roast beef was great. The sandwiches were good and pretty big, but I'm still not sure if they're worth $11.11 each. Maybe if I was already in the area, but probably not if I had to go out of my way for it.
All the reviews are in. Sandwiches here are RIDICULOUS!!! We ordered five different sandwiches, menage-Obama- etc...(catchy names to their sandwiches) Every single one was just awesome. You will LOVE this place, a little off the beaten track of downtown which makes it a nice ride and definetly worth it. There is not much seating outside so plan on ordering and takng to a park or something and ENJOY!!
Second year traveling to San Francisco and Ike's Place. Ike's has the best sandwich I've had in San Francisco. Now, to be honest I have not eaten in any sandwich places in San Francisco. But it is consistent with what I enjoy and that's a good sandwich. Try the Say hey kid on sourdough with bacon, Dijon mustard's and peppers. This combination is to die for. Also try the Barry B. which my girlfriend loved, also the Tony soprano, and The big eat. Highly recommended.
I came here with a friend for the first time a week or so ago wondering why it had been so highly recommended. I've always thought that a sandwich is a sandwich, and I've eaten them at tons of places, including Jimmy Johns, Potbelly, Cosi, Panera, and a lot of other popular (and even non-popular or not well-known) sandwich places.When we arrived there, there was a very long line. Ike's Place ended up being an order, grab, then go-somewhere-else-to-eat-your-food place. We ordered the "Name of the girl you're dating" and the vegetarian meatball sandwiches (one on dutch crunch, and the other on french roll). Those were quite possibly the best sandwiches I've ever had, and they were definitely well worth the wait. Everything they put in the sandwiches mixed together really well, and they both were amazing. The people who work there seemed happy and fun (and I think Ike himself brought out everyone's food), and I'm pretty much drooling for those sandwiches again as I write this...By the way, you can apparently call ahead to order. Had I known that you could, I would have done so, and I will probably do that next time.
I literally wandered into Ike's Place, starved from a day of fasting on yogurt and beer and ready for some real sustenance. Daunted by the vast selection on the menu (which is surpassed by their online listing), I was kindly recommended the Meatless Mike, which fit my bill for something wholesome and veggie, but still hearty. I was a bit shocked by the price, about $9.00 including tax and tip for the sandwich, at least $3 some more than I'm used to paying. But, I was curious, and had remembered seeing "Ike's Place" on the list of eateries in my 'hood as highly rated... so, what the hell, why not?TOTALLY WORTH IT. Is it really meatless??? Whether it was or wasn't doesn't matter, what matters is that it was oh-so-tasty. I was saddened by the limitations of my stomach, as I could hardly finish and had to leave a quarter of it to waste! This is not a sandwich for the dainty or those who want to appear to be--I threw all custom aside and dove right in, marinara (super yum, a bit sweet but very savory) covered my face and fingers, happily oblivious to the passer-byers (there's only outdoor seating) who stared at the wreckage that once was a Meatless Mike's sub.So... so good. There's so many things I want to try! And, the service??? Excellent as well! Love a place with good people AND good food.
clearly this review is more for me than for them, bc everyone knows they are awesome whereas not enough people know I am awesome (fyi --i am). I will just say the backstabber is great but you will never know how great until challanged to eat it BEFORE airport security  la 30 Rock. Luckily I smuggled it past and let me just say, the guy in 2 B was TOTALLY green jelly.
Ike....if your reading this....just wanted to let you know that i still love you...i just had to move to the east coast for a little while...don't worry i'll be back soon enough for your delicious creations....xoxo
Ok, seriously, I thought, how good can this place be? I mean, turkey is turkey right? Oh my, that was the most delicous turkey sammy I have ever had. I must go back and try some of their other combos. This place is great, a must try!!
One word: Awesome.Best sandwich place EVER!
Phone order? They don't answer the phones.
Ike's is hands down the BEST sandwich in the city and they cater to both meat eaters and vegetarians/vegans alike. The usual long line is definitely worth the wait! All their sandwiches are incredibly delicious and the combination of flavors between the toppings and their "dirty sauce" is spot on! Dutch crunch bread is the cherry on top. Absolutely scrumtrulescent! Do yourself a favor and go now!
Ike's place is FANTASTIC. The Vegan sandwiches are amazing (and I'm not even vegan), but the ROAST BEEF was to die for! Yes, the service is a little bit slow, but it doesnt look like more than 2 people can fit back there and the food was so great that the wait was worth it. Definitely call your food in if you want it to go, though. And make sure to get it "extra dirty"!
The sandwiches were delicious, but the service ridiculously slow. There were 3 people ahead of me in line yesterday (Friday), and we waited over 40 minutes to get our two sandwiches. If you have lots of time to stand around and wonder what they hell they're doing back there, by all means go to Ike's -- the sandwiches were great. Otherwise, wait until Saturdays when they take "appointments" and call in well ahead of time.NOTE: Saturday morning, I just called in to order a sandwich ahead of time. The phone rang 9 times, finally someone answered and said "I need to place you on hold, hold time will be 5-10 minutes, can you wait?"Answer: No. Another great-product-lousey-service establishment drowning in its own success.
Ike's never disappoints. Seriously.I highly recommend the "Sometimes I'm vegetarian" as well as the "Meatless Mike". I don't know which one I like more, but they are both tasty, totally veggie options. One day I got crazy and I ordered the "King Koopa". At least, I think that is what it is called, but I could still be crazy. Basically it consisted of the meatless Mike--aka the veg meatball-sammie crammed full of mozzarella sticks. What the what?!?!! What kind of place offers such a gluttonous treat? It was good. Underline that, emphasize that, real good. However, my tummy and maybe my common sense argued with me the whole time I was eating it. The fact of the matter is, the basic sammies with the Ike's sauce and all of the fresh veggies are so amazing that there really is no need to go full blown over the top. Save it for a day you are feeling wily, or fancy, or out of control. If you live in the 'hood, or even if you don't, call ahead. It helps with the zany line factor.
Ike's is the shit. Their sandwiches are so good!!!! Get your ass over there but avoid the rush if you can (usually from 12-1:30). It's a small place with limited out door seating so I would suggest to get it to go. Do hit this place up though. So amazing.
This is a redundant review. Holy fuck tasty.
Do you have an appointment? WTF? Who needs an appointment at a sandwich shop? My friends and I decided to get some lunch on a Saturday afternoon before we made our oscar winning 3 minute tribute film to Ace of Base and we stopped in at Ike's because my friend said it was good. When we met her at the corner she said it would be 20 minutes. We thought, "no biggie, we'll wait" so we get in line (there's 3 people in front of us and we're a group of 3) and the woman who's first in line picks up her sandwich (she phoned in her order) then the next two people in line ordered there sandwiches and the man behind the counter said they would get them in about 20 minutes. I thought to myself, "damn, they must be ordering some serious sandwiches". Then he looked at the three of us and the lady behind us and said "do you have an appointment?" I looked around to make sure that I wasn't on candid camera or a new Seinfeld episode. I was like appointment, my friend was like "do you mean a reservation" and the man behind the counter said "Yes, do you have one?". Ok, who in the hell needs an appointment to order a frickin' sandwich. All I want is a ham and cheese on dutch crunch with mayo, lettuce and onion, is that really that hard to make. The man behind the counter told us that we would have to wait an hour to get our sandwiches. When we told him that he just told our friend 20 minutes he said that he didn't realize there were four of us. We told him that there were only three of us and he said, "ok it will be 45 minutes". He then told us that they do phone orders before walk ins. I don't know what kind of crazy customer service school he went to but that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. I think you should have someone doing phone orders and someone doing walk in orders. I thought about giving this place another try but after hearing my friend tell me about his second trip there I don't think I will go back. I don't want to ruin his yelp review but he went there at like 2 in the afternoon on a Monday and ordered the sandwich he wanted and the woman behind the counter asked him if he had eaten here before, he said "no" and then she told him that he couldn't order that sandwich. WTF is that all about, she didn't want him to order it, not like it and then not come back. After my experience with him and my friend and his second experience I will not be going back to this place. Seriously, who needs an appointment to get a deli sandwich?If I could give this place zero stars I would.
I tried Ike's for the first time after hearing about it from a friend who lives up the street, formerly from NYC. He said "You've got to try Ike's". I thought it would be decent but how great can a sandwich be? And New Yorkers, they are pretty picky foodwise. Well, I've tried it and it lived up to its hype.I had the Barry Z and the Veggie Jim Rome. Both satisfied. They're pretty big and it's tough not to eat the entire sandwich even if you are getting full. Call in your order and they'll give you the exact time to pick it up. If you don't, you might wait a while. The sandwiches are really tasty, the menu is fantastic, service is friendly, and I'm already planning my next visit.
Best sandwich I've ever eaten. Ever. I ordered the "do you smell what Barack is cooking?" which has thinly sliced ribeye steak and smoked gouda cheese on it... and it was utterly amazing! I had to wait 45 minutes in line but it was SO worth it. The dirty sauce that they slap on there is so good, and they melt it in the bread and it oozes around everything and ooohhh momma mmmm SO good. I literally can't find words to describe it. Everyone in the bay area needs to go to this place at some point, it will make your life complete and you will be able to die happy.
matt cain and leninade makes danny a happy boy.
Oh who gives a crap if it's appointment only on weekends? It's quirky, it's goofy, it's San Francisco, and people are still lined up out the door to buy his damn sandwiches. Ike, rock on with your bad self. And, dude, if that's your mom working at the cash register patiently explaining your vegetable options to me - or, hell, even if it's not your mom - you tell her to rock on with her bad self too. As a non meat (certainly of the "lunch" variety) eater, I have previously been SHUT OUT OF THE SANDWICH KINGDOM, but no more. Today, I had a vegan meatball sub which, in homage to the one, the only Laura B., can only be described as "12 stages of deliciousness." Done, and done.
although the bread was a bit overgreased, i had an orgasm in my mouth.wait, err...yeah. my mouth had an orgasm.chicken breast + pesto + artichoke hearts + dirty sauce + slightly overgreased bread = one sexy sandwhich.the sandwhich-making crew was a treat for the eyes as well.who wants seconds?!yeah, i do.
I only had the chance to try this place one because of a little vaca time out there but the sandwich was pretty amazing. I wasn't too sure what to order and they had a huge selection so it too me sometime. The place is really small so I took the sandwich to go but when I got a chance to eat it was definitely up to the hype this place brings. I really enjoyed the dirty sauce and the bread. The chicken was a little dry but the sauce covered that well. All in all I would definitely recommend this place and I can't wait to get another chance to try another one of their sandwiches.
Rejected by a sandwich! When I ordered my sandwich, the cashier asked if I had an appointment. An appointment? For a sandwich? When I said no, she said it'd be about a half hour wait. What service! If you're that popular and busy, hire additional people. I definitely won't be back to face more rejection.
Best sandwich I've ever had! That special sauce is delicious!!
The first bite I took of the vegan sandwich was good (it was the Grampa vegan steak sandwich), but like last time I ate there, I felt there were too many flavors competing with each other to actually appreciate it for what it was, which is a pretty awesome sandwich that is on the pricey side ($10 for a sandwich is pricey in my book). I will give Ike's a break about the lack of chairs and tables, standing around is kind of confusing with so many people around waiting for their orders though. A nice assortment of Dirty Chips inside, and I tried a new flavor and the bottom of the boxed stacks that was actually quite yummy. I ate half the sandwich and was very full. I guess I'm not really sold on the dirty sauce and I'll ask them to hold it next time. Sandwich was also kinda spicy, why does vegan mean REALLY spicy in this town? That was part of the difficulty in eating a really spicy sandwich with a ton of dirty sauce and melted soy cheese. Not bad, but next time I will go for a meat one (cause I'm not a strict vegan or anything).
This Is the best sandwich I have ever had. I enjoyed (but shared; although I wish I hadn't) the menage a trois w/bacon, and I was impressed. And the staff made my first time a pleasant time (my first time...get it?). They helped me pick out a sandwich and everything. I do agree with the other reviewers that the sandwiches are a bit overpriced, but as long as you're not consuming them on a daily basis (although if i could afford to, i would), they are definitely a delicious treat. I also like that there are so many sandwiches on the menu, that every time I go back, I will get to try something different. I look forward to trying the Kryptonite and 'name of girl i'm dating.'  The wait wasn't that bad when I went, and there was barely a line, although I went on a Monday evening. It is a little disappointing to get there and find out that you can't immediately enjoy your sandwich, because there is absolutely no real seating available. Luckily, I got a good parking spot right around the corner so I could enjoy my sandwich warm. I'm intrigued that there is a secret menu, so I'll definitely be learning more about that. I rave about this place to all of my friends, and make excuses to got to SF, just so I can get one of these sandwiches. So whenever I'm in SF, I will try my best to make it to Ike's Place. You won't find anything this tasty elsewhere.
Don't get me wrong, I love the sandwiches at this place and what more..? The service is usually pretty damn awesome. On the downside, the special sauce must contain insane amounts of sodium because after finishing my sandwich, my mouth was parched. Definitely a great sandwich joint, just don't think it's worth it for the price and the time it takes.
I was slightly hungover after halloween this year and meeting up a friend for lunch. She adamantly insisted that I had to try Ike's, and I was initially not interested because the wait was likely to be over an hour. I had a headache and I wanted food then. But, she insisted that we go, so we drove over and sure enough, there was a line out the door. I got a hold of the menu and started to stress out... the menu was insanely long. With separate vegetarian and vegan lists as well. I decided on the vegetarian eli manning and it was REALLY good. I really need to go back and try the other vegetarian options. And, recently, I found out they have some secret sandwiches that aren't listed on the menu that I'm determined to check out. Needless to say, the sandwich was great and took care of that headache of mine. So I totally recommend it as hangover food!
Definitely a place where you want to look at the menu ahead of time or just ask an employee what to get because there is so much more to the menu that is not posted inside. The sandwich was pretty much everything I expected it to be, the bread was a little hard on the roof of my mouth but everything else was pretty good. You have to wait to find a seat outside, but if you work near be it would be a pretty cool place to eat at regularly because of the wide selection. I especially loved the free candy! I will probably go back and try some different types of sandwiches when I am in the area.
Best hangover cure and preventor
I came with a desire to hate this place. Hype usually brings out the hate in me. The wait had my hate fires kindled nice. But then, you see Ike's big bald smile, and the happy vibe in the little joint, and the sandwiches all sound so good on the menu board. So you order, and wait, And wait And wait. And then, you eat. It's like a sandwich sex party in your mouth hole. Wet messy ingredients hold up, the bread is hot and toasty, the weird combos taste delicious. Call ahead. Avoid the long wait.
I tried the Vegan!!! Combo sandwich on DutchCrunch with jalapenos on the side. Very yummy =P
I called in my order today #24 Say-Hey and #9 Sally (girl your dating) and my #9 instead of chicken breast I got tuna. Are they trying to tell me something? Anyway, I ate it but it wasn't all that. Kind of a bummer after waiting 45 minutes.
These sandwiches are like crack. PURE CRACK GOLD.
i'll say this first and foremost: jalapeno poppers on sandwiches are pretty awesome.the gospel: I think I may have eaten @ this place one too many times (3 times total). the food here grosses me out after I'm done with it and i feel like crap afterwards. the dirty sauce is a bit on the greasy side and it stays with you for hours as you burp it up (mayo with garlic powder I'm guessing) all night long.the sandwiches are tasty, but they're *total* gutbombs. each time I've eaten @ Ike's, I've yet to eat dinner that night. that's worth noting. i don't get the lollipop thing either.
Now this is the best place to grab a sandwich! They have everything you can think of! I got the CowBoy Curtis and really enjoyed it. It's a very popluar place so expect to wait but it's worth it. =)
Ike's Place is amazing. Luckily I live around the corner so I can call my orders in and pick up rather easily, as they do tend to be super busy. I think this is a good thing, though. Every other incarnation at their location has bombed, so naturally I didn't expect much from the "new" shop. Ike's Place really picked up... the spot used to be dead empty... first as a sticker store and an ice cream shop/cafe... now it's crammed with eager sandwich eaters.  My recommendations: I started with the vegan meatball sandwiches (and I eat meat, but I enjoy vegan meatballs, ok?): "Super Wario" (+mozarella sticks), "Meatless Mike", "Not So Sloppy Ike" (+BBQ sauce, I think).   After trying variations of the same thing for quite some time i decided to venture into new territory... I have since had the "Alright Alright Here's Your Stupid Eggplant Sandwich" (delicious breaded eggplant with marinara) and the "Hot Momma Huda" (chicken breast with hot sauce and provolone, I believe). I have yet to find a sandwich that doesn't knock my socks off.   True, the sandwiches can be kinda messy (especially the saucy ones)... but that's part of the fun, I say! All I know is that with that long list of sandwiches I will be busy for the next couple of months.   Any recommendations on what to try next?
Ah, Ike's... so many sandwiches, each and every one of them so meticulously crafted to ensure the delivery of pure ambrosia.
I have been living a lie! It's the Backstabber that's my favorite. With bacon. Naturally. Thanks for a delightful sandwich on Sunday, Ike!
Saw it on TV and had to try it out. You walk into a place the size of a closet and walk out with a killer sandwich. I did have to wait for like 20 mins, however totally worth it. The Barry B is dope, and I gotta give it up for the dirty sauce. Gotta try this one if you are in the area.
Definitely some of the best sandwiches i have ever tasted!!! I tried the Matt Cain, and it was amazing!!! highly recommend stopping here if you're ever in the area!
Aside from having the best sandwiches in the whole world, the people who work here are SO friendly, and seem genuinely happy to be there...it's so refreshing!! I've been going here for a couple of years, and I still am blown away by deliciousness every time I bite into a sandwich. Get the menage a trios...my friends get it on Dutch crunch, but I prefer sourdough because of the contrasting flavors. Oh, and if you see Ike in the store, say hello to him. He seems humbled by his success, and very friendly.
Damn this place makes a stellah sandwich...I recommend the Veggie meatball sandwich or the menage eh trois...breads are baked fresh daily - mmm soft crunch - dutch crunch - dirty sauce....next time..ill venture and get my sandwich extra dirty - with mozzarella sticks....staff here are awesome as well..just be ready for a line and a wait - and sitting on a curb since seating is quite limited.
I guess I must have come on a bad day because the sandwich I had wasn't worthy of a restaurant so highly reviewed. I ordered a 'hella fat bastard' on dutch crunch, but the dutch crunch had no crunch. The 'dirty sauce' is pretty good but I hardly got any of it in my sandwich. The HFB has mozarella sticks in it, but it really doesn't go well with the sandwich at all. To top it off it's $13. Yikes. On the plus side the sandwich is very large. Good enough for 2 meals.
I was pleasantly surprised by Ike's Place, and am glad my neighborhood has a good sandwich shop. I'm not really into gutbusters, but I ate every morsel of my sandwich (called "[name of girl I'm dating]"). Eating here everyday will most likely put you in a food coma, so I might try to find someone to go halfsies on a sandwich next time.
Great sandwiches, great atmosphere, great memories.
Waited 2.5 hours for our sandwiches. I was actually jumping up and down when Ike himself handed them to us. Sooooo worth it, but I recommend calling in.
The sandwich, the service and the atmosphere are iketacular.
Waiting patiently for SFSU's spot to open but haven't been recently b/c getting fat pre-holidays (not good). Adding my Yelp review for 2 for 1 coupon. LOVE the caramel apple lollipops. And be sure to put in a phone order one hour before pick up or else you will be starving in line,.....waiting.
This place is amazing! Love the new location with the not so long lines, much better than it's old location kitty corner away. My only issue is deciding which sandwich to get because there are way too many delicious choices.
Incredible sandwiches, but best eaten warm. if you get one take-out, make sure you eat it soon.
I had to give a shout out to my favorite sandwich place in the entire Bay Area, Ike's Place. The sandwiches are thebomb.com, fresh and made to order. The staff is awesome especially at the Stanford University Campus location. If you haven't had a sandwich from Ike's Place; I suggest you run down and get one. There is a new location in Redwood City on El Camino Real:)
get The CHANGE. hella good. beef, bbq sauce, onion rings, smoked gouda on a fresh baked bread. you might want to call in the order first. there arn't seats there except some garden chairs on the sidewalk. dolores park might be a good destination with a sandwich. i use the hood of my car as a table.
Meatless Mike's. Call ahead so you don't have to wait in line for two hours.
wow i love it. every time i eat here i have to try something new and they are all amazing.
I tried Ike's place yesterday. It is conveniently located close by my MD...so after my doctor appointment I skipped on over. The woman took my order and immediately asked if it was my first time...How did she know? I gave her my order and she immediately suggested that I order different sandwiches. My BF was immediately insulted and thought it was stupid for them to have him change his order...If he wanted turkey, Bacon & avocado...then that is what he was going to order..I on the other hand happily took her suggestion and switched my sandwich to the #17 BBQ Chicken w/ jack cheese. I It takes about fifteen minutes or so for your order to be completed because Ike makes them with such care. I loved my sandwich and my BF thought it was okay even though they forgot his avocado...(which he thinks was on purpose since he didn't order what they wanted him to.)I really like Ike's and I will definitely try them again next time I am in the Castro, but I wouldn't go across the city for a sandwich...maybe I just need to try another sandwich...which I will do soon!~
even though we were tired as f and it was pouring rain we had to fulfill our ikes craving. this time i had the elvis kieth which was amazing. of course fully loaded on dutch crunch. any sandwich with the halal chicken is to die for. deborah got the super luigi which looked damn good. sandwiches were messy as hell but by far the best damn sandwiches on the planet. if you've never been to ike's, call ahead. they're busy as hell, even at 3pm in the afternoon and you can wait up to 40 minutes for your sandwich.
Yum stuff. I had the Forty!?!? which is chicken-fried steak on a bun, with ranch and I added jalapenos. Wife had the Stupid Eggplant Sandwhich. Ordered the sandwhiches 40 minutes in advance, they were ready with a good counterperson when I got there (50 mins later). I was in SF for a meeting and had to drive home to Sunnyvale first, but they held up well even with the hour drive.
After hearing my friend go on and on ad nauseum regarding the sandwiches at Ike's Place, I figured I HAD to go to see what all the fuss was about! As I walked around the corner to the shop, I was greeted by a 8 person deep line out the door! That must say SOMETHING for the deliciousness that awaited me at Ike's.Man am I glad I visisted the website first. For a first timer who wants to see what they are up against, take a peek at the neverending list of various sandwiches this place can whip up.This is a very difficult place for the indecisive--I believe my sandwich I ordered was in the 130's. :) As I have a light obsession with smoked gouda, I decided on the "Change" sandwich, with smoked gouda, sliced steak, bbq sauce on dutch crunch. It was tasty, I'll give it that....but the amount of bbq sauce, dirty sauce, mayo etc was oozing out of the wrapper, making the "Change" sandwich more of a "18 napkin sandwich." And a Gut buster for sure... I consumed my day's calories and then some... :) But it was good...and I look forward to trying my next creation!
GO!!!BEST sandwhich of your life!!!#19: Going home for Thanksgiving ( Turkey and Cranberry ) ADD seracha, on wheat... It'll knock your socks off! BEST SANDWICH I HAVE EVER HAD!CREW is great, really friendly!There is a reason that everyone loves IKE's... IT IS THE BOMB!!!
Praise the lord for dirty sauce. No other hole-in-the-wall sammie shop is worth standing outside in cold weather for 20 mins. Their claim to fame is the Menage a Trois, but I am partial to the Cowboy, perhaps one should also consider stuffing it with onion rings to make it extra healthy. Big thumbs up and all the veggie and vegan options. Top it off with friendly, helpful personnel.
went back 3 times since my first review :o) I made my sister get another sandwich then brought my cousin and friend here when they came to visit sf from LA...they loved it. took a pic with Ike and didnt want to leave the place. hahahh the people who work there are awesome and have such a great energy about them. When i move up to SF i will hopefully be eating here less then I have when i visit ( gotta watch my girlish figure) but will make all of the employees my new and fabulous sf friends :o) the best freakin sandwiches ever
what's Yelp's profanity policy because i'm gonna lose it on Ike's. It delivers the goods with great food and a solid vibe. I rocked the Nacho Boy while my wife went for some vegetarian thing, but we could have closed our eyes and pointed to just about anything on the menu.
I wanted to fall in love with the place and rave a la almost every other review on this place. Although there were some major screw ups on my order I have this place 4 out of 5 stars because of the customer service. It was the best/ most friendly staff that I have encountered in this occasional capital of DoucheBags. Having heeded the warnings on Ike's waits i called myself being smart and calling ahead. I had to use the wedsire for a menu and let me tell you that can be a mistake. Their website is out of date needs to be revamped. Finally after 511.org'ing (yes I made that a verb) my way to the little hole in the wall (and yes it is literally a little hole in the wall) I called into the place and even though they were insanely busy the girl who helped me was wonderfully friendly and offered her expert opinion without making me feel rushed or intimidated. She told me my order would be ready in 45 minutes and we hung up. My 45 minute wait quickly turned into an hour and fifteen minute wait; which was not the restaurant's fault. It was packed wall to wall. (which unfortunately made me a little sour after forking over $16.31 for a Hollywood Cheesesteak (with avocado and bacon added) and an order of onion rings. Cheap.. I think not. ) Like a good restaurant employee I waved off their worries and waited. Finally an hour and 15 minutes after I placed my order I received my food.. and that's where the primary problem was found. Like a child on christmas I tore into my onion rings and let me tell you... disappointment. Not only did my onion rings have the audacity to be cold but they were stale.. and burnt! And not just a little charged; I'm talking entire black onion rings. I tried to eat a few of them but in between the Cajun style cooking and the horrible cheap ranch they use for dipping I had to abandon them after 3 bites. What kind of place seriously serves 6 dollar burnt onion rings. Although the onion ring debacle was enough for me to leave the sandwich was enough to make me stay. All i can say is tender meat heaven! Everything was perfectly flavorful without being too much. That was truly the best cheese steak i've ever had; hands down. So although the store can't seem to fry themselves out of a paper bag they will continue to see my face as long as they serve the Hollywood. As I stated the kind, quick and funny staff totally make up for their horrible waits and even worse onion rings. I'll definitely make sure I'm coming back. DEFINITELY CALL IN YOUR FOOD!!!!So final grade:Cleanliness- ATimeliness- CCustomer Service- ASides- DTaste-ALook: AOverall Grade- B+
Great sandwichs, great people. Do yourself a favor... get the popper toppers.
The sandwiches are good here and there are lots to choose from, but I would certainly say that Ike's needs to improve on service in order to charge the prices they do. My fiance and I went there on a Saturday at 2pm and it took 45 minutes from the time we ordered to the time the sandwiches were ready. There were, maybe, 8 other people that were there, so not a huge crowd. I saw a guy come in to pick up his phone order and was told he had to wait another 15 minutes after waiting 1 hour after his call.Additionally, the size of the sandwich was about 7 inches long which is barely bigger than a subway sandwich and it cost me $9. Like I said, it tasted good but not great since there was enough butter on that sandwich oil up your car.If, it was food alone I would give Ike's 3.5 stars, but I took 1 star off because of the unreasonable wait and another 1/2 star for the price. For a better sandwich experience which will cost you much less where the wait time is 5 min to 15 min, try:- Submarine Center in West Portal ($6)- Saigon Sandwich in Tenderlion ($3)
Be prepared for a long wait(1hr) for a boring sandwich, granted it's healthly. The chicken was so-so, not quite dry and not quite moist. It was a decent size sub but then again, how can you go terribly wrong making a simple sandwich? You can't and if you're looking for a tasty lunch try Curbside Cafe in the Marina or someplace else. I was looking forward to some fries to make up for Ike's sandwich but guess what? They ran out of their famous fries at 1pm on a Saturday. Go figure. Parking was a nightmare, so if you're really dying for a sandwich, walk. Overall, not worth the wait, the parking situation, and the food.
ike's place! first time I cannot wait to eat my sandwich so I ate it while walking on the street, riding on the bus, taking BART. I just want to share it to everybody. The sandwich I mean.
I think I've found the best sandwich in San Francisco! The salmon burger (or Nacho Girl variation) is beyond amazing and everything else is awesome. I am totally blown away by how good the quality of the sandwich is every time I eat one - it's warm and filled with all sorts of fresh, yummy goodness. It's a bit of a wait on the weekends and there's very limited table seating, but well worth it even if it means taking the meal over to Dolores Park. The staff (especially Ike) are super friendly and cool.
I'd give 6 stars if I could. Outstanding service from the owner, who is friendly and stands behind his product with pride and takes a moment to ask you how your day is. We spent about 20 minutes in line and 20 minutes waiting for our order (which is reasonable considering the bread is baked fresh-to-order). The wait is entirely worth it, I will definitely be back!!!
There really must be crack in these sandwiches. Kind of hard to explain, but there is real love in these sandwiches. Try the #9 and the cheese steak. With the dutch crunch roll, and ask for "light" if you don't want extra mayonnaise.
#19 is a turkey sandwich, but the turkey was, at the most, about 10% of the filling, one thin layer of turkey. Looking at this sandwich reminded me of the children's story, "The Emperor's New Clothes" in relation to the five star reviews.
Best sandwich in San Francisco hands down. The dirty sauce is the bomb. Order the Matt Cain when you get a chance. Only downside is there isn't really seating and you sometimes have to wait 20 mins for it. The good thing is you can always order by phone and chill at Dolores Park. Definitely worth the wait.
After Ike sold all his locations to the corporation the sando s are not the same. His once SUPERIOR sandwich is a thing of the past. The QUALITY is not there, the sandos only take about 10 min wait on weekdays. Theres obviously no more LOVE in the sandwiches.
Ike's is pretty good. All their sandwiches pack serious variety. You'll have a hard time deciding what to order once you take a glance at their menu. If your sandwich dreams are to get every single type of meat that they have with every single topping...go ahead and tell them...i'm sure they'll accomodate your wishes. The staff is friendly and the food portions are a good size. I'm wondering where they get their meat from...if they make it themselves, or if it's from another party. If you want a more traditional deli style sandwich, go to Millers...maybe Ike's can make a more traditional sandwich but it doesn't seem like it's their style. Nonetheless, it's a great place to grab a sandwich to eat!
Ike's is simply the best place in SF to get a sandwich. If you're looking for a cheap fix, go to Subway, but if you want quality and quantity (and I mean serious quantity), Ike's is the place. I laugh to myself everytime I read over their menu... The sandwich names are hilarious and some of the combos that the cashiers have suggested to my friend and I were drenched in sweet, sweet dirty sauce--I mean, innuendo.... A Mnage  Trois with the [Name of Girl I'm Dating] and a MILF--tasty!
EHHHHHHHHH. This place was hyped pretty good by a buddy of mine, so I was shooting for the stars when I came here. I paid upwards of 10 bucks for a sandwich, so evidently I expected 10 bucks worth of food. I got 6 bucks worth of food, max.The sandwich itself was good, don't get me wrong...but, bro, 10 bucks? For real? I feel like it would be fair to assume that if I'm paying 10 bucks for a sandwich, I shouldn't have to hit up McDonald's afterwards. Sounds like a fair assumption, no? The service was great, and the staff was incredibly helpful and easygoing. I just sorta didn't really understand the hype. I'd say the sandwich ranks 3rd on my list of sandwiches from a sandwich shop. With that said, I likely won't be coming back here. It's not worth the drive nor the cheddar....for me, at least.
I have been to the mountaintop and it is bountiful with mozzarella sticks and dirty sauce! What is there left to say about Ike's Place? Yes it is AMAZING. Yes it is worth the wait. I had the Hella Fat Bastard and it was everything I had hoped for from Ike's. My bf got the Kryptonite, and although it lived up to the pure novelty enjoyment of it, it is at least 50% lettuce. I do not understand why they do this, because the sandwich is already at an astounding size without all the lettuce filler. It is kind of a shame that you have to take the time to remove what is practically a family sized salad off of it before you take a bite. Additionally, with all of the landlord legal issues happening right now...I do think it is time for Ike to face the music and realize his little sandwich shop has outgrown that tiny shop. Although I enjoyed my sandwich immensely, my enjoyment would have more than doubled if I didn't feel like I was trying to buy a kidney off the black market, and if I actually had a place to sit and enjoy my expensive sandwich. Long live Ike's, but please upgrade your storefront! You're on to bigger and better things...embrace it Ike! Lord knows you make enough money.
So I went to Ike's Place with a friend because another friend recommended the place.Before going, I researched the place's website on Google and read the Yelp reviews :DI was a bit skeptical about the hype when I got there and was a bit annoyed that it was located in a weird location (I walked down the opposite direction away from the shop before realizing I was going the wrong way). Getting there, I was a bit disappointed that the store was quite small and there were no tables to sit on and the menu only consisted of about 13 sandwiches on the blackboard...adding oil to fire at this point...Or so I thought. When I asked, the cashier handed me the whole list of sandwiches they did! My friend ordered the "We're just friends" and I ordered the "Menage a Trois". The cashier was very polite in helping me out as I wasn't sure what to get...he suggested the Dutch Crunch and Dirty Sauce. The wait was about 15 minutes even though we got there around 10:30 am and we were first in line.I was a bit excited now as the good service buried my annoyance earlier. Getting the sandwich, we both bit in...and died a bit on the inside.I saw heaven! And my annoyance was gone! :DThe sandwich shop definitely lived up to its hype. That's all I will say. And the lollys at the bottom of the bag was a cool finishing touch. Pros~Great sandwichVery good servicesHot cashiers (Both the cashier and one of the workers were cute)Cons~A bit pricey (2 sandwiches + 2 drinks came out to about $25)Wait time (believe what everyone else says)I will go there again! ^^

Joy joy joy!Ha ha ha, no be cha can ho Han Solo.Seriously though. Ike's sandwiches are very good. There are at least two attributes that, to me, IMO, make them sandwiches to covet: A, the bread, because the crusts are not so crusty that they shred the upper part of your mouth, but not some milque toast crust either, because there seems to be the ideal amount of bread for the amount of fillings, somehow Ike's hits that perfect balance, and because it's pretty good bread; and B, how they are served heated wrapped tightly in deli paper. I think this allows the ingredients to come together, to meld, to unify, so when you bite into a sandwich, no one particular flavour or texture obviously stands out, but you get everything in unison. I can't say that when I check out Ike's menu that I'm torn between multiple sandwiches, I don't get giddy thinking about which sandwich I'm going to try next, but I've never been disappointed with my choice. As for the wait, annoying, but I always try to call in my order and have a little bundle of joy waiting for me when I arrive. Duddles C. thinks I need to try there tuna fish, maybe next time.But they were out of both the Fipper, and the seafood sampler!And i noticed that all the prices all anagrams:$1.91$2.92$3.93$4.94$5.95$6.96$7.97$8.98I didn't notice any $9.99 sandwiches, and thankfully there were no $109.10, though I imagine it would be the grandaddy of all sandwiches.
This was a solid 4 stars. minus 1 for the following reason- to get told 1 hour and 40 minutes for a sandwich when you are hungry now-kinda ridiculous.  Don't get me wrong, its a decent sandwich, but of the few times i tried to wait the 1/2 hour plus, they messed up my order twice. i bit the bullet as i didnt want to get back in line and wait a bunch more. Personally, there are plenty of really great sandwich places where you can grab a sandwich in under 15 minutes in this city that are really great, and i would probably frequent this place a little more if the whole waiting thing wasnt so ridiculous.
yum, yum, sandwich; yum.meat or veggie, in a bun;sav'ry, tasty: fun!
Coming from NY, I LOVE a good sandwich and Ike's has it down! I called ahead and placed out order and we walked right in past the line...down the block... at noon. My paul rueben was messy but tasty with a little something special coming from that baked in dirty sauce, YUMMY! I also tried a bite of the "say hey" just as messy and delicious as mine. GO IKE"S!
Hands down best sandwiches I've ever had. So creative. Everything I've tried has been excellent. Being able to put mozzarella sticks/ jalapeno poppers in your sandwich is genius. Try going when it's not busy.. late lunch is your best bet.
Ok, I bought into the hype and had to try it out for myself. I actually haven't heard of this place until after seeing Man vs. Food (good publicity if you ask me) and I had to try it out for myself. What can I say? All these Yelpers can't be all wrong.I looked up the menu online and already had my mind set on Pride of the Castro. I've been craving turkey + ham for the longest time, even though Thanksgiving just passed by not long ago.My boyfriend and I set out, found a parking spot a couple blocks away and waited in line. I gotta say, 30 minutes in line is a bit ridiculous but I had to try it and there's no way in hell I'm going to make my way here and NOT have it because of the line (which I was expecting anyway even though it was 3 in the afternoon on a Saturday). Now if you didn't look up what you wanted online beforehand, it's ok, you have time to burn and they have menus for you to look at while waiting.30 minutes past and we make our orders. I got the Pride of the Castro with added avocado, minus the pickles. My boyfriend got Phil'er Up's KC BBQ with added avocado. No, we don't have some weirdo pact that we must have avocado in our sandwiches (although now that I think about it....). We both got it with the Dutch Crunch and I highly recommend it. We threw in a side of jalapeno poppers to boot. We tried to get a side of onion rings and were told that the mozzarella sticks and jalapeno poppers were the only two sides that they offer. Not that I didn't believe her but I have seen pictures of fries. Meh, whatever, it wasn't as if a side of fries or onion rings were in the menu anyway so I couldn't wave it in her face.It took about 10 minutes or so for our orders to be ready. Our names were called and we make a mad dash back the the car. Yes, there are tables outside but it is limited seating so we just decided to pig out in the car too ashamed to let anyone else see.I take a bite and I'm not sure if it was the only thing I've eaten the entire day but OMFG, it was damn good. I have no complaints whatsoever although the avocado that I added to the sandwich was in fact guacamole rather than slices of avocado. Not that I mind, but they should consider calling it guacamole rather than avocado. My boyfriend also had no complaints and although he was having second thoughts about coming here because of the line, he thought it was totally worth it.The jalapeno poppers were stuff with cream cheese and came with our choice of dipping. We went with ranch (who doesn't?) and it was ok, nothing spectacular, but it's fried, so who can complain anyway?I didn't finish my half of the sandwich and ended up bringing it home and lo and behold, the sandwich holds up to refrigeration AND the microwave. It's not nearly as good as a freshly made one (what is?) but was still pretty damn good. I definitely see myself coming back here again and I would highly recommend it to anyone else.
DAMN. best sandwich shop in townthe wait can be long at times but well worth it. it can get a little stuffy inside the shop since its a really small place. parking is relatively easy; the furthest i parked was 1 block away. they also have wifi so you have something to do while you waitfavorite sandwich: super mario (meatball + mozzarella sticks)their fries are really good too. but they require a slightly longer wait.ive also tried the super luigi(meatball+jalapeno poppers), say hey(pastrami+bacon), going home for thnksgiving(turkey cranberry) and they are all deliciousi recommend calling in to order if it's around 1-3 and save yourself the trouble of sitting/standing outside waiting for half an hour for a sandwich
I have yet to indulge in any of Ike's crazy creations, but any place that has a sando named "Fat Bastard" and another one named "Hella Fat Bastard" is worth all the stars in the world! Love it!
Cool little sandwich place. Sandwich was GOOD and prep time was FAST. I ordered the Seafood Melt. Outside seating only, but my friend and I were able to get a table without any problems. Description says no waiting services, but they were so nice. They brought us our sandwiches and when I tried to get up to meet him half way, he insisted he would bring them to us. Then later offered to wrap the second half of our sandwiches so we could take it to go! Nice selection of soda/drinks, not the usual Coca Cola, Mugs, etc, routine.
You have to be willing to wait for 40 minutes from order time to sandwich time but man, is it worth the wait! They're working on getting a couple of chairs outside but its teeny tiny and people are lined up as soon as it opens. I recommend the Pizzle sammy I think its called... but if you're a brave soul, try the Kryptonite. I won't even say what's in it but you won't be sorry. An added bonus, Ike is a really nice guy so support his business!!!
Damn good sandwiches!My "Sexy Boy" was definitely good, with a small but delicous portion of sliced steak, fried mozzarella sticks, and all the fixings. But, my friend's "Sometimes I'm Vegetarian" was outstanding. It had artichoke hearts, mushrooms, pesto, melted cheese, etc. I'd be down to try their chicken, but there are definitely better places to go for a steak sandwich. Therefore, I would say go with some veggie sandwich and some creative sauces. BOMB
mmmmmmmmm....meatball....vegan meatballawesome sandwich....cured my gingivitus and enhanced that special part of my body!
the moment you enter this place there is no turning back, for you already got yourself into some serious dilemma on what to munch. so just be ready to get down and dirty to grind on ike's alluring, darling, captivating immense selections of delectable sandwiches!!!the sandwiches here are ginormous, overflowing of decadent fillings of your selected meat AND just like other deli shoppe, ike has a gorgeous "dirty" secret....he uses a fab condiment, known as the "DIRTY SAUCE."making the sandwiches himself, ike treated you like you are in a restaurant. ike explained to us about his sandwiches and recommended what was the "IT" grinder at the moment.i asked for the "WE'RE JUST FRIENDS" which has chicken breast with zesty orange glazed, avocado & pepperjack cheese and "[NAME OF GIRL I"M DATING]" which has chicken breast, honey mustard & pepperjack cheese sammies. both were wonderfully given a good spread of the dirty sauce. we both wanted a whole wheat roll and it was the biggest & fattest bread roll i have ever eaten in my sandwich eating life! by the way, they toast their breads also.a basket of their tasty F/F were also ordered. it is low fat and nicely sesoned.the juices of the dirty sauce & honey mustard were dripping intensely between our fingers and we didn't mind to be messy for awhile, for the sammies were just delectably excellent.after that delicious affair with ike's sammies, i was ready to wash my hands and suck on those lollipops that was given to us!ike will be adding more sandwiches on his already huge selection of a menu board and be expected to see every wall of his place to be filled with more sexy bites. i *heart* ike's sammies, as he loves his vegans!
Great sandwiches, very filling. Pricey and slow to make the sandwich, but worth the wait.. def yummy.
I feel compelled to add my voice to the greek chorus/worship. Strange yet true fact about me: I used to hate sandwiches, until Ike's. Some sort of holdover from my youth involving the neurotic separation of food groups. But, oh, Ike. You've gone and done it. And you're only a block away from me. And now I'm up to furtive bi-weekly trips. The cute boys never make fun of my predictable sandwich-ordering (#9), and I just sort of end up wanting to hang out in there, but for the lack of, you know, chairs. And yay, lollipops.
With nearly 2000 reviews, Ike's doesn't really need another. So I'm not here to review. I'm here to brag. I had an Ike's sandwich, and it was glorious.
Incredible Sandwich, Top Notch, Love going back over and over!
When it comes to being creative and original, this place takes the loot. I can't believe how amazingly good these sandwiches are. The choices are almost endless, it would take you months just to try everything on the menu, and for all you SF vegetarians out there, stop in and have a looksy. There are tons of special vegetarian options. One more thing that can't go unnoticed is that every single sandwich is made with such love. This isn't some quickly made BS sandwich made in an assembly line, no, every pickle, pepper and onion is precisely placed to create a perfect sandwich,    Hell, I even met Ike himself (the obvious owner). A really nice guy who genuinely cares about your satisfaction.  There is only one small negative aspect to Ike's Place, and that is the chip and soda selection. Really, all I go there for is the sandwiches, but it's nice to have the chips and soda you want to go with such an amazing sandwich. I recommend that everyone tries the Super Luigi"
My boys kept pestering me to go here, so on a rainy Saturday morning after dropping my GF at the airport I buckled. Found a spot two blocks away to park. It was cold and wet out, another beautiful SF summer day. You order outside, there is no sitting area inside. Cashier was very helpful and friendly. Ike noticed my shivering wet kids and told us to wait inside in the corner but the place was buzzing so we felt in the way no matter where we stood. The phone was going non-stop while we were there. Got our sandwiches and went back to the car to eat. I don't know how they do it but we all five agreed that these were the best we had to date. Kids wanted to go back for another one but I vetoed that. Great food!
Gluten Free Bread!!G Free G Free G Free!!If you have Celiac Disase this is a must stop while in San Francisco!Yes, the line is long and the wait even longer, but if you are Celiac is definitely worth it!! They're G Free bread is sliced sandwich bread.It's mostly a to go place. There's very limited seating, all outdoors. We ended up eating in our car 'cause it was raining. Finally a place were both of us (hubby and me) can REALLY enjoy our foods.Thanks Ike for thinking of us G Free people!!!Thanks Ike for
very very tasty, also....very very expensive and wayyyyyy too long of a wait. $32 bucks for 3 sandwiches is inexcusable, and a 35+ minute wait at 11 am? effing LAME.
Thank you Yelpers.The Meatless Mike is truly the perfect sub. I want one everyday. Maybe two.
get the "name of girl i'm dating" on dutch crunch, and walk on over to dolores park for a nice picnic. your date will be impressed.
Ikes was the best sando I've had in long time. It reminded of one of those great sandwiches from Mr Pickles (Daly City) but with a huuuuge menu. I mean you are looking at about 100 to pick from. It was my first time there when I went on Wednesday which happened to be Veterans day and everyone had the day off the line was like a Disney ride. About 60 people deep and a hour later I finally got to order. But it was all worth it! People were chill that worked there, and the wait in line. TIP of the day call in your order, I wish I did. Enjoy.
I've never had a vegetarian sandwich that was as good as what I had at Ike's. It's restaurants like this that make me wish I was living in the city.
Simply Amazing! The sandwiches are so delicious, and the people behind the register are always so pleasant. My go to is always #108, but all of the sandwiches I've tried are great, never disappointed.
The Super Mario is an enormous meatball sandwich with marinara sauce, pepper jack cheese and MOZZARELLA STICKS. 'Nuff said.
Overrated. Sandwich barely had any meat and was drenched in a weird tasting sauce. Not worth the money or time, but at least now I know it's all hype.
i'll admit that i rolled my eyes when my friend called to make a saturday reservation at this little sandwich place. it was just one more in my series of skeptical reactions every time another convert gushed about the awesomeness of ike's. evangelism gets irritating after a while, especially when it's in praise of some random phenomenon i've yet to try. i finally popped my ike's cherry on saturday and i'm still rolling my eyes, but it's due to the mindblowing foodgasm i had. holy hell. believe the hype!
u dont even need to read the reviews to know this place is a crowd pleaser. i will wait in line in the rain for the "name of the girl i use to date." thank you ike for your beautiful sandwich creations sent from above. first time i tried this place i went again the next day. can u say obsessed? here are some delectable ones to order:+the name of the girl i use to date (halal chicken)+ menage a trois (kinda loaded with BBQ sauce when i had it)why don't you treat yourself and bike over to Ike's place buy one of their DELICIOUS, humongous sandwiches. then bike over to alamo square park, set a blanket down, and have yourself a little picnic. i think i might do that right about now... lol
Do believe the hype. Down one star only because it's so small, it can't handle more than a few orders at a time. We waited for a while. Patience may be a virtue, but I ain't got it. Luckily, it was gorgeous today. Ike is a personable, responsive guy. Ooh, warm sandwich slathered with dirty sauce... This place is destined to prosper.
yay sandwiches! I love sandwiches and I was so excited to try Ike's with two of my friends. We decided to go before a free day at SF Moma. I ordered the " Say Hey!" (pastrami, swiss, and bacon) on Dutch Crunch with Dirty Sauce, pickles, and onions. (Apparently this is the way Ike likes it too!) It was yuuuuuuuumy!  They toasted the bread and everything was warm and so good! This is my favorite pastrami so far in the bay area! My friends ordered the seafood sandwich and "The Name of the Girl I'm Dating" and they loved their sandwiches too! The staff is so great and Ike was there to make sure we had everything we needed. I really love these small family run places because you can really feel the love they put into their businesses! Yay Ike's! I am definitely going back to try the rest of the 100 sandwiches!
OMFG, what a handsome burger
Believe the hype. Ike gives good sandwich.
My husband and I traveled all the way from LA to taste these yummy creations. When we arrived there was a line fullOf happy people Waiting to get their hands on a sandwich! There was this super happy guy outside taking orders and keeping the crowd entertained as people waited... My hubby had a Sean Micheals... And I had a Jon El-Tb... We got our food quickly and headed back to the car to enjoy the food we drove 400 miles for! Omg! The food was GREAT! Each bite was better than the next... The dirty sauce was so jammin... And tasty! We would have gone back for seconds but we weref-in stuffed! My hubby loved the soft bread and I enjoyed that it wasn't heavy or greasy...( I really hate that)Overall it was worth the trip! Our only complaint, there are only 2 places to sit down and eat. So if ur looking to eat there bring a lawn chair or be prepared to sit on the curb.... Or in ur car. Thanks u to man vs foods Adam for finding this treasure... Thanks to the lil guy who took our order. Thanks to the people who made our sanwiches... And last but not least thanks to the skinny guy who brought our food out to us w/ a smile. The next time we're in san Fran or passing through we will visit again! Yippie for Ike's Place!
Ike's place has the greatest sandwiches I have ever eaten. I recommend going here just be prepared to wait.
Ike's is the type of place you have to try at least once because there are so many reviews about it. Their sandwiches are really unique-The menage e trois sandwich is their best sandwich. They put a ton of sauces on the sandwiches so they are full of flavor. 100's of crazy sandwich selections.It takes 30 minutes - 1 hour to get one.. which why I don't have the urge to go back. What I didn't like about the sandwich is how the sauces over powered the flavor of the meat..The atmosphere is what really turns me off to this place. There is not many places to sit and the street is not very appealing . The inside is small so you can't site inside. So you're waiting for a sandwich for 40 minutes to eat where? In your car? or to a park, by that time it'll be cold.
I finally went to check this place out after reading about it for weeks. I was trying hard not to have any expectations, but one- a long line. I was thinking I might actually need a reservation! I got there late Sunday afternoon, and actually scored a table out front (albeit a little breezy, but whatevs, right?). I couldn't make up my mind, but went with a #8. Damn. This wasn't any ordinary sandwich. Piles of meat, cheese and other stuff, plus the Dirty Sauce tied it all together, and made every bite as savory as the next. This place is my new favorite guilty pleasure.
Spectacular sandwiches. If Ike opened another shop in the financial district I would be there every day for lunch. Best sandwich place I have ever been to. Highly recommended. I can't wait to try the Doomsday next time I go!
Ike's has the best sandwiches in the city - for carnivores, vegetarians and vegans. The staff is friendly and helpful. The food is amazing. I do wish they had a few more people on staff to answer phones and maybe a few more lines because it's hard to get them on the phone to pre-order your sandwich. If you can't pre-order, be prepared to wait in a long line, but it is so worth it!
What kind one say about Ike's that hasn't already been said? Some of the best and big sandwiches around, and at a good price. If you haven't gone yet, treat yourself today. You'll thank me later.
Awesome sandwiches!
Small crowded place. Takes 20-30 minutes to get a freakin sandwich!! That's outrageous. By the time you get your food, you're starving! The sandwiches are ok. I wouldn't say it's the best.
If you commit to a $10-15 sandwich, it better be good. Ikes usually follows through. Love trying something new every time I come here. EXTRA DIRTY SAUCE PLS!
No line (this was a few weeks ago when it was raining and cold) super helpful guy at the counter, explained all the sandwiches to me and made me a super yummy very filling menage a trois. Wish there was someplace to sit and enjoy my lunch but no big deal.
WOW! I discovered this place four days ago and I've eaten there three times since! It's hard to describe what makes Ike's sandwiches taste so great. You kind of just have to try 'em to see for yourself. It's a combination of flavor, texture, portion size (one can easily fill two normal-sized stomachs, even though they're not ridiculously huge) and lollipops. The extensive vegetarian and vegan options are a non-meat eaters dream come true! And the salmon burgers are top notch (a food item I order at whatever place serves them and which I use as a quality standard to judge each shop). Basically, if you can get here, or if you can get someone to get here for you, do it!!! Tell your friends, tell your pets, and tell the aliens in hopes they'll forgo the probe.
When I was eating meat I was like, this is good but no estellas, but now that I'm vegetarian again I can't stop going to Ikes. This weekend I had a not so sloppy Ike and a super warrio. my life is good. so fucking good.
The sandwiches here are so good! Definitely worth the wait. Ike is super friendly and will take the time to chat with you while he's making your sandwich. I am not a vegetarian, but I got the "Meatless Mike" and it tasted way better than any regular meatball sandwich I've had.
I had the something manning sandwich on dutch crunch . It was pretty tasty . I love the names of the sandwiches .. so cute !
I'll admit I tried Ike's after seeing it on Man vs Food, and I assume there were several other people in that long line that were doing the same. The place is awesome and it lived up to all the hype. I have only two small complaints. First, I arrived at Ike's today at 1:20 and it took exactly 1 hour from the time we stepped in line to the time we took our first bite. I know everything is cooked fresh, but an hour is a long time to wait. Thank God we were given our chips (we chose the Funky Fusion),which are fantastic, right after we placed our order or I may have passed out from the heat during the 20 minute wait for our food. Secondly, there are so many different flavors/ingredients involved in Ike's Sandwiches that it all sort of blends together... not that this is a bad thing, but it makes it difficult to decipher specific ingredients. In Ike's defense, it is probably impossible for specific ingredient to stand out because of their amazing "Dirty Sauce." I had the M.I.L.F and it was awesome (it so great to say that and not be called a pig haha). I will definitely be going back to Ike's, but I will be phoning in my order in advance and I recommend you do the same to avoid the long, long lines!
I never expected a sandwich to be so good....
I don't like mayo or mayo-like sauces. So I get pretty frustrated when half the time I order a sandwich without Dirty Sauce from Ike's they put it on anyway. This place would kick ass if they could only get my order right more often, or allways.
I'll quote, "stuff white people like " and say, "white people like expensive sandwiches."The bread was delicious. The dirty sauce was delicious. the veggies were delicious. the hot sauce was delicious. Somehow we still left with two sandwiches and a small bottle of water after paying $25 at lunch. We will eat there again! As I said, white people like an expensive sandwich!
I'm afraid to ask what the "dirty sauce" is.
We came from Atlanta & had to try Ike's after we saw it on Man vs Food. It did not disappoint!!!! We had the Menage A Trois & Paul Reubens...both were amazing. The dirty sauce takes this from a great sandwhich to beyond amazing. The people were really cool as well. The owner was there and chatted it up with us while we waited for our food. They seemed to really care about putting out a great product and offered great customer service. We cant wait to go back and try the rest of the menu
my experience with an ike sandwich was unique. so some dude(ike) was taking this cross country trip on the green tortoise from nyc to sf with me. he talked about his ike's place was good and popular. I had no concept of his place since I am from nyc. meanwhile I have no net to find out about this joint and etc... while on this trip. I m on the trip with him for 14 days. and i finally checked the reviews on yelp during the 12th day. the fb like page. the youtube video of man vs food. I was like holy S*** this looks ill. we get to sf from our trip. I m tired and hungry. I go into the ike's place across the street from his older one on a Sat around 2-3pm and there were a lot of people on line waiting talking about secret menu and etc. Uh oh this place aint no joke. being from nyc I like a place that has a word to mouth type of crowd . Means this place is legit. I was like a deer in headlights at ike's place. They are so busy. There was like no less than 10 in the back kitchen making exotic sandwiches. I had the paul rubben. I was floored. I knew this would suck for me b/c it was so damn good and I would be leaving shortly 4 days later. That's painful. It's like meeting a hot girl but you gotta go. I tried the super mario. pretty good. I tried the jim rome- me likey. Whats fascinating is the dutch crunch bread my fav. his dirty sauce. (pause). These things are like crack. I also like the variety of juices they carry there. the pops are unique. and i tried one tea that has a unique combo but cant recall which one. shirts are pretty dope. Golden state warriors shirt is one of my fav. after trying it I wanted to know if any of my friends have. my hs buddy from nyc has tried it. wow i didnt know this place was that popular. home girl from southern cal also knew about it. my goodness people in so cal knows? so I knew this place is the real deal. now all it needs to do is open 1 in nyc and i'd be a happy camper.
Ike's, what can you say. Delicious. Great sando's fresh ingredients, looking forward to making an excuse to go again soon. I can believe the line can be bad. It wasn't to bad when we went. I got the Eli Manning, my wife got the MILF. Great sandwich names, check online menu first, as there is not room for them all in the small space the place is located in. But don't let the size be your guide. This place rocks.
There are not many places in San Francisco to get a GOOD vegan sandwich, let alone an AMAZING one. Ike's makes hands down the best fucking sandwich I have ever tasted.
I don't know why, but I wasn't too thrilled about this place. I first came here around the time it first opened and my sandwich was sloppy as f***k and covered in that "dirty" sauce. I think that "dirty" sauce is aioli right?Anyway, I felt like I was eating "dirty" sauce with a sandwich and not the other way around. My bf wasn't too crazy about his sandwich either. Maybe we came on a bad day or maybe it's because we've both have had the best NYC hero sandwichs?
Oh my god. I got the SexyBoy and the Damn Straight. The bag was SO heavy I had to weigh the sandwiches when I got home. SexyBoy: 1 pound, 2 ounces. Damn Straight: 1 pound 6 ounces. These sandwiches are ridiculously good. Good thing parking is a royal pain the butt, otherwise I would eat here way too much. These are the best sandwiches that you can buy (until I start playing the lottery so I can win and open up my own restaurant!).
The wait is long, but it was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.
There's almost no point in adding another great review, since, at this time, 87% of the reviews for Ike's Place are 5-star reviews, and the remaining 13% are 4-star reviews. But I'm going to do it anyway because I can't contain myself any longer! I must let the world know that Ike's sandwiches are amazing! I seriously crave them every day. Vegetarian and vegan options are plentiful and--get this--you can order a vegan meatball sub with delicious melted vegan cheese! Allow me to repeat: you can order a vegan meatball sub with delicious melted vegan cheese. Messy, gooey deliciousness, in case you were wondering.  Many places that don't exclusively cater to vegans tend to haphazardly tack on veggie menu items--and they often don't taste very good (bland tofu chunks come to mind). Ike's Place diverges from this unfortunate practice with its excellent vegan options; they know what the vegans like. The only thing that could possibly improve the already lofty position of Ike's Place in my mind would be a vegan Reuben sandwich.Update: I am adding an imaginary sixth star to my review because Ike contacted me about adding a vegan Reuben to the menu!
ok yes! the wait is forever long and not convenient, -1 star! HOWEVER!!!!!!! the sandwiches are worth it and the customer service is awesome! so that makes me less mad that i waited 2 hours from start to end. hahahahaha, but still, i would not do ike's on a regular basis, i simply do not have the patience to wait for food. me+hunger is a deadly combo! yesterday was my second time there, a visiting friend from SD and my ike's coupon for buy 1 get 1 free? SOOOOOO THERE! but even with the coupon, our total was $14 for the one sandwich they charged us. yes we each got free bag of chips with our sandwiches, but $14 is still a lot. again, i reiterate...worth it, yes, but i wouldn't do it on a regular basis. what really impressed me tho, was the excellent customer care that each employee exhibited. it was especially cold in SF yesterday, we had been waiting about 30 mins when one of the employees came out and said "since it's so cold out today, we're gonna take your names down so you guys can go chill inside and get warm, when it's your turn to order, we'll call out your name!" (there was also a homeless man outside who was undoubtedly cold AND hungry, the dude asked him if he wanted something to eat and hooked him up with a sandwich DING DING DING TRIPLE BROWNIE POINTS FOR IKE'S!) anyways, so after we were sitting inside for about half an hour warming up our frozen feet, he called out our names to order. he must've noticed how cold we were still since he said "stay there, i'll come to you" and grabs his pen and post-its and sits down next to us to take our order, and told us to pick out our chips but also offered to bring it to us if we wanted. we were seriously too cold to walk and it was so awesome of him to go get our chips for us since he didn't have to. i ordered the ExBf with jalapeno poppers [ever had a mind blowing orgasm? yeah, that's nothing compared to this] and my friend ordered the Phil'em up BBQ something or other, which she very much enjoyed as she devoured it. we did have to wait another half an hour after ordering to get our sammies, but the girl who brought it out to us was super nice and thanked us for our patience and did i already mention? THE SANDWICHES ARE WORTH THE WAIT! altho eating them on the regular could be detrimental to your health, i have heart palpitations just thinking about how many thousands of calories are in half of one sandwich. a girl's gotta watch her figure you know?oh ike's! how i love your sandwiches and your staff! why must everything that tastes so heavenly be so bad for you?
Bomb sandwiches!
I've walked by Ike's a million times and each time I successfully resisted the temptation to torture myself by waiting an hour on a crowded street for an overrated sandwich. But a few days ago, in heavy S.F. drizzle and blustery cold, I took the plunge. I chose that day because I knew no sandwich would be worth that kind of self-immolation. I figured I'd give Ike's the deepest darkest test, that it'd fail miserably, and I'd never have the feeling that I was missing something when I walked right by that crazy joint again. Well, after 10 minutes of shivering in line, I found out the girl behind me was not only a vegan but a fellow Ike virgin. When we finally got up near the front of the line and could read the sandwich board in the window, she started bitching about the fact that there were NO vegetarian sandwiches. I knew I hated this place, now I had another reason. The nice girl behind the cash register was cheery despite being in the same cold, wet weather (they don't even have room in their dinky shop for her to be under roof!). Yet another reason to hate this place. I couldn't understand how she could remain so downright gleeful. She overheard us virgins bitching in the dark and happily enlightened us with a menu book that listed more meat-free sandwich creations than I've ever seen in my life. My fellow Ike virgin started to get it. I started to get it. Overwhelmed by the options, I asked Miss Cheery what her favorite chicken sandwich was. Without hesitation she blurted Menage a Trois. So be it. My new vegan friend and I spent the next 40 minutes waiting and attempting to channel our higher selves - instead of doing what we would have been doing: commiserating about the eternal wait, bitching about the weather, and quietly mocking all the Ike fanatics that swarmed about like flies around s***. Finally, a cheery guy bolted out with a bag and called my name. He confirmed that I was the Menage a Trois guy and handed me the goods. I bid my new friend a dieu and headed home. Fortunately, I didn't just eat it there in the rain because my moans of ecstasy would have exposed me for being the fool I was for having waited so long to try this place. My Ike's virginity exploded with dirty sauce all over my Menage a Trois' cheesy dutch crunch. I've always thought a menage a trois should not be rushed, but this one disappeared as fast as you could say "THANKS IKE!" I licked my fingers knowing the world would never be the same again.
Wow, I'm hooked.Best sandwich I've had in a while! I got the # 9 on the menu btw, which was awesome! My colleague got the pastrami and loved it too!!! Only con is that it is very very busy during lunch hour with a line out the door and only one cashier!!
WOW!!! went two days in a row!!! I had the pizzel both times. DELICIOUS !!
Holy cow! New deli in the neighborhood that is ridiculously good. Huge menu...nice, big, messy sandwiches...I'm hooked!
I came here on a thursday afternoon, around 1:30pm. Luckily, it was not busy at all like the experience of most people, just a few people in line when i got there. The people who work here are really friendly and seem to laugh a lot while they work. It makes waiting in line that much better. I got a turkey with cheese and pesto sandwich ( i don't recall the name of it) but it was very good and tastey. They also come warm and toasted. =O My friend got a meatless meatball sandwich. He claims that it tasted just like meat and didn't believe it was vegetarian. Overall, it's a good spot to fill up on sandwiches. Just hope that you don't stop by during a rush hour.
I'd give them a 3.5 if it were possible, but I'm not going up to a 4. The sandwiches are pretty good. The bread is too soft for my taste, and look / taste like standard store-bought sandwich rolls (which I think is what they are, judging from the bags on the counter), but maybe that's by design. They taste fine when served hot as they are at Ike's, but I would have liked a little bit more crunch. Maybe not like a crusty French baguette, but at least like an Italian sub roll.Their site says "Unlike most sandwich shops where the bread was baked earlier that morning, the bread your sandwich is made on isn't baked until after you order your sandwich. That means every sandwich is freshly baked to order." I don't know if that's true, but it looked to me like there were bags of rolls on top of the counter, and the roll on my sandwich didn't taste "fresh baked", unless by "baked" they mean "toasted". Maybe they get par-baked rolls from a bakery or something?I had a vegan sandwich of some sort with fake meat, all the veggies, and Italian dressing. The dressing also has that from a bottle taste / consistency. Between the bread and the dressing, I think maybe it's a conscious choice to make the sandwiches as white trash as possible, and if that's the case, Ike's is succeeding admirably - as the reviews here indicate, PBR toting hipsters are big fans.I think the sandwich tasted great, and I sure wish they'd open one in LA, but I'd like to see Ike's focus less on how many different sandwiches they can make (especially when some of the variations are so minor), and more on serving higher quality ingredients.Fries are pretty good -- not quite crispy enough, but the flavor is good, and the mushy inside is pleasant.I do appreciate the vegetarian and vegan options, and the staff seems pretty knowledgeable and helpful about them. In contrast to some people's experience, the staff was helpful and took time to suggest something different even though I knew what I wanted when I got to the front of the line.
MMM- Meatball sandwich with the most perfect fries ever. And Ike is a sweetheart. I love the feel of this place and its got plenty of outdoor seating perfect for Sunday lunch. And the sandwich just as excellent when you eat the other half for dinner.
Ike's Place has by far the best vegan sandwhichs in the city. For a long time I was a die hard fan of other sandwhich places around the city, but I am now a changed sandwhich consumer. I have tried about 6 different sandwhichs and they are all great. The service is amazing and they are all very friendly. If you can't eat alot I would suggest you share a sandwhich and get the french fries (which I have yet to try but will next time).The one thing to be aware of is that this place isn't a "cheap" sandwhich shop. About $8 but worth every penny.
Ike's Stanford has great sandwiches. The wait time is enormous during peak hours -- suggest going off-hours.
Great sandwiches, wish we could've had a place to eat them, ended up walking 5 blocks to a park. Took a cab there not knowing there was no tables. Signs everywhere telling you that you can't eat them near the neighbors.....but the food speaks for itself.
LOVE this place....Nice large sammies...tasteful, dripping wet, ooozzzzing flavor...the number 74 is my favorite. Between this place and The Yellow Submarine there is no need to ever visit a Togo's or Subway again!
the sandwich was ok. i ordered a seafood melt because they don't have a tuna sandwich for some reason? it had a lot of flavor, but it was definitely a little short on the seafood! the menu looked interesting though and i'll definitely stop by to try another one.the service was very friendly. but i waited for my sandwich about 45 minutes on a sunny sunday afternoon. and by looking at the crowd waiting outside, it seems like this wait is a normal occurrence. i don't know if any take out food is worth waiting 45 minutes for (ok maybe el farolito, but thank god it only takes 5 minutes there). next time i stop by, i will probably try around 3 in the afternoon on a weekday, to hopefully beat the crowd.
This place is seriously overrated! I just had to try the most buzzed about sandwich EVER and well... I was extremely disappointed. There is nothing more All-American than a sandwich... this sandwich is nothing close. First of all, it's on some weird fried looking and tasting bun. Second, we asked for Mayo and they put some Middle Eastern version of Mayo on it that tasted like curry...yuck. Not cool having "Halal" meats being forced upon me either... religion and sandwiches don't mix. ; PHalal is a strict Muslim dietary requirement for...Muslims, period. There should have been alternatives to that for the rest of us. The sandwich was mostly vegetables and very little meat, which was disappointing. It was over-all just ok. I didn't even finish mine; and as I threw the rest of it in the trash, I looked back at the line in complete amazement that "sheeple" will actually continue to stand in that line to get a weird, not worthy sandwich until one of the "Hipsters" says there's a newer, cooler place to get a sandwich. As for me, I think I'll stick to AG Ferrari, where they've been making perfect All-American sandwiches for, oh, about 50 years.
two messy sandwiches for 27 dollars?? no thank you. overrated
OooooMmmmGgggg! The best I've had. We ordered Nacho Boy and the Matt Cain. We drove fm Fremont just to try Ike's and it was worth the drive then we went to Stanford the next week and were not disappointed. We reccommend this place. it's a destination not a quick drive by unless you live close by because the Stanford one was hard to find-lucky students! So make a day of it and enjoy our beautiful cities of SF and Palo Alto. Ikes When will you come to the East Bay?
I was in the area this morning so i decided to stop by ikes to see what its all about.I got there and they were still getting everything together so they must of just opened which makes me the first customer of the day!! first!! lolSo yea, now to the point, first i would like to say the people who work here are super cool. (friendly,nice,happy, whatever you want to call it)The lady who made my sandwich had a sweet smile and made me feel welcome. So off the bat A+++ for customer service.After i got my sandwich went home and ate half. First impression was good, but i dont know if it will top little luca. It was definitely good so ill be back to try something different next time.
This is the real deal: sandwiches made with passion, soul and just the right amount of grease. Mind-boggling menu. I had the Paul Reuben (corned beef, coleslaw, cheese, etc., on a french roll). The bread was perfectly toasted, and the excess center of the roll was removed to make more room for precious stuffings. Met Ike, who is a local cat and a very nice guy. Call ahead to beat the line.
i'm a big fan of this place now. yesterday the bf and i went to check out ike's for the very first time. the guy in the front was super friendly. he told us to come inside to check out the menu. ike came out and greeted us and handed our sandwich to us. we only ordered one sandwich but he gave us two lollipops. wow what a great experience. the sandwich was finished in a few mins. it was that good.
Good job Ike's guys! Looking forward my next visit.
Best. Sandwich. Ever. Great hole in the wall place with a good vibe and amazing sandwiches. Expect a line and a short wait for your sandwich and no tables to sit at. But, well worth it! I will be back on my next visit to San Francisco.
I had the fizzle on Monday and it was so damn good that I had to have the fizzle on Tuesday. I think on Wednesday I will try the "Super Mario" or the Obama "Change" sandwich. The service is super also!
Don't come to Ike's unless you're ready to commit to a daily habit. Addicting....Ike's sandwiches will freak you out with their deliciousness. Hands down the best sandwich shop in California. I mean that.
Honestly, the sandwiches that I've had here are among the best sandwiches I've ever had. I had a large group of vegan friends in town this weekend, so I took them here and everyone left happy. My only complaint is that the Napoleon complex is so good that it's hard for me to try to order anything new! Add mozzarella sticks to your sandwich, you won't regret it. Love this place!
The line was long, but it was nice out so it wasn't a big deal. I heard so many great things about this place... mozzarella cheese sticks, on the food network man vs food... who knows what crazy sandwich I am going to get!The line was so long, you can't really see the boards with the sandwiches listed inside this tiny deli like place. By time you get to the register, you don't have time to look through the book listing the hundreds of options. Under pressure of so many people cramming up behind me, I ordered the #9 [Name of Girl I'm Dating] Halal Chicken Breast, Honey Mustard, Avocado, Pepper Jack $7.97.Man. I have been waiting 20-30 minutes to get in the door for what i had in my head to be the most amazing concoction ever and I ended up with a chicken sandwich. Crap.  Then I waited another 20-30 minutes for the sandwich to be made. Luckily I nabbed a table outside.  This toasted sandwich, boring maybe to the mozzarella cheese stick sandwich, was an absolutely delicious sandwich! It was not your typical chicken sandwich.  It was the sauce on it...kinda like a chicken salad sandwich.  I would recommend looking at their on line menu to select what you want before going. Pick a back up because they ran out of some ingredients when I was there. Some one did leave to go get more from the store though.  I wish they would put a large print menu on their window on the right side (the one with the boxes). I want to see all those delicious choices before I get to the register.  The staff seemed really happy which kinda rubs off on the customers. They were just doing what they were doing and having a good time doing it... making great sandwiches.
that dirty sauce is amazing. went that on a cool saturday afternoon and there were people lined out the door waiting for their orders. luckily we called in and was able to just pick it up, bypassing the wait.had the menage a trois based on my friend's recommendation. the chicken with sweet bbq on a dutch crunch bread was the best sandwich i have ever had.i want to go back, but not sure if i can resist getting anything other than the perfection of the menage a trois.
We ordered this for our office lunch today. Everyone agreed Ikes has the best sandwich's hands down. Absolutely amazing!
mmmm. i think after all the reviews on this place.. i don't really need to write another one but man was my sammy delish. meatball sammy is delish. i mean it was flavorful and just right. i will definitly be going back for more! Just FYI... if you get anything with alot of sauce on it you should eat it there cuz if you take it to go.. your going to end up with a really soggy but yummy sammy!
I had my first trip to Ike's today. I can't believe that I had not gone before. I ordered the #9 and after my first bite I couldn't stop saying "wow". This is the best sandwich I have ever eaten. I recommend making an appointment to avoid the wait. Thank you, San Francisco, for Ike's!
Ok, so after reading all about Ike's and their vegetarian meatball sandwich here on Yelp, I got all excited about trying a new veg sandwich place or atleast new to me! So, over le weekend with my mister, we made a visit to Ike's and both had the veg meatball sandwich, which he looved, and well, sad to say, it did not wow me at all! I was very disappointed. But not so disappointed that I won't give them another try or atleast another veg sandwich of theirs a try. So, only three stars for now. Sorry, but I'm a hard vegetarian/vegan to please.
Delicious sandwiches. Ordered the hot mamma huda on my visit. Only con was that by the time I got around to eating my sandwich a lot of the sauce had seeped out, which made for a messy but delectable experience. Will definitely return!
i just discovered this place last week. what? a rad sandwich place around the corner from my place??? this could be dangerous on the waist line, but fuggit! i got their famous vegetarian meeatball sandwich and it was awesome. it is a little pricey ($17 for 2 sandwiches and a bag of chips), but i'm willing to pay a little more for a high quality sandwich in my hood - rather than go to subway for a subpar sandwich. i'm looking forward to trying their other sandwiches.UPDATE: 2/24/08 - came here a little after 5:00 PM today. I was oblivious to their "closed" sign. the owner politely told me they were closed - but they would still take my order. i thought that was pretty rad. i orderd the "Vegi-Elvis Kieth" which is vegan turkey, teriyaki, wasabi mayo, and swiss. it was pretty damn good. i can't wait to try other sandwiches on their menu!!
Best sandwich ever. Lots to choose from on the vegetarian menu, I chose the BLT. AMAZING. Fresh everything, and definitely made with love. Besides the sandwiches, the entertainment of Ike and company was hilarious. I will be back soon, and often. And not too terrible of a wait on a monday night!
my oh my these sandwiches are GOOD! I especially enjoyed the veggie BLT - lots of goodies crammed into a toasty warm roll. all the hype is totally deserved. hints - go on off hours (avoid saturday at noon for example) because the long wait for a sando is a little annoying...also, if you are not a garlic fan say no to the 'dirty sauce'. hello fire breath! sandos are just fine w/o it in my opinion.
I don't know what I'd do without Ike's. Great customer service and amazing sandwiches. Love this place.
freaking best sandwich i have ever had in my liiiiiiifeeso freshand so delicioushuge and filling
I just enjoyed a "Pride of Castro," - turkey, ham, and brie on sourdough and it was delightful. I can only imagine how much I would love it after a night out. There was a long line out front but the wait was super short.
I like it dirty ;)! Great sandwiches from this take-out only joint in the Mission! The line is long at 1045 and can imagine what it would be at lunchtime. We had a getaway lunch date and a picnic in the park :). Ordered a pastrami (my basis of comparison for sandwhich places and a reuben. Liked the reuben better - good slaw. They bake their garlic aioli into their bread and have a dirty sauce that gives their sandwiches a zing! Not the best sandwiches imho (le gregorie in berk :)) - i'd prefer an epic taste sensation than a excess blowout of goo (could only eat half a sandwich) :). While the menage a trois is popular, heavy on the sweet (too sweet for me, even though i like honey :)). And be mindful, this is not the place to come if ur watching ur waistline!
This place lived up to the hype!! First off, you can't miss the sign or line outside the door. A huge menu to choose from with tons of meat combos, vegetarian and everything you could imagine. I love the names on the sandwiches too; really creative. I had the "Say Hey" and absolutely devoured it. Meats and bread were really fresh and everything was perfect. The Tootsie Roll at the end is a nice touch. The great thing about Ike's is there are people who will just park their behinds right on the sidewalk and eat their delicious sandwich. That's kind of how I imagine a true sandwich shop to be. Will definitely try again when I get out this way.
I have been to Ike's three times now and just met Ike officially, and I was given a little education about how things are done there. The fries are "air fried," in the oven after the fries are drip dried, and their breads are baked individually to order. I don't care how long it takes (I've never waited more then 10 minutes, but if you go during lunch hour you better get there first), that is a lot of love being put into those sandwiches. There is a pretty simple solution though to the waiting issue, call and order your sandwich ahead of time. Every friend of mine that has been to Ike's loves it and is a regular now. I will write another review after I have had every single sandwich and salad on the menu. Thanks Ike!
I've had a strange relationship with Ike's literally since I first saw the place a few months ago while out for a walk after lunch. This was before there were tables out front and blinded by the sun all I saw was somebody pop in through what was to me a pitch black doorway. By the time my eyes adjusted, someone inside was waving me in which spooked me and I scurried off. But not without looking back and noting the name of the place and that it was a sandwich shop. Armed with and excited by that knowledge I made a note to come to Yelp to find out what the place was all about and it wasn't more than a week or so later that I actually remembered to look. Yay me!I have to say, I'm a skeptic when it comes to seeing an explosion of 4 and 5 star ratings. It's not that I don't know some places are worth the hype but that I know some aren't. How many 4+ star rated Vietnamese places can truly be in the Tenderloin? Anyway, the reviews for Ike's were really strong and definitely made me wonder whether a sandwich place could ever deserve such praise. Making matters worse, the friend who was with me when I first passed by had actual first-experience ravings to pass along. So I made the call and it wasn't more than 45 minutes later (20 to get the sandwich, 15 to walk back to my desk and 10 to get the idea) that I was thoroughly disappointed. That's right, I hated my first sandwich. Starving and overwhelmed by the choices, I had simply locked in on the meat version of what my friend had loved and it ended up not appealing to me at the time. But within that experience, fueled by the fact that the sandwich was huge and came with an incredibly tasty caramel-apple lollipop (the type varies but the joy is always there), a little love was born and Ike's has quickly become a tradition for me.It's not just the sandwiches that make this place so great. Though I'm stuck on the chicken ones right now (Hot Momma Huda, Lizzy's Lips, Backstabber, and [Name of Girl I'm Dating] are the rotation) and my intent ultimately is to eat my way through the entire menu, Ike's is a complete experience for me. It usually starts when, having just finished a big work push and realized I've been sitting still in my desk chair for hours and am stupid hungry, I check the menu and make the call. I love knowing I have 20 minutes to get there because that's enough to put shoes on/go to the bathroom and get in a nice little work-decompression walk. For whatever reason though (stupid hungry likely covers it), and, yes, this is tmi but I said my relationship with Ike's is strange and this is part of it, I almost always forget to close my pants' fly and end up trying to take care of that without looking like a perv as I walk over there. That means I walk in with this kind of laughing at myself smirk which seems better than my standard work glare. Anyway, then there's the highly motivated walk back followed by the long chow session (the sandwich is so big that I've actually done half for lunch and half for dinner or another lunch).I love Ike's. You will too if you want a great sandwich and can plan 20 minutes ahead.
The best sandwich ever! It has been a long time since I've had a sandwich this good and one that actually filled me up. The #23, Meatball with pepper jack and everything else was truly a delight. My friend also got the french fries and those too were awesome, very tasty and we were told healthy for us. Ike is not only cute but so nice, service in general was friendly and makes me want to make this place a regular lunch stop. As far as appointments go, you only need to make them on the weekends. So, if you're craving a sandwich and a cute man to make it, let it be from Ike's Place, it's life changing and amazing!
Ike is up there with the masters of the sandwich craft. As anyone who knows me will attest, I LOVE sandos. When I was first told that there was a new sandwich shop that was so popular that it had to resort to taking reservations on the weekend, I couldn't believe that I didn't already know about it. I have now been three times and can't wait to go again. Unfortunately, my schedule and location in The City don't permit me to get there as often as I would like or else I would probably be there a few times a week. I love the variety, the wacky names, and the obvious love that gets put into every sandwich (and I love that Ike is a true City Player, even if he is originally from the Sunset - Outer Richmond represent!!!). I would much rather wait an hour for a sandwich that was created with love than have an immediate, yet sub-par, sandwich. Too many people think you can just slap some ingredients between two slices of bread and you're good to go. But the truth is, a sandwich made with precision and care provides taste and satisfaction far beyond any ordinary "sandwich."My birthday was a couple weeks ago and I took the day off from work and went to Ike's for my birthday lunch and I honestly can't think of a more perfect way to spend my birthday. Thanks, Ike and company. I wish you much continued success and can't wait to come back for another fine creation.
ike's sandwiches DO get better. silly me, the first time i had the meatless mike without anything extra, just bread, marinara sauce, fake meatballs and pepperoncinis. i was young, naive, not quite sure what i was doing.major advice: get your sandwich with everything on it! it only improves it. it had tomatoes on it andi don't even LIKE raw tomatoes, but i ate them up.my friend always gets the veggie combo (i forget if there is a number or anything) and this time she tried it with avocado and had the exact same revelation. more condiments/vegetables equals an even better sandwich than you thought possible.
Solid sandwiches. Dare I say better than Roxies? My husband would kill me.
Best sandwiches, Ike's a genius, if you haven't been yet, you're missing out. BIG TIME. Order the Backstabber, it the diggity bomb. mmmmmm the Dirty Sauce
I love this place!! I have definitely waited in the long line several times and each time it is worth the wait... whatever it may be.. 30min, 45min, 1hr, +++ New favorite is the Al Bundy... check it out! Thanks to everyone who works here for being soo friendly, happy, and making good sandwiches.
So I've lived in San Francisco for 6 years and have never been to Ikes. A coworker of mine today suggested we have them, I reluctantly agreed after seeing that the sandwich I wanted, the Kryptonite, was going to be 20 bucks. I figured what the heck.. once in six years cant hurt. Well after having the sandwich (which by the way I managed to pile the whole thing in) I will have to get a second job to sustain my new Ikes addiction. A+ food. Excellent, highly recommended.
this place has about four tables (two inside and two outside). usually not enough seating. i think it is kinda ridiculous that you need to make an appointment to get a sandwich. i think it took them 20-30 minutes to make two sandwiches & the side of fries we ordered. i was starving by the time i got my sandwich, which the girl had brought to the wrong people at first, but i didn't care, i was too hungry.i agree with some of the yelpers that ike's place is a little over hyped. yes, they have really really good sandwiches and fries, but for the amount of time i have to wait for it is not worth it. the quality of sandwich is only a little better than other places, so it's worth not having to wait so long.
Best sandwich I've had since being on the west coast!
When I moved to San Francisco I searched google for "best sandwich San Francisco" and Ike's was the first response, with good reason. I've never had a sandwich here that wasn't amazing, from the meatball to the BBQ to the menage a trois (cleaver and enjoyably named as well). The crew is undeniably San Francisco in style and I'm blessed to have Ike's a few blocks from my house.
I had it for lunch and dinner yesterday. Case closed.
If you feel like having the experience of eating a burrito but want the taste of a sandwich, ike's is for you. Lotsa lotsa of everything on everything. Personally I'm not a big fan of gut bombs but once in a while...
Went to Ikes in the Mission for the first time after my friend gave it rave reviews. They have a wide selection of sandwiches of crazy combinations and every one comes with free chips. Word to the wise: split a sandwich...they are huge! Their secret dirty sauce is to die for. The shop itself is trendy looking and full of 'hipsters'. Phone in orders appeared pretty popular and seem like a good option to avoid the long line. Only regret is that I wish there was a patio to sit down and eat your sandwich there.
i KNEW i had to try this place because of all the positive reviews =] i got the Backstabber while my friend got the Elvis Kieth. everything was.....so.....good!ahhhhhh..i love sandwiches.
Got the Menage a Trois on Dutch Crunch.Hands down the best sandwich i've ever had.
Found this place through Yelp while looking for a vegetarian place. Never knew it existed even though I've been to the Mission area a million times. I've probably drove by it a couple of times without realizing it because it's such a small place with 2 tables indoors and a few on the street. Excellent choice of veggie options. I had the Veggie meatball and it was delicious despite being on the heavy greasy side. The seasoned fries were good too although the portions could have been bigger. It's reasonably priced and you get your money's worth. The guy was very nice and helped us make the final decision since they had soooo many choices, which turned out to be great. Glad I found this place and will definitely go back to try some of their other sandwiches.
Thank you Ike for making such amazing vegetarian sandwiches, and for being so close to the park! This place makes me so happy. Unfortunately must subtract 1 star for only having roll-style bread... I do prefer slices. Nonetheless, delicious. Try the Vegan CA BLT on Sourdough, quite memorable.
my most favorite sandwich creators! from the always friendly staff to the interior arrangements of their establishment, if only i lived a bit closer. :[ it's always crowded but i don't mind the wait. as a plus, it's nice to see Ike himself so involved in helping make sure sandwiches make their way to the customers. "sometimes, i'm a vegetarian" is all i've ordered so far but just because i keep forgetting i order the same thing till it's too late. yumm i can't wait for my net visit.
we ordered sandwiches here last month because a coworker was raving about the food. So we ordered off the menu and the hardest part of the whole ordeal was finding a sandwich to order. there are so many choices and none that were just what i wanted. the menu is very confusing but i final just picked one and went with it. My coworker went to pick up the order, so i did not have to suffer through that portion of the meal.......but the sandwiches were decent. I would like to try them again but the ordering process and the time it takes to go get them is just not convenient. If someone offers to go get sandwiches i will tag my order on but other than that at least I can say i tried them..........
Dear Ike,I love you. I work in the Castro and needed a place with affordable food that I can eat on a regular basis. The prospects weren't good. Then a few months ago you opened your shop and I fell in love. Your sandwiches are amazing and creative and tasty and HUGE and affordable and even though I'm still not sure how I feel about the #1, the Curtis more than makes up for it. Also, I'm really not just saying this cause of the giant scoop of sherbet today. Love, The book girl
dirty sauce is awesome and love that they hollow out the bread. i had the menage a trois and it did live up to the hype. the honey is the magic touch to the sandwich. i think bbq sauce was a little overwhelming for my taste but i'm not a huge bbq lover. i tried ike's when it was at it's previous location but just saw their establishment at lime. it's an interesting dichotomy but as long as people get the yummy sandwiches into their bellies, where you're ordering and waiting is not a big deal.
an enthusiastic "eh". maybe i ordered the wrong thing.
Watch out for long waits on a weekend afternoon. This is a hole-in-the-wall with a few chairs and tables outside. Ike's does have tasty big sandwiches (enough for 2 people to split) and reasonable prices but I will not go back there on a weekend afternoon -- unless I call my order in advance. We were meeting friends at Dolores Park on a sunny Sunday afternoon and thought we'd pick up sandwiches on our way there.There was a line as usual so we waited to place our order and paid. Then we waited. And waited. About 30 minutes in fact standing around outside as there are few chairs outside. Turns out they ran out of some ingredients like lettuce and had to send someone off to the store to pick up more. Wish they would have told us there was going to be a delay. Instead we figured it out when the worker drove up and unloaded his car.You can call your order in ahead of time -- which I strongly advise for a busy weekend. They are doing a great business and I wish they would expand into a larger space so they can have more sandwich makers.
i ate this place like 4 or 5 times and it never has disappointed me. : ) i just hate the wait. but that makes the sandwich tastes that MUCH better!
ike's place makes a delicious sandwich, bakes amazing bread, and has a great customer service. another plus is that it's 2 blocks from my apt. an eight dollar veggie meat sandwich that is a perfect 2 meals. perfect. my only problem is that there is almost too much to choose from.call ahead during the lunch rush, as it can take a full 20 min if you order there and wait. i'm happy that they have so much business.
Ike's place is definitely lacking decoration. I notice lke is expanding his business but is SF place looks bad and beat down. I have say the only thing that is good is his lollipop.
I was in San Fran for the first time and I have heard so much about this place so this was a must see on my trip. I have to say, it did not disappoint. If I was in town longer and did not have plans all ready in place, I would have gone here more then once. The way I can describe this place for me was going to see a rock star. I have heard so many good things about this place. When I got there, it was like everyone knew everyone. It was like being at an icon and feeling like wow, I am really here. Parking. Eh. Not a fan. It was hard to find a parking spot. And being new to the city and the area, I know I must've broken a few laws trying to find a spot. And the spot I did find, I am still not totally sure was a legal spot or not. But the car was still there when I got back, so I consider that a plus. It took me a while to order. I had looked online at the menu and thought I had it all down on what I wanted to get beacause I did not want to look like a first time doofus trying to figure out what I want. But when I got there, the menu was different. So I still felt like a doofus standing there looking at the menu with that deer in the headlights look.The woman behind the counter was really nice. I ended up getting the Big Jim or something like that. The place is very small. No indoor seating and with being from out of town and not knowing the area and being a ways away from my hotel, I thought this was going to be an issue. Until an outdoor table opened up. It was a cool but clear (foggy) night so that was ok. I did get some good information when I went back in for get chips about specials they had. I thought that was so amazingly nice of them to mention and if I was able to make i there more often, I would have taken advantage of it.The sandwich was really good. Not my fave, but that was my own dang fault. I know that if I was a local, I would be able to try more items and I know I would be able to pick out a favorite. But for my first go at it, I thought the sandwich was good. So like I said, this place just reminded me of Rock Star. The guy could sell out and go to a bigger place with more seating, but why?! From just the looks of it, he has a great following. Great friends that stop by. Some really great people working for him. Really good sandwiches. I know that if I am able to visit San Fran again, this will again be a place I will visit again. This time, I WON'T be the doofus staring at the menu for 5 min before making my selection.
Ike's is all of 200 feet from the apartment I have lived in for 2.5 years, but I didn't have any idea it was there. A neighbor told me about it and I failed to Yelp it before going, so I was blissfully unaware of the weekend "appointment" policy.My first visit was on Saturday at about 1pm. I ordered the "Tony Soprano" to go, waited about 15 minutes, then walked home and went to town on this Delicious sandwich. I'm a big boy prone to eating big portions and these aren't HUUUUUGE sandwiches. But they are toasted and tasty and big enough to leave me completely satisfied.I waited all of 24 hours before my second visit to Ike's. This time I went around 3:30 on Sunday. I took Ike's recommendation and ordered the Paul Reuben (I feel like that's not exactly right, but it's close), waited about 10 minutes and again walked home to enjoy my sandwich. Fantastic! I'm a big fan of sandwiches with cole slaw on them...I believe this had poppyseed coleslaw with French dressing.Two weekend visits and hardly a wait at all. So one (or more) of the following must be true:1. I am one lucky SOB!2. Ike has listened to his critics and sped up the process a bit.3. There are a bunch of impatient whiners out there who ran home to their computers, tears streaming down their faces, to post a 1-star review because they were asked to wait a moment or two for their sandwiches.Anyway...great sandwiches...friendly service...a huge menu...I'll be back!A SIDE NOTE...is anybody else tired of hearing that there's no place to get a good sandwich, bagel, or slice of pizza West of the Mississippi? You guys can either open up an "authentic" place out here (where I'm sure you will receive countless negative reviews from your fellow East Coast transplants), learn to like something new, or hop the next flight out of town...you won't be missed.
better location now...waiting is getting easier :) 10bucks for the sandv. but it's worth to every penny...u can even share w someone ..my fav. is spiffy tiffy
Ike's Place is super yummy! I had the #19 (Something About Thanksgiving- this isn't really the name but it was full of Thanksgiving food!) and it was full of flavor. The meat was tender and the sandwich was perfectly warmed so it didn't wilt the lettuce, yet melted the cheese just enough.The dirty sauce (a nice garlic aioli) is the icing on the cake and next time I'm there, I'm asking for extra. It reminds me of sandwiches in the E. Coast, where it's a meal as opposed to Subway being a little snack. The service was friendly and if you need the bathroom, they have an itty bitty one behind the cashier. My favorite thing is their thoughtfulness in proving something sweet...when I was there, they included a caramel apple pop- that was nice!
The food here is really good, and the sandwiches will leave you full for sure...the place is essentially a walk in, pick up kind of place with extremely limited seating outdoors (limited to maybe 3 or 4 tables) but the sandwiches have every meat and veggie in the book and have fun names like "Peg bundy" and "Napolean Complex." Grab a sandwich and some chips, head to Dolores park, and enjoy a great eat in the sun...
I actually would give it a 3.5 it that was possible. About 3,100 reviews with a 4.5 Stars in YELP promised an awesome experience. The place is in a bar that is half open for the sandwich buyers to sit. The line with 15 people took 30 minutes. When we finally arrived to the front of the like the rank smell of old beer was greeting us. Good they took credit cards. after placing the order. another 30 minutes. By the time the food arrives you are so hungry that it tastes good. But I thought that it had too many ingredients and sauces that you do not taste the indivuidual ingredients. My sandwich the 76 (MILF) had Halal Chicken Breast (the chicken was shreded and it had the consistency of pulled pork. It was Good, maybe even very good but it was not worth the wait, and definitely for the accomodation not the $12 dollars i paid for it. Nice young crowd. I would like to check the one in Palo Alto.
I hate people who say: "so and so makes the best (fill in the blank with food)". First off: have you tested ALL of the places who makes that food? are you even sure you have the minimum amount of taste buds required to make a reliable taster? Now after saying this, it would be hypocritical of me to claim to know who makes the best sandwiches. But I will say it:Ike makes the best sandwiches. period. don't make me dare you to try it. you will lose. after all, he manages to make what is for most of us just lunch food, cheap and easy to eat, a great food experience. Yes he does it with sandwiches. Count how many places you know who makes sandwiches. Now try to remember their menu. yeah: one word comes to mind: BORING.Ike's sandwiches are the exact opposit. they will amaze you, make you beg for more, and best of all: satiate you. there are messy and absolutely original which is the best compliment they could get.I will in the future review all the sandwich I tried there. All I can say now is that number 20 is currently a winner, with an unusual combination of ingredients that mix well together.
The eli manning is delicious! fresh avocado and a tasty chicken breast. i'm not a fan of the quarterback, but the sandwich is definitely worth it.
i hadn't been in almost 3 or 4 months. got the meatless meatball sandwich today. exceptional doesn't do it justice, that thing was en pointe!the lady working the register was super cute, and also made a great game time decision on the french roll for the bread. it matched perfectly.Ike seems to be less in the cooking now and more in the over seeing and mingling, which i like as that guy is one personable mofo. Glad to have it back in my repertoire.
pastrami, bacon, fried mozzarella, special sauce (what is it???)... token tomatoes and lettuce... soft roll. done.. then call it hella phat bastard. godamnit its so wrong... and yet so right.
This has to be one of my favorite sandwich places. I order the Nacho Girl; its ingredients are wild salmon, havarti, mushrooms, avocado (yum!), and Ike's Dirty Sauce(some type of garlic aioli). The sandwich is just stunning. The decently sized sandwiches come with a lollipop and bag of chips. There isn't much seating, but I don't really care about that. The cashiers were coolio.
Ike's Place is a great place for sandwiches al fresco.Four of us went to Ike's place and eat delicious sandwiches. Ike's is 5 star on taste, quality, friendliness and service. They got my wife's sandwich wrong - she's an avocado hater and guess what was on her sandwich. Of course they did a re-make. But they felt bad about the error and came by a couple of times sayng: "Can we get you something to make up for the inconvenience?" No, but she was very happy when the new sandwich arrived.I need to be gluten-free, and my version of the Barry Z was absolutely wonderful. The gluten-free bread is on the small side, so Ike's gives you two sandwiches. The amount of food is generous.All four of us are looking forward to being back at Ike's.
never had a bad sandwich here, always delicious. the prices have gone up it seems and are a bit steep for a sandwich, but still worth it. about $10 a pop.
possibly worlds best sandwhiches!need i say more??no... just eat here as often as possiblefor reals!
Wow the Sandwich is great. I got a Barry Z #75 and it was delicious. Call in your order and they will give an estimate so you don't have to wait. big plus for that. will continue to taste all the different choices they have.
Best sandwich in the Bay..I have to say that there tons tons of menu and sauces here...If you like me, Meat lovers to the death, and like spicy, you MUST orders doomsday sandwich. It comes with 2 full sandwiched. So, you have to share with one other homeboy or girl...for the vegan, I am not into it so I have no idea but i heart that the veggie steak is very tasty too.. Very recommended!!!
Definitely a solid five out of five. Since my first visit, my friends and I have come by more often for lunch. My most recent visit, Ike himself came out to personally deliver my meal and thank me for my original review and continued patronage. In addition, I noticed the staff greeting all their regulars by first name. You can't beat service like that. This place is definitely worth going out of your way for. Keep up the great work Ike (and crew), and we'll see you soon for lunch!
I'm a big fan! I heard a lot about Ike's from my friend's husband so I decided to try it. I was surprised at how small the place is, and wondered how they managed to get a 3 hour line on weekends! But my friend and I shared two sandwiches (to maximize our experience) and I was impressed. The sandwiches are creative and the names are even more so. They're also big so bring a ziploc bag if you can remember. Staff is very friendly and I would definitely go back there to nosh my way through all the rest of the sandwiches. Easy to get to from Muni at Church Station. Definitely a must-have!
If I were rating this place on the food alone, I would give it 5 stars. The sandwich comes loaded with just about any topping you could want and there are add ons too. Very yummy!The service was great, very friendly, but the sandwich was almost $10! (Hence the 4 stars)Buuuuut, I would definitely eat here again!
best. sandwich. ever. period.
guess what? ike's still tastes just as great at lime, but there is no line and you can SIT DOWN!!!!!!! INSIDE!!!! can't wait until ike opens up his new shop but until then i'm not complaining.
The sandwich was tasty and full of yummy things. The wait... I wasn't prepared for. I need to go back to try something more daring than the turkey yumminess I had last time.I love sandwiches!
best sandwiches. hella fat bastard and manage a trois pwn
Best sandwich... hands down.
They've found the formula for a yummy sandwich. They're wet and they're salty. You will not get a bland or dry sandwich here. The staff are very friendly, very personable, very young, very stoned...if they get your order right the first time, you're doing well. If you wait less than 20 minutes you're doing well, even if you call ahead.
I am impressed just by the line out the door, and there is a recession. I can't wait to try it
I was reluctant about going to Ike's place for the longest time. I wasn't sure if all the reviews on yelp will live up to the hype when I actually go and try the place out. I read that the lines were extremely long but was worth the wait. All the things I read about this place were correct. I tried "the Name of the girl I'm dating" sandwich, and damn it tasted wonderful. I felt like it was the main highlight to my boring weekend. I will definitely come back when I'm in the mood for a good sandwich!
Great sandwich. Big enough for 2...bring a friend. Small spot, so go on a sunny day, or get it to go.
Went here after a lot of hype, and gotta say it was a pretty damn good sandwich, even for $10. I had the Matt Cain, which has a bunch of meat and their patented Dirty Sauce. You get a bag of chips and some carmel apple lolli-pops to boot, but don't expect to dine in, there aint no where for you to sit.
Not that Ike's needs another 5 star review, but I'm going to pile it on anyway - just like Ike's does with their delicious toppings. This place is like going to your friend's house for some home-made specialty hogies (intimate, comfortable, yummy). Great find for any sandwich lover.
I made my way there on a lazy Saturday afternoon with a buddy after seeing my fellow Yelpers screaming must eat praise to Ike's.A little line awaited us when we arrived at around 2:30 in the afternoon to my surprise foiling my attempt avoid the lunch crowd. Good sandwich and friendly cashier / staff! Needless to say, I will be dropping by again to try another.
Little hole in the wall place, literally not much space in the actual store to stand, but it's the yummy sandwiches that do it. Apparently they have "happy hour" from 4-7 and you get free chips and drink with your sandwich only during the weekdays.They have a great variety of sandwiches, all very messy so remember your napkins! If you can think of a combo not already on the menu, more power to ya, because they have tons even for the veggie/vegan types.And if you don't like the seating outside on the street it's just a few blocks from Dolores park.
Ikes is fantastic....creative sandwich makin' goin on.  Fresh ingredients and great folks working there.
The ambiance is funky! I completely loved it, it has a lounge + dining area. You could either order there or pick up. If you pick up, you can still grab a seat anywhere and eat. The Dirty Chips that they give with any sandwich are really yummy. Definitely , worth trying out.
In all my honesty I have not tasted a better Sandwhich. I got the San Francisco Cheese Steak and oh my was it worth it. The meat was prepared perfectly and the lettuce and tomato weren't splashed on like subway does it. Its actually neatly prepared and worth the wait completely. Sandwhiches range from 8-11$ depending on what your ordering. I would recommend this place to any one who enjoys a savory but casual meal. The employees there are extremely nice. I remember when I paid for mine I forgot to get a drink and she just told me to take one or leave a tip if i felt it was necessary. After the first bite of the sandwhich it was as if the food melted and blended in with my taste buds. The place is a little awkward and difficult to find because it does not match the same address on this page. They're actually located on 16th and Sanchez. I would recommend any one who's taking a vacation or even if you live in San Francisco and haven't had the chance to try these sandwhiches. I guarantee you won't be disappointed I hope to come back soon.
Seriously, it's all about the dirty sauce.Yes, the food is good and fresh and the names of their sandwiches are clever and hip too, but the dirty sauce--that'll make anything taste delicious. And since they put it on most of their sandwiches...you get the idea.Go there. Eat there. Give them enough business to warrant moving into a bigger space.
First time we went (Sun. lunchtime) it was closed and Lime was in full operation. We tried again 5 weeks later (today- Sat. lunchtime) and both Lime and Ike's were in full operation. You order about 4 feet into the front door, pay, grab a bag of chips and wait outside for someone to bring your order out to you. The wait was LONG for a sandwich and the LOUD music from Lime is where we do not want to be close to. After we got our food, we headed home to eat it since there was no "dine-in." Food-excellent; place-sucks. IKE GET OUT OF LIME AS SOON AS YOU CAN!
I saw this place on Man vs. Food so my cousins and I decided to go. Okay, the line was ridiculously long, but there was a menu traveling down the line and with the 4 of us trying to decide what we wanted, it went by quicker than anticipated. The staff was friendly and all of our sandwiches were great.
Wow! Outstanding and well worth the wait!
4.5 stars (.5 for lack of sitting) But, the place is so good, I may just eat sitting on the side walk. The Yelp community is totally correct on this place. Ike's Rocks! The staff is amazing and the sandwiches are creative and extremely good. I don't know if it is a good or bad thing that I don't live closer to this place. Rock on... I will be back to try the many different sando's they have to offer. Great job you guys!
All I can say is GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! We first saw this place on Man vs Food - Food Network. Were in SF on vacation and made the trip to the Castro district just to eat here. Lets start with the staff - they are amazing. Friendly, fun and genuinely happy that you came. More than happy to help with any questions and recommendations.The crowd was upbeat and the minute you walked in, got good vibes. The sandwiches - not even sure of the word - AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING,. We all got different sandwiches but the Ugly Owl...........if I could have taken it home without it getting soggy I would have ordered a weeks worth. Amazing. This place is the bomb! Go! I would make the trip from San Diego to San Fran just to go again!
Ike's Place is the sandwich version of Ben & Jerry's.
All the hype proven true. I walked up on a saturday and it's so busy you need to make appointments now. But my sandwich was so good. Did not need an appointment just had to wait 30 mins. for the sandwich. WELL WORTH IT. I had the cheesesteak. YUMM
Note that there's the dirty sauce that they put on the bread before making your sandwich that made me nauseous all day; it's like an aioli kind of. The people that work here are SO nice and cool.
I met Ike today.  He sure knows how to make a great sandwich.  Nice friendly crowd waiting outside.  I just LOVE how Ike comes out himself and talks with people and hands them their sandwiches.Nothing more can be said that hasn't been said already.  I bought two sandwiches. I got a meatball because I'm always looking for a great meatball sandwich and not many places make em right. Ike does, great melted cheese, great meat and great sauce.  I also got a turkey and bacon sandwich which was simply the best.I had a good time watching the staff go round singing songs. While they were all working their asses off, one would start a song, another would sing the next verse and so on till someone didnt know the words. Ike even walked in from outside, yelled out something and everyone in the place all clapped once at the same time and just went on working like nothing happened.  Awesome.This is now my number one destination every time I go downtown.
BEST sandwiches ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I've brought several friends here, and they all LOVED their sandwiches. These sandwiches are the kind I DREAM about. Just thinking about that Nacho Boy with the dirty sauce makes my mouth water!! Going to the Castro isn't super convenient for me, but I'll make that long drive just for the BEST sandwiches ever!!! And Ike is super friendly. :)
OK, so this is where I got the BEST sandwich I've EVER eaten. Literally perfect. My buddy and I went to the city just to eat here and boy am I happy we did. I got the Lex Luthor and he got the Kryptonite, which already made my day with the Superman references. The sandwiches were HUGE, both of them could easily be 4 meals each but once you start eating them you'll only stop when you can't eat anymore, and trust me that time will come. The Lex Luthor is divided into two halves, Lex and Luthor. Both halves are AMAZING! When I ordered the sandwich, the girl at the register said they were out of chicken fried steak so I told her to surprise me with the replacement item which she did a stellar job in. The sandwich was delicious and extremely large, the combination of all different meats, and sauces still make my mouth water. I was able to eat that sandwich for 3 of my meals and was very satisfied at the end of each sitting. You get chips included on your order too which is a good snack while you wait. Although many of my friends have told me that there is always a line, when my buddy and I went (on a Sunday around 4pm) there was no line at all, we arrived at the shop and ordered right away, within 5-10 min we had the 2 biggest sandwiches they make ready to be devoured. Only thing that they could improve on would be sitting and table since there is a very limited amount of it. I payed $20 for my Lex Luthor and it was worth every penny, simply an amazing sandwich, would recommend to everyone!!
Amaaaazing. I love the Backstabber. And the MILF. There can be a wait but it's always worth it. You can call in advance to order. The staff's super nice even when they're slammed.
After all the reviews, I had to try out this place in my 'hood. The sandwiches are AMAZING. Highly recommended. THe only downside is that the wait can be a while depending on when you go. So, if you are in a hurry, this probably isn't the best choice but if you don't mind a little chaos at the shop and waiting a bit, it really is worth the wait.
I've only been here once; it was unbelievable. I had "The Mario," which is a meatball with fried Mozzarella sticks. Mmmmmmmm.I'm going back. Soon.
DIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTY SAAAAAAAAUUUUUUCE! Man oh man, best vegetarian meat sammiches in the city! And their tuna melt is top shelf too. Ike's also super rad.
This place is fabulous. Excellent veggie and vegan selections . . . PLUS gluten free bread! And it was all delicious. When my boyfriend and I first got to Ike's at 2:30 on a Saturday, the wait was 1 hour and 45 minutes (Calling ahead is a great idea!) - so we took a walk around the Mission, grabbed a snack, and came back just before 5:00 to pick up the sandwiches we had ordered earlier. At that point, there were tables open (this is not often the case). Ike was friendly and happy to talk. You can tell he loves the shop and it shows. This place is a great find for all sandwich lovers. Go to Ike's - especially those of you looking for good veggie and vegan options!
I went to Ike's based on the reviews from Yelp's and it is within a mile from my church, making it easy to walk to. When I got there, I realized I had to be a stealth little falcon to get my seat as this is a perfect hole in the wall shop. I got the number 9 and had the guy taking my order tell me what to get on it. This sandwich was awesome, the dutch crunch was amazing for bread and the dirty sauce gave it that right amount of goodness in the background that makes you crave for more.After looking at the pictures for Ike's, I forgot about the fries! Next time! But for a sandwich and a bottled water to be under $9, that is a steal in San Francisco. In the end, two friends and I all at there for the first time and will definitely make this a must stop place in that vacinity.
Super friendly hole-in-the-wall. Luckily it was a gorgeous day and we could enjoy our sandwiches at one of the half-dozen or so tables outside. Unluckily, I didn't pay attention and my sandwich came HOT off the grill:( Just a surprise to watch out for.
One of my favorite places to eat as a vegan. Meat eaters that I bring with me to Ike's love it just as much. If it was near my apartment I'd go there every day, no question. Sooo guuuuddd
Wow is all I can say! My husband and I each got a sandwich which was a mistake because we could have easily shared and even had some left over. The portions are beyond generous and taste fantastic. The dirty sauce was served on the side and was good but not necessary for either sandwich as they stood alone not needing any accompaniments. We called in our sandwiches hoping to not have to wait too long but still had a bit of a wait, but it was well worth it! Ike brought out our sandwiches with a smile and apologized for the wait, which was not necessary at all. Great sandwich joint, well worth the wait anytime!
After a quick stop at the Renegade Craft Fair, the gang and I couldn't decide whether or not we were hungry. Ike's came to mind as a spot to hit up as several of us had heard from it from various sources. Thanks to the wonder known as the Blackberry, we were able to make our way to Ike's. We dropped one of the friends off as we scoured the neighborhood for parking. When we met up with him, it didn't seem like he moved along in the line. Since this place is in a residential neighborhood, the workers constantly come out to make sure people aren't crowding the walkway. It kind of felt like PE class when your'e asked to line up against the wall. Nonetheless, an hour later, we were placing our orders. Twenty minutes after, we waited for our food. I have to say that the Menage a Trois is the best sandwich that has ever touched my lips. It satisfied my tastebuds to the nth level. There's something about that dutch crunch bread and dirty sauce that will keep me coming back for more....and more. Dont worry, I'll bring all my friends with me too!
Amen. I am a convert.
I am new to the Bay Area and am staying in the Castro with a friend till I move in elsewhere. I found this place on Yelp and just checked it out for a grab and go lunch. I got the #18 Tony Soprano and it was AWESOME! Only thing I didn't like was limited seating room and the wait for the sandwich. (about 10-15 min) But the wait was worth it because the meat and cheese was soo nicely melted together with the perfect amount of Italian dressing. I would definitely eat here again but would highly recommend calling in my order next time.
i like you. please continue making awesome sandwiches for me to eat in the bay area sunshine.
Scrumptious to the Delightfullness of my Tummy!! Try the "Back Stabber" or the "Lucky 13"
If you have to wait in line...just do it!These are the best sandwiches in SF.I have been there 5 times and each time I have gotten a different sandwich, each one has been better than the last.My boyfriend LOVES their selection of vegitarian sandwiches.Ikes is the best.
best time to get a sandwich here is right before they close or best bet is to call in....yes yes read the reviews & jumped on the bandwagon~to me roxies is the standard since day 1....i drove by here once lookin fwd to this place & the line was long/packed...so my partner in crime whos a food snob like myself were in the area & on this cold december nite no one was in line =)....i wanted a roast beef everything on it/dutch crunch~homeboy @ the register requested a "nacho boy" heated (roast beef/shrooms/avocados)~lil ed had sum "3 sum sandwich"~i didnt kno what was in it but he killed it lol...the sandwich was very flavorfull & good...its tough to compare with roxies =(....but both are for sure up there...different styles in taste...flavor...location of the joint....
love the nacho girl!
ike, you are never open when i need you to be. sometimes, i'd like to visit you on a weekday - let's just say on a monday or tuesday. do i really have to wait until friday to eat your yummy sandwiches? i mean, what's a working girl, who gets out after 4pm, to do? wait till the weekend i guess.anyhow, i had the meatless mike and thought it was delicious but waaaay too saucy. i'm down with a nice marinara on a faux meatball sub but most def didn't expect the copius amounts of a veganaise based dirty sauce they put on there. made me hella gassy. so here's the lesson i learned - if you don't like mayo type sauce, order whatever you get without the dirty, because apparently they do a double douse of that shit.
i love ike's! period.man- i just love ike and his hot red chef's coat. and his mom.the sandwiches are simply perfect and their homemade bread is delicious. i go for the veggie sanchez elementary and the veggie 'name of the girl you're dating'. yum yum yum. everything is great and almost everything can be vegetarian. perfect for a sunday afternoon. call to order your sandwich and pick it up along with a bottle of bubbly on the way to dolores park. don't let the reservation talk keep you away. just call - it's worth it.
Ike's creative, extensive sandwich menu and Dirty Sauce (house garlic aioli sauce) garners it a lot of well-deserved hype. The Menage a Trois (Halal Chicken Breast, Real Honey, Honey Mustard, BBQ, PepperJack, Swiss, Smoked Gouda) is especially good. But like other extremely popular dives (think Chicago's Hot Doug's), you can expect an outside 1 hr+ wait that's not really worth it so just call ahead.
Ike's Place is so very delicious. I can be a picky orderer/eater and i would try their whole entire menu. plus, putting their special "dirty" sauce will make anything that much tastier. their guilt free fries are better than any regular fries i've had in awhile. (wish they had an actual ketchup bottle instead of those annoying little packets. honestly, my only complaint, and it is so petty.) this is exactly the kind of spot that the castro has been missing. generous portions and cheap prices. this place actually makes my husband full. thanks ike! oh, and the tootsie pops are a fabulous touch.
I love sandwiches, and like most people I was very skeptical and didn't like the idea of paying $9 (after tax) for a sandwich but for this place I will make the exception!FOOD: Although the sandwich was more expensive then most places the sandwich was big enough to fill me up. When I first picked up the sandwich, it was relatively heavy which meant that there was alot of meet inside. On my initial bite I noticed the ham was full of flavor and there was plenty of it, the salami was really good as well. The veges appear to be fresh. The meat / vege ratio was perfect for my tastes (lots of meat, and some eveges). I had my sandwich on dutch crunch (highly recommended in order to keep the sauses and meat inside the sandwich without breaking), and the bread appeared to be fresh as well. The strawberry-kiwi lollipop was a very nice touch!SERVICE: The cashier was VERY curtious, there was some wait but it was expected based on the reviews. I could tell a great deal of care went into making these sandwiches.
I had a meeting tonite and I thought why not get a good sandwich that will satisify me. I got there today as they were closing but they took my order which was great. I was late because I didn't know the anti-war protesters were going around the Mission area of all places and marching down the streets and causing traffic jams all over. I wanted the Reuben but they were out-thanks anti-war protesters (even though I believe in your cause) for making go around SF to get there. I ordered the Philly cheese steak instead and let me tell you it satisfied my hunger and tastebuds and I now forgive those protesters,even though I drove around them with $4 per gallon gas.The only bad thing was I didn't order more than one sandwich and it was a long, long booooooring meeting. F*CK
I swear they put crack in the dirty sauce. It's sooo good. I always order the "Can we still be just friends" with soy cheese.Just went back yesterday and noticed that Ike's staff has tripled and the service is much faster. Although it was worth it to wait 30 min for a sandwich in the past, things were much faster. Go Ikes!
Great sandwiches, and Ike's a great guy. Go support his business! You won't regret it.
worth the wait.worth the money. i want to take Ike home with me and have him create a different sandwich masterpiece every day. SUPerb!
everything from the food to the service is awesome. so awesome that i could care less about eating my turkey burger on my lap. and they have a ton vegan and vegetarian options. so good. going back soon.
Waited almost an hour for sandwiches here. Took 45 min in line before I could even order. The sandwich wasn't best, but it wasn't the best sandwich I've ever had. They have a lot of vegetarian and vegan options though, which my girlfriend liked. I probably would've enjoyed it more if they had taken orders quicker, since you can sit and have a beer at the bar once you've finally ordered.
Haven't been in awhile.. went back earlier this week, and wow! Tons of creative vegetarian options! YUM!!!!
The best sandwiches in SF hands down. Try the Menage a trois. Amazing. You might think the $11.11 price tag on a sandwich is expensive but trust me, it's DEFINITELY worth it! Ike and his mother are very nice people too!
I'm not too big of vegan food, but my friend who is a vegan made me try the Vegan meatball and WOW!! One of the most amazing things I've ever tasted! I couldn't even tell the difference!! This place is definitely one of the best in the city!!
It does not get any better than this! I don't think anyone could make a sandwich better.... the long lines are worth the wait (and I don't wait in line for just anyone)!
PZ: love it! However, I'm interested in the operations efficiency in the kitchen since only 2 PZs can be made per batch (!)  12 minutes. In the end it didn't take that long and we all got our PZ's at the same time. (yey!)
It's the dirty sauce that does it...nothing like a good sauce to make a sandwich drippin' delicious.
I've lived in the Castro nearly 20 years, and have hoped and dreamed for a place like this. When your not right on Market Street, it's hard sometimes to make your business take off, but this guy is bringing a much needed sandwich shop to the neighborhood. Ike seems to be a great guy, sporting an interesting half beard, and an amazing menu of "good looking sandwiches", as well as salads, coffee drinks, ice cream, shakes, and some great vegetarian options. Personally, I don't care much for the latter (frickin' veggies RUIN staff and big group dinners all the time with their selfish "I don't eat meat" BS, don't they?) but to make it in this town, ya gotta have it, and he has some nice selections. Detail has been taken with the food, condiments, and toppings, all quite unique, very fresh and so nicely put together. I have had 3 sammys there ( the #1, Ike's pick is named Elvis something, I forget, but it was a delicious terriaki chicken, as well as his BLT with avocado, very yummy, just to name a couple) the combinations and names are really original and fun, and I look forward to munching my way through his menu. In contrast to the interesting and delicious concoctions Ike has created, when I bit into my last sandwich from there, I was reminded of the old-school and sorely missed Viking Sandwich Shop from back in the day, remember that one, playas? The substantial big sammy finished off in the hot oven with melting golden brown melted cheese bubbles....mmmm, I'm going to try Ike's for breakfast RIGHT NOW! Oh yeah, and he has a cute and really friendly staff working for him, and the place is so clean and tidy. Don't let this one fail, my hungry yelpers!
The sandwiches and fries were awesome, but what really impressed me on my first visit to Ike's Place was the friendliness of the staff (and Ike himself), and the level of service. I felt like they really wanted me to have the best sandwich ever (without any pretense). And so, I had the best sandwich ever. The end. Prices aren't bad, either, considering the quality and size of the product.
Great sando. I had Jerris BIG Meat Sandwich - turkey, roast beef, pastrami, ham, salami + cheese. Went down well, but I was hurting for about 24 hours after. Felt like Animal Farm was being acted out in my stomach, and the characters were all fighting each other. I'm going lighter next time. Somebody had to try it though...
waited saturday afternoon for about 40 minutes. had the super mario - meatballs with mozzerella sticks in it. yep, i'm a fatty. sandwich was good - but just not sure if it was 11.00 good...
yum. so freakin delicious. i split the superman with my boyfriend and we had leftovers. that totally never happens! i also love the matt cain and the menage a trois. the lines are terrible, even now at lime, but i always call in my sandwiches so the wait time isn't really an issue. plus, i've heard they will be getting a new location, right by their old one, that will have seating. yay!
I know Ike's is all the rage now, and I have to agree with folks here: the sandwiches are extraordinary. I doubt anyone would be disappointed.My only areas of criticism are they get our choice of bread mixed up on me and my partner's sandwiches more often than not (grrrr) and the place really could use a cleaning. If they would just power wash the sidewalk out front which is pretty disgusting, and keep it a little cleaner inside, I'd have been another enthusiastic 5-star giver.
Great sandwich combinations, great prices. A must stop for sure! I suggest the Obama.
Ike is a super nice guy and makes killer salads as well as sandwiches. Not too many places to sit and eat but the food and service were both excellent. Good location with plenty of parking at lunchtime. I will return!
The vegi BLT that I had at Ike's today is most definitely the best sandwich I've ever had. The bacon is just the morning star farms stuff that you can get in the supermarket, but that's okay. The sourdough was great and the avocado spread delicious. I just moved here and am definitely going back there for every other sandwich on the menu!
declined since moving to Lime! is it me or has prices gone up? after standing in line for 25 minutes I placed my order of 3 paul reubans and after waiting 25 minutes to get my order I was given 3 sandwiches I did not order but sadly I was already back at home with my family who were mad I spend so much money and got crap-I was left on hold forever when I tried to call and complain and my call never returned-I would hope one day I will get my 3 paul reubans but I somehow doubt it
Rocking! Ike is SO nice & the food is SO good.Dirty sauce is Ike's take on aoli. Yummage biggage.
Since I moved to SF I have been looking for a good sandwich place - a really good sandwich place - but had yet to find any establishment that made me think, "I have finally found a place I really want to come back to." Ike's is great, and I am so glad I live around the corner so I don't have to drag my ass all the way from some other neighborhood - which I would do, by the way, because I think it's worth it. I had to drop a star because there were no tomatoes the afternoon I was there, and tomatoes are essential for many sandwiches; but I think it is likely just a new business getting the hang of inventory needs. It actually doesn't surprise me that they would run out of stuff considering how good it is and how much of a customer base they have probably built in the time Ike's has been open. There was a longer wait for a sandwich than you would expect, but it's worth it -- and you can call ahead with your order. AND, the sauce that is mentioned in other reviews really is pretty awesome.UPDATE - I got another sandwich here today and I don't care about the tomato thing I wrote about above. Five stars. This place has to stay!Another update - back to four stars. The amount of microwaved bacon on some of these sandwiches is just scary. The last sandwich I got induced a dream sequence where I was holding my own heart in my hands and it exploded. Fifty strips, Ike? Really? I'll still keep going back, but I'm not thrilled with having to remove and dispose of more than half of the meat.
After yet another miserable time at the worst consumer store in the history of mankind (Best Buy), I went in to Ike's and had the greatest sandwich of my life, the Change.Steak, BBQ Sauce, Onion rings. DELICIOUS. Maybe a heart-attack down the road, but for now there is nothing I want more.
Simply the best sandi place in SF The menu is deep and varied, the staff attentive. Since May's closed, I am so glad to see that the spirit lives on
Its a OK place, nothing special, just surrounded by lots of hype and long lines. I think people (hipsters) like the gritty nature of this restaurant because it looks like its set up to disappear when the feds come. There are no tables, one paper menu, and a ghetto ass kitchen. Ike is short, bald, and a douche.  The vegetarian selection is nice but the prices are 11 dollars and up per sandwich. I would go across the street to Dinosaurs and get a nice vietnamese sandwich for under 5 bucks! you could also get 2 different sandwiches for less then 10 dollars and be nice and full.  The people working there are much nicer too. Ikes is okay taste but honestly just make a sandwich at home or go to dinosaurs.
To be honest, I don't see what all the hype is about...I waited an hour for a sandwich that tasted like it was made at Safeway. Shredded chicken, some creamy sauce, a few canned artichokes, lettuce, tomatoe, and cheese all on a standard dutch crunch roll. the staff was a total mess, i could whip these sandwiches out faster and tastier!I'm a pretty serious East Coast sandwich eater and haven't really been impressed by too many SF sandwich shops this far. I could make this sandwich better myself at home, in a fraction of the time for a fraction of the price. An hour for a $10 mediocre sandwich?I gladly wait an hour for a $10 sandwich at Koch's in Philly, but that sandwich is tripple decker, home made everything, including a layer of chopped liver. The thing weighs a pound and is easily two meals. And while you wait in line they give you samples. Does anyone know if a place like this exists in SF??? hollyeats.com/Kochs.htmI should have gotten a burrito...
Quite possibly the best sandwich I've ever had. The Saturday afternoon crowd was a bit daunting, but our food was out before I even started to get frustrated and immediately upon scarfing my delicious chips. Perfect timing!
i do love ike's sandwiches! i really do, but the wait was just ridiculously long. i seriously waited 6 hours for 4 sandwiches. it's really intense! the owner is super friendly and so are their staffs.
I love Ike's. I loved Ike's before all the hipsters found out about this place, now they seem to round in front like a herd waiting to go to pasture. I still love Ike's and usually do not Yelp a place with this many ratings. However, today things changed. A couple friends and I decided we would like a sammy to relax at home with, whist we all enjoyed the day off. We know it usually takes 45 minutes to make an order and get our sammy's. Fine. But today, it crossed the line and I doubt that I will be going back to Ike's (unless they wake up and get it together)....they wanted us to wait 2 hours for our order of 3 sammy's, that my friend, is not customer service I abide by. However, word on the street is they tell you these inflated times because they are fundamentally opposed to phone orders. Too bad. Luckily, BiRite sammy's are amazing, cost the same (and they don't charge you $1.01 to add avocado and BiRite use sustainable organic ingredients unlike Ike's). For now, my business is best suited at BiRite or any other sandwich shop (even M&L Market).
woweeee....can you say perfection? from service to sandwich.. everything was exactly as i expected and even more. hey vegans?! get you butts over here and eat the meatless meatball sandwich. its smothered in marinara sauce and topped with soy cheese. ok, so that doesnt sound that appetizing but trust me. my boyfriend who is all carnivore even loved it. however, you must get it on the dutch crunch roll.. crunchy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside... perfection i say... purrrrfect. but what made the experience so unforgettable was the great service from the workers. Not only was the man taking the orders polite and patient (despite the fact that there was a line forming behind me) ike himself hand delivers the sandwich to you. whadda man...
I have the Papa Sam today, it was delicious. It was like a Tina melt with salmon. Only thing is there are only 3 tables for everyone. I would like sit down and enjoy my meal...
Im tired of this overrated hipster joint and the annoying owner with the napoleonic complex. I used to go all the time and then slowly it all went downhill. Much rather go to Mr. Pickles.
I think it's the bread that makes it so good. I'm pretty sure it comes to them half baked and then they finish baking it when you order the sandwich so it's all warm and fresh with the cheese melted. this was the impression i got and DAMN, dude its really good. worth waiting twenty minutes at least, too.
Nothing I can say that hasn't already been said - these guys rock. My five star review shares my feelings. I love the Change and the Wario (it's just the the Mario, but with veggie meatballs).
The Ike's Place of lore. I immediately poked my head in to see if I could see the man who is the default picture on Yelp but too no avail. I ordered the Tony Soprano on Dutch Crunch and wench got the Nacho Boy. There was a long wait but I guess 'tis the price you pay when it made national television. However, the shopkeepers were very cordial. Our sandwiches came out and to tell you the truth, my knees didn't buckle. I was very confused so I took another bite, expecting my legs to turn to jello. Nada. It is not some magical sandwich after all; it was good but I wouldn't cut off a finger for one. The bread was really good and the dirty sauce gave it a very good flavor. They did not scimp on the meat. The lolly was a nice touch. I love those caramel lollies...brought me to the days of the student store at my middle school 10+ years ago. Mr. Pickles is just as good minus the selection however I refuse to give Ike's one more star for having 2 boards as a menu. It is an above average sandwich.
This place made me want to move to SF. It's SOOO Good.
WOW - these sandwiches are pretty amazing! I am not a big sandwich person, but these are sooooo good. I've tried the Nacho Boy and the Do You Smell What Barack is Cooking on Dutch Crunches are both were delicious. I felt awful when I heard that Ike's is being sued by neighbors and promptly bought a t-shirt to support. Yes, the wait can be painful, but call ahead!
you know i flew to sf for the weekend from seattle -- and this is the only place i BEGGED my friend to take me =D=] my friend gave me crap for making him take me to castro for a couple sandwiches but --- he loved them too! i wouldn't say the sandwiches are TO DIE FOR but they are damn good -- the 5-star is for (the sandwiches AND) how nice Ike is =D he accommodated my "reservations," never hesitated to help a n00b pick out sandwiches, and even called me by name. i can NOT wait to go back - til' then i'll stick to seattle's pride and joy sandwich place (paseo's).Hi Ike!
after reading all the reviews, my friend and i stopped by a couple of weeks ago. it was a nice sunny and warm day in the city so we ate our sanwiches outside his place.the rueben was incredible, not sure if this is whay they actually call it but it was juicy, meat falling out, great bread. just amazing.the employee sandwich which i think was chicken and artichoke hearts was just okay. the meat was a little dry but overall the rest of it including the bread and artichokes was very flavorful. i like this place because Ike is a very nice guy and they have much to offer. you cant beat great service. despite the fact i didnt like one sandwich, there's lots of other choices which i will be certain to try again.thanks, Ike - you and your employees make this a great place.
Love this place' great service great sandeiches. Lack of seating but you make do. Ike is great as well! I'm a fan of strawberry girl on dutch crunch and meatless mike. Yummmm!
i think someone who lives in my house or has adopted our house is at ike's at least once a day. the other day me and my roommate went for bfast AND dinner...so i felt it was time to pay my respects. ikes, your sandwiches, you, your lovely mom, and the trivia pursuit sitting inside the cafe are glorious. my fav so far has been the vegetarian meatball sub, and im not even veggie.
Oh.My.God. This place is unbelievable! When I drive in from LA, I dont even go to my hotel first to check-in,I come here for my Nacho Boy sandwich (on Dutch Crunch of course). I'm always on the hunt for good sandwich places (seeing as how LA has none really),and this place is it! The bread is good. The "dirty sauce" is good (it's like creamy garlic spread or something). The meat and all the fixings are perfect compliments to each other. Not like anything I've ever had before. If you're on the fence about visiting,go,you won't be disappointed!
i do have to agree with the recent one star review in the sense that this place is way over hyped, but preferring subway or quiznos? that's just plain stupid.First off, the service is great. every employee i encountered was incredibly hospitable despite how overwhelming busy it was. if you're gonna complain about waiting too long, maybe you should go to a less crowded place (LOGIC IN ACTION). The place is a hole in the wall, so i wont complain about lack of seating. If you are vegan or vegetarian (which i am not) i can tell that this place will probably be great for you.So why three stars? the sandwich was just disappointing. Not bad, just nothing special. there was a fair amount of meat and a minimal amount of pretty much everything else. when i order everything on a sandwich and pay extra for bacon and avocado, i expect it to be THICK, not something that i have no difficulty fitting my mouth around. And the dirty sauce? just tastes... dirty.All in all, not a bad sandwich but totally over-hyped. Try Mr. Pickles on 20th and South Van Ness instead or the Toaster Over on 2nd and Mission.
This is my 3rd time to Ike's and although I like the sandwiches the wait and the prices make this place a rare event. Don't get me started on the seating, this place really needs to expand. The staff are very friendly and always willing to help. Drop the prices and the wait and I'd give this place 5 stars.
I consider myself a sandwich guru. In fact, I live and die by the opportunity to enjoy hearty, unique, tummy satisfying sandies. Ike's meets all of those criteria, which would explain why you must have a weekend reservation to eat here. Thankfully for me I am determined and though I have the worst luck ever, I popped into Ike's at the perfect time (between reservations). Ike was working and was able to pull a superhuman move, creating sandwiches for me and my boyfriend in little to no time. Ike mentioned that he woke up from dreaming about a sandwich (which in itself pretty much describes his passion for fantastical ingredients between slices of bread). My chicken sandwich was so good (named something creative like "Your Ex-Girlfriend's Name") that it is worthy of dreams. I love Ike.
The guys that work here are pretty cute. Oh yeah, they make good sandwiches too. It's a little hard to find parking if you're there to just pick up, so call in an order and double park in front. :)
Overrated. I live nearby and don't understand why people wait in line so long. Maybe it's because it was on Man vs. Food, but the sandwiches just aren't that great. They're messy and sloppy.
I lived in SF for over 4 years before visiting Ike's. Now I've been there 3 times in the last month. I love that there are veggie versions of nearly every sandwich. I love that the staff is amazingly friendly, despite the high volume of customers. Most of all, I love the dirty sauce. My favorite sandwich so far has been the Peg Bundy, eggplant, avocado, smoked gouda, french dressing...you can't lose. Their version of Monte Cristo is great too: turkey, ham, swiss and strawberry jam...sounds weird but don't knock it till you tried it. They just upped the prices, but now you get free chips and I can't finish a whole one anyway so 2 meals for $10 is pretty sweet. The line also isn't too bad if you go around 4 or 5pm. The only issue is, if you're not going to finish them, make sure you get those sammies in the fridge pronto. Last time it took us 2 hours to refridgerate our leftovers and we had tummy aches after we ate them the next day. That's not Ike's fault though, that's my dumb-ass fault.
o m g - i am only here for two weeks, and fortunately for me, the first place my buddy took me to when i landed was ike's! oh, day 2 and i already need a fix of ike's super tasty sandwiches. what will i do when i leave?! ike - any interest in opening up one in boston?! please! ugh! thank you for super tasty sandwiches. peace.
A hole in the wall that offers really great sandwiches. Definitely would come back here again. Offering a better side to the sandwich like chips or fries rather than a measly tootsie pop would push them to 5 stars.
Oh Ike's. I was sad when you left, and joyous when you returned. I went to the new location yesterday and was pleased when I saw no line. I don't know if its because it was the end of the day but our sandwiches were just lacking. I expected a goopy spicy delicious mess of a sandwich...but it was just a mess. My order was pretty much wrong...and so was my roommate's. We love Ike's and we really hoping for a wonderful experience now that they were back, but I didn't finish my sandwich, and wasn't pleased with my 12 buck sub.
I grew up and went to school on the east coast. Going to college in Philadelphia taught me that one could elevate something as universal as a sandwich to stratospheric heights. This is why, on many a hungover Saturday morning I spent up to an hour and a half waiting in line at Koch's deli, getting the occasional free meat and cheese samples, served with a side of corny humor. But the sandwiches were THAT GOOD, that we all waited happily.In over ten years I've lived in the Bay Area since, I've had to endure sandwiches with more bread than meat, sprouts, sprouted bread, sun dried tomatoes, and a host of other offenses too numerous to list, each more horrifying than the last, and of course nowhere near the high water mark set by Koch's deli in West Philadelphia.Cut to Ike's deli. I've recently spent a year living abroad, and have since returned to the Bay Area. Lucky for me, I'm walking distance to what has become a ritual repeated several times a week. No other sandwich I've had in the Bay Area is even close to the level of product delivered at Ike's, and I'm happy to say I've found my west coast Koch's, finally. That said, I'd certainly recommend Koch's if you're ever in West Philly -- try the hot brisket hoagie. Hey Ike --any chance for brisket on the menu any time soon?EDIT: Okay, maybe I was a bit quick to condemn sprouts and sun-dried tomatoes. I got kind of wrapped up in my little rant. But I stand by the spirit of what I was saying -- many west coast sandwiches are wrong. Just wrong. Like east coast burritos.
Had the Barry Z. - Delicious! Roasted Turkey, cheese, avocado, and I was a happy camper. I think it took me longer to decide rather than to eat the sandwich. There are about 4 tables outside so you'll have to stalk the people currently sitting there if you want a seat. I will DEFINITELY be coming back to try more of their sandys.
I have been to this place about 5 times. Upon my second visit I was greeted by name, and welcomed like an old friend. WHO DOES THAT???? If every business treated their customers like Ike's does, there would be world peace.The best sandwich I have ever had in my LIFE is the 'Backstabber'.There's a reason why you wait insane amounts of time for your sandwich. Every one is made carefully and to order. I think his concept is brilliant.No pretention, no fuss. Just great sandwiches..... Rock on, Ike.... Rock on!!!!
YUM!! Try a "Say Hey" with Jalapeno poppers!!
just go!
Unless I ever taste a better sandwich, this place gets 5 stars.
I like to think I'm a connoisseur of sandwiches. I also am very picky when it comes to my sammies. Something so simple is so easy to wreck...but not here at Ike's! Trust the reviews: this place is WORTH it - despite the appointments, the lines, the crowds. It's just that good. I had the backstabber sandwich and it was fabulous if you like Caesar salad dressing: shredded chicken, dressing, veg, vegan dirty sauce (the regular has egg and my bf is allergic) on a dutch crunch roll. SO good, especially with a side of their baked fries. Be warned that the sandwiches are messy, so don't come there thinking that you're going to leave clean - it's nearly impossible! The staff makes this place that much better: if they know you're an Ike virgin, they will make some suggestions to make sure that you get something memorable. Free trade, great food, wonderful neighborhood...there's nothing else you need! And I when I met Ike, I almost cried because I was so happy. Ike = Duff from Ace of Cakes.
This place is good if you know what you are getting into. For a first timer there are many frustrations such as the incomplete menu in the window WITHOUT prices or notification that there are other sandwiches avail in the printed menu. Normally sandwiches do not cost $12 as they do here, so i generally like to know this before I get to the front of the line. The wait AFTER ordering is 20-30 min. These are sandwiches not souffees...it does not take that long to make a sandwich. Aside from this, the sandwiches are good...i'd recommend calling your order ahead of time for pick up.
Great Sandwiches, but not liking the new temporary location. Not the same vibe and not as comfortable. Not cool that the residents kicking them out of their spot.
deeelicious. my little cousin mentioned that we had to go to ike's when we get to sf. so one day we ventured out to get our ike fix. not being very hungry, my little cousin and I decided to share a sandwich (honey mustard and avocado sandwich) which in hindsight was a bad decision. it was so good I could have eaten another one. I ate shivering in the cold in the middle of golden gate park, a bit sad that I was sharing the other half. harharhar.
Awesome! So much to choice. The portions are great, half a sandwich filled me up, and about the same price as other sandwich shops in the city. Plus the staff are helpful and friendly. Will for sure be going back!
It's great to get off of work a little bit early, especially as we swing into summer. Sometimes I take the 24 home; I exit on 16th street, and walk down the hill, across Market, and stop by Ike's for a delicious late lunch sandwich. Perfection.
damn good eli manning sandwich. worth. every. bite.
Heard about this place after watching an episode of Man vs Food and had to check it out. They said the lines were long but who knew i would have to wait in line for almost 2 hrs for a sandwich!! I tried calling it ahead and the wait was 3 hrs. Well in the end I have to say that by Obama bbq beef samich was good, but I'm not sure if it was worth waiting in line for 2 hrs. I'll be back again, but next time I'll call ahead 3 hrs earlier
We have been "yelping" our way around the bay area for the last few weeks and are trying to find the ultimate sandwich. This place is one of them for sure.  We arrived as they were filming "Eye on the Bay" (channel 5) and watched them rave about the food as well. I can still taste the dirty sauce and the bread.
its okay. not worth all the hype. also expensive for what it is. i've had better and i didn't have to deal with all the hipsters. they get props for the success of the business and the cute cashier
The best sandwich joint in the Bay Area. The pastrami was elegantly delicious. The proprietor is the most passionate sandwich maker I have ever met. Most places on Yelp, I find to be over rated. Not this place!
I don't just like Ike's, I LOVE it!!. The line is long, but worth it. Ike also takes phone orders for those who can't wait. Here's a tip: ALWAYS get EXTRA dirty sauce! This makes the sandwich amazing, even more that it already is. Everytime I am in the city, I stop by. I cannot wait until the one in Santa Rosa opens... I will be an Ike's lover for life!
I love Ike's. Go for an adventuresome sandwich and Ike's will not disappoint. Who knew that jalapeno poppers are so yummy on a sandwich? Ike knew, that's who!
Yummy Sandwiches!!! The wait is longer than i expected but it was worth it...
trust me...go. of course, you needn't believe me...read the friggin reviews. 1900+ and four stars?! i drove by for a *year* and scoffed at the morons waiting in a line half a block long. the sandwiches are brilliant. meat, veggie or vegan. it don't matter. at first i thought, "hmmmm, i should try this sandwich again when i'm not stoned..." because i would have eaten it off the sidewalk, but tried them completely sober and they are still dee-lish. they must put coke in them...they're so addicting. signed, a moron
My friend and I both waited about an hour and a half from the time we got in line to the time we actually got our food. This is not your ordinary sit-down fast food joint. The place itself is a cash register right by the door. Lucky for us, we just arrived for happy hour (7pm-8pm). Meaning, the side of chips and drinks were free. The Funky Fusion chips were amazing. The Chocolate Tea, to die for. Yes, you heard that right: CHOCOLATE TEA. And of course, the sandwich was INSANELY GOOD. I told Adrian while we were mackin' our sandwiches in his rental car that I never in my life have ever made love to a sandwich before. The bread they use was amazing. They slather it with their signature "Dirty Sauce." They also have a vegan/vegetarian menu (hello, SF). We both ordered the "Manage-a-trois." Yes, I had an amazing manage-a-trois last night. In the car even. So next time you are in the neighborhood, stop by Ike's Place near the Castro.
Best sandwich shop I've ever been to - definitely go with the dutch crunch bread! The place meets any expectations you could possibly have and its always worth the wait. The Jim Rome and Barack is Cooking are awesome
i came here after viewing man vs. food since i was in the sf area.the menu is ridiculous and requires so much time since there are so many choices and every item makes your mouth water.since i was on a mini-vacay, my time was short and i knew that the line would be ridiculous around lunch. I called ahead and placed an order at 11, i was told my sandwich would be ready at 11:30. I had the "not tonight, i have a headache" no pickles or onions,my bf had the "shawn michaels" no veggiesmy girl had the "shawn michaels" with everythingand her bf had the "ex-boyfriend" with everything all of us on wheat bread...ordered water and chips...let us say that 3 of the 4 of us finished the sandwich in less than 6 mins. With that said, i forgot to take a picture, it smelled and looked so yummy that i put it in my mouth asap. it was so good, that i never put it down! my girl ate a bag of chips with half the sandwich, but kept the other half for later, it was that good! We agreed, this is a place that must be tried again, we must try everything in order to really know! but was so yummy and unique, no other sandwich shop i have ever tried...this is not at all like subways, togos, quiznos....who puts mozzeralla sticks in a sandwich? ingenious!
ike's rock. Ike rocks. everyone at ike's rocks!serriously, ike's makes amazingly yummy sandwiches. and there are so many to choose from (though i way too often get the paul rubens (ruben) or the PZ burger (the best burger in the area)
All I did was smell the sandwiches my friends got and I was a believer! But of course, knowing my luck, I was too full from lunch to have a dinner sandwich :( I ended up getting the Caesar salad which was actually pretty good because they made the dressing themselves. We were eating in the car like three little piggy's and those sandwiches looked and smelled reaaaaaaallllly good. Too bad I wasn't hungry! I ate a quarter of my salad (it was, like $5) and still had a TON leftover. I took it home and finished it late at night and it was then, did I appreciate the fine craftsmanship of my salad. As I was sitting under the covers, watching Family Guy and munching on this salad, I was thinking to my self, "If this Ike character can make salad THIS good, what other magic can he create with his hands? A statue of David? A Mona Lisa?" The answer, my friends, is a kick ass sandwich. Anyways, I hope to see this Ike guy real soon, with appetite in tow. Final Verdict: I curse myself for the ONE day I didn't feel like eating. Be fore warned, this place has limited seating! I can't wait to come back and try what their known for. One whiff of these sandwiches and I'm crawling back for more!
Best sandwiches ever. A whole sandwich fills me up -- so the perfect sunny San Francisco Sunday afternoon meal would be more like a half sandwich from Ike's, and then ice cream from Bi-Rite. For gooey sandwiches (eg., dirty sauce), I prefer the sourdough bread, because its crunchy exterior helps the sandwich maintain its robustness.
Tiny place. 4 or 5 small tables on the sidewalk, against the storefront and along the curb. Printed menus above the counter supplemented by a dozen or so hand-written signs with names, descriptions, and sometimes illustrations. Friendly employees. Frequent Ike sightings.When they ask if you want everything on it, the answer is always "Yes." Trust these people; they are sandwich-making gods.First time: Had the Barry Z. Amazing. Split it with my lunch companion, and still had to pocket our Tootsie Pops for later.
Jesus Christ!
hey ike! i think you'll be happy to hear that i actually got my sandwich WITH dirty sauce! it was yesterday (or was it the day before?) that i took that leap of faith, and i didn't suffer from any of those nasty, filthy stomach cramps i used to get. mind you, it's been a VERY LONG time since i actually had mayo, and maybe the past 5 years have been good to me or maybe i stepped on dog shit and god felt i needed something to feel good about. who knows, but next time, i will order my paul reuben DIRTY!
i don't mind lining up for great food (mama's is still my #1 breakfast spot). and ike's place is no exception. i didn't have to wait long today but calling in advance is definitely the way to go. ike's place was immediately added to my contacts after my first bite of the ex-boyfriend. and then there's the nacho boy - both boys rocked my world. the people here are super awesome, too. i can't wait to try the hella fat bastard, heath ledger, superman...who am i kidding - i'm probably going to cover most of the meat menu. ike's place is all that...AND A FREE BAG OF SALT & VINEGAR CHIPS!
Sandwhiches so good I can't get enough of them here in Long Beach. My aunt was coming down to visit us from the bay and I made her bring me down some of Ike's famous sandwiches. It's only been a day and I ate them all up already. Now I must wait to make a trip to the bay for my next fix.......
5 stars, namely b/c it is the best sandwich shop I've been too in San Francisco. Their sandwiches are fantastic and the quality is very consistent. The only thing I would mention is it is fairly crowded inside, and there is some outdoor seating, so I would recommend calling in an order 10-15 minutes ahead and getting a sandwich to go.
Worst sandwich I have ever had.we waited 2 hrs for our food and we both hated our sloppy nasty puke sandwich
dirty secret sauce + dutch crunch! they serve really good sandwiches here, i'm not a sandwich person but Ike's is an exception. big portions + a lot of sandwiches to pick from is such a good deal.
5 Stars for food, 5 stars for service and 5 billion stars for incredible KARMA - this place is everthing San Francisco is all about - love and peace, friendly folks, killer food, fun and sexy AND reasonable $$ - YES - I'm sending a big-wet- veggie-elvis KISS to all the wonderful employees that bring us Ike's sandwiches every single day of the year. I take all my east coast friends to Ikes and they all fall in love, veggie and carnees alike agree- its the best sammy in the galaxy - hardest part ? You got it - choosing!! I always say I'm gonna be adventurous and order something besides the veggie elvis, but ....I rarely do, thinking I might do it today...hmmmm, i dunno, will let ya know the outcome - thanks Ike - you DA BEST
good sandwiches. weird names. kinda like if you took mr. pickles and improved upon it a bunch.
I'm so obsessed with Ike that my boyfriend is jealous. He has my heart in the palm of his hand. Those wonderful hands have created some amazing sandwiches.
A friend told me his whole company was going to this place after work on Friday's, and despite not usually like sandwiches, I came along. That was six months ago, and most of the staff now know me by name, as well as by order. The sandwiches are huge, hot, fresh, and amazing. Not to mention the french fries. Seriously, these things are orange (I refuse to ask what they put on them, I'm afraid it'll ruin the mystery!), and just a tad spicy! Every single one of my out of town friends gets dragged for sandwiches, and two have come back purely because of them. A great place that will be around forever I hope!
everything I've tried has been great.fast service, delicious sandwiches. I love to phone in my order, then when I get there my sandwich is already ready already. grab a cane sugar sweetened soda and have yourself a feast.I wish they were open right now, I would be choosing a sandwich off their website whilst I was typing this.
The line was long, but that is maybe what makes it taste better. If it weren't for the line, I would give it 5 stars. I got a hot pastrami with cheddar on dutch crunch. Big sandwich, tasty cheese. I would definitely go back.
i do not even like sandwiches, but Ikes is the best.... its the only place I go to for sandwiches.... the bread is always fresh...and it is worth the wait... that's half the fun.... although, the line is definitely shorter on the weekdays....
i LOVE the sandwiches at ike's...though in truth i have never tried anything beyond the barry z. i am one of those (annoying) people who can't stop making noises when they eat something they find amazing...and let me just say...every time i go to ike's...it's almost "When Harry Met Sally"-esque. thanks ike, and thanks to all you beautiful employees.p.s. nadia rocks my world/body
I'd pretty much given up finding a decent Sammy in SF. The Cheese Store in Cole Valley being my default go to. Well Ike's place is serving the best ones in the City. Period. Give your self half an hour after ordering...these people are not quick.
I'd never heard of Ike's until last weekend. My friend positioned this place as the best, and I repeat best sandwich shop in the city. So as you can imagine I was very skeptical( that's just how I am). My friend is Vegan so she ordered the vegan combo, and I wanted to order a sandwich with avocado,but they were conveniently out. Instead of getting angry( as I sometimes do) I ordered a simple turkey sandwich with lettuce,cucumbers, tomato, and yellow mustard. As it turns out that simple turkey sandwich was one of the best darn sandwiches I've ever had. The bread and turkey were served hot and the veggies were fresh and delicious. Ike came out and casually introduced himself. He's a very cool guy with a mellow disposition.I'm now a believer and I would go to Ike's everyday if I lived close by. The wait was short, but it was a Friday evening .Check out Ike's.
The food here is fantastic. It was one of those places that I ran in to pick something up when I first moved to the city and have been back every week since. If you haven't been you should take the time to stop by. There is usually a wait but well worth the time. The food is great and second only to the great staff.
Probably the best sandwich I've ever eaten! Haven 't been to the new location yet, but the old location had an extremely long line. Plan ahead, but worth the wait!
So we where looking for something new to eat and what comes to mind??? Sandwich's.......Keep in mind this is the dinner hour and we want sandwich's haha. So we check out Yelp and this was one of the highest rated sandwich joints in SF. So we check out their website.....omfg I've never seen a spot with this many freaking options for sandwich's . Makes it kinda hard to decide. They all have some pretty funny names to just going over the menu was kinda funny. You gotta love a place that has a sandwich called Montana 2 Rice man that alone made me want to order it but i wasn't feeling a meatball sandwich at the time. So i decide on a Dirty CA Roll which is a shrimp & imitation crab sandwich. My friend decides on a Nacho boy which is hot roast beef, mushrooms, avocado, and swiss. So my boy tells me that the reviews recommend calling 20 minutes in advance to order prior to getting there. I was like huh what kinda sandwich place is this that you need to order sandwich's 20 minutes in advance. So we call in and the phone rings and rings and rings nobody answers. So being a bit disappointed we hang up and start heading to our plan B location. As soon as we get in the car my boy gets a call back from Ike's and the guy was like did you wanna order a sandwich? Surprising and pretty cool. So we try to remember the name of our sandwich's order and start heading over. 15 minutes later we parked a block away and walk over. First impression when we saw the spot was wow its a serious tiny hole in the wall. 3-4 customers max can be inside at 1 time and its all outdoor seating. So I grab a table outside while my boy gets the grub and its dark and cold but hey i grew up in the City i can handle it haha. So the moment of truth comes and we are ready to dig in. This is when I find out that all their sandwich's are prepared from scratch as you order. This means the bread is even fresh baked. That was pretty impressive. The first bite we both had the same reaction of Damm this is a bomb sandwich. We both had dutch crunch rolls and i have to tell you fresh baked dutch crunch.......you have to try it for yourself freaking amazing. We wolf down the sandwich's and are very satisfied. Trust me folks all the positive reviews of this place are not BS. It's pretty damm amazing. So this is rare because i don't give out 5 stars easily but this is how they went from a 4 star to a 5 star. Baked to order bread just put them over the top. I hate to do this to Little Lucca's because i only gave them 4 but Ike's truly deserves all 5 stars.....
Oh my goodness... one of the tastiest sandos I've ever had :P I got the That's Too Bad and i can't wait to try one of the others on this huge menu!!
very creative sandwiches
If you're claiming all veg, Ike's got your back. like the vegan meatball marinara sub, which confirms that a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich. I'm so happy to be unemployed--I can go to Ike's on a Tuesday afternoon and have some alone time with my sandwich.
This place makes great sandwiches with a plethora of variety. Watch for the price though as two sandwiches ran me, with two root beers, nearly 30 bucks. We're talking about sandwiches here. Still worth trying out.
more like a 4.5 but whatevs. ike is really cool and so are his staff. with the amount of orders and people they have to deal with, i've never once seen them be a jerk to anyone, even when the person deserved it. the food: that sandwich is just pure gluttony. got the milf (seriously) which is halal chicken, jalapeno poppers on some dirty bread. sooo good. even if they didn't put crazy things like moz sticks and stuff in their sandwiches, they would still be great. they use really quality stuff and put a lot of care into the sandwiches. believe the hype.
People are crazy. I got the veggie BLT and it was tasty but nothing to write home about. Sandwich, water, tip was $10.00. I think the cheapness of this place is why all of the younger people here go berserk. Despite the veggieness of the sandwich it was predominately lettuce, mayo and bread. They use good heavy duty mayo which I attribute to their entire success.
Went for the first time last week and was in heaven. Normally, I'm not a huge fan of sandwiches just because they tasted pretty plain, but Ike's has the BEST sandwiches anywhere. I got a Nacho Boy and was very happy with my choice. We waited in line for about an hour, but it was definitely worth the wait. If you can, call in ahead of time so you can pick up your sandwich later. But if you're already there, it's faster to wait than to call. The people who work there are also super nice!
hollywood's sf cheese steak on dutch crunch was delicious! definitely worth the wait.
Ike's is amazing! The staff is great and the sandwiches are even better. It's definitely worth the wait!
I guess it's a moot point because the place is about to close, I heard. But what's with all the four- and five-star ratings? I waited 70 minutes for THIS? They should have paid me interest on the money I spent, given the length of the wait. It's your basic sandwich shop -- nothing really special except the flash mob that stretches down the block. The food was okay, but just okay. I think it's more about the scene and the hype. Those that were enjoying the wait and the scene the most were faux hipsters (yes, not even real hipsters, fake ones!). LOL I guess it's okay if you're more about people-watching than food.
My husband and I live around the corner from this place. We JUST tried it - and we love it. How could we not? Ike is a genius, he is redefining sandwiches - it is not just food, it is an experience. So good - I ate the Backstabber with chicken, ranch dressing, provolone, etc. Super delicious. My husband had the Pizzle which has chicken, bacon, cheddar and ranch. I don't eat mammal but tried a bite and am rethinking my food philosophy. The bacon goes perfectly on this sandwich.
Although I'm giving this place 4 stars, there's something about it that doesn't make me LOVE it but I'm not sure what it is. It could be that we went on a Tuesday around 11:30am and somehow they ran out of the delicious looking fries. I guess I did enjoy the sandwich even though it looked like a glob and was really messy to eat. I think I got [Name of Girl I'm Dating] and the boy got the Change. Both good but I feel like I've eaten better sandwiches for a cheaper price. Since we came before the rush there was only 2 people ahead of us and only a couple of the outside seating was taken. It did take a while for our order even though there wasn't a rush so I can't even imagine how long the wait would be if a longer line had formed. There is definitely no room in the place for you to just stand around and wait for your order. Overall, I'd like to give this place a 3 1/2 because it didn't really wow me much but because I'm nice I'm rounding up.
I've had a negative connotation associated with "Ike" since that mother of a hurricane devastated the gulf last year and left many of our friends and family without power for several weeks at the least. But last Sunday, this little place and the owner, Ike himself, served as redemption!! This is, hands, feet and all limbs down, the best sandwich I've ever had. We have had several suggestions with and without the help of Yelp for places to eat and try from our friends since moving to SF about a month ago, and this place is the only place that has superceded its hype! I got the MILF, Husband got the Barry B and our guest got the I'm a Vegetarian Sometimes with mozarella sticks! The options are endless, the portions are huge and the prices are fair. You could easily turn this into two meals pending on how soggy bread gets with the divine dirty sauce (I'm picky about soggy bread). We all got the dutch crunch, which I will probably never stray from it was SO good. Ike definitely made the place so personable, giving us the time of day as our friend visiting loudly questioned whether or not it was really him. He didn't discount us as annoying crazies and stopped to talk to us about his expansion plans and was so genuine. He delivers the freshly made sandwiches to patrons and even allows them to wait in their car offering to bring their sandwiches to them when they were ready. It's great to see such a highly touted place still have a rootsy feel. I wonder how long it would take me to try every combination of every sandwich starting today....thinking about it makes me hungry.
Yum!! Sandwich was so moist and tasty and scrumptious. Ate the CABLT (California Avocado Bacon Lettuce Tomato) and grabbed a milkshake, too. Late lunch goodness!!
ikes place is right around the corner, i am so thankful for having this great food so close. they should get them a cool 100 points on the health departments score, but 90 works for me. eat here if you haven't, eat here more if you do...you guys would lay down some heavy competition, say you open one in palm springs?
I like Ike's place.
Ike's sandwiches are so yummy! Also, Ike is the coolest guy ever! Ike whatever do you put in my sandwich that makes it so delicious? I also enjoyed the Chai! Thanks for the yummy food and drink Ike!
The Meatless Mike's meatball sandwich is friggin' awesome. Great treat for vegans since I have never encountered a good vegan meatball sandwich anywhere. The marinara sauce is delicious as well as the vegan cheese. Check this place out for sure.
I wasn't even craving a sandwich but I had to try this place since it's so close to my apt. It was dinner time and I had been trying to decide which sandwich to get all day at work on their website. They have so many sandwich choices with very original and fun names. It was around 6:30pm and there were still quite a few people eating their sandwiches outside and also others waiting for their orders. I went with the Nacho Boy sandwich which consisted of hot roast beef, avocado, swiss and mushrooms. I like all of those ingredients so I didn't think it could be anything but yummy. And I was right! I had to wait about 10 minutes for it but that's not too long because it was sooo tasty. The cheese was perfectly melted into the rest of the layers, the roast beef wasn't too thick and I actually do like that. A lot of places just give you lots of meat to keep you happy but if it doesn't taste good, what's the point? I don't want a mouth full of meat especially when I'm eating a sandwich. I want all the layers to coexist, just like at Ike's from the soft and toasted bread to the melting cheese, fresh tomato and lettuce, and flavorful roast beef. I also ordered a side of fries and though it wasn't fried in greasy oil (the way I usually want it), it was still very flavorful and seasoned, a tad bit spicy and delicious with the ranch dressing.
What can I say Ike's is the BEST!! I use to eat here a lot when I worked close by and loved every sandwich that I have gotten but my all time fave. is M.I.L.F.. You have to try this place you cant go wrong with any of their sandwiches.
Earlier this year when I was in SF to visit family, a friend introduced me to Ike's. OMG, this place is certainly worthy of all the good reviews. I would eat the meatless meatball sandwich every day if I could. SOO good. I love you, Ike!
THEY HAVE ONE IN REDWOOD SHORES TOO, so need to go all the way to sf for the bombest sandwiches.
Here to post another review after my first time trying Ike's...So the first time I went in there, it blew me away and the sandwich was SUPER GREAT. So I went here the 2nd time and ordered the same sandwich but got absolutely terrible service! Ike-- PLEASE HIRE PEOPLE WHO ARE CUSTOMER FRIENDLY. I wwas going to order 2 sandwiches and a salad, and began telling the cashier that I wanted a salad. The cashier interrupts me and tells me-- "We're not reallly known for our salads and I think you should try getting a sandwich because that's what everyone comes here for." FIRST OFF, I was already planning to order a sandwich but just because I chose to order my salad first doesn't mean you have to tell me what to order! Jeez, plain RUDE! So I order the salad, my sandwich, and my boyfriends tells the cashier that he wants "The 16th and Market sandwich" (or some sandwich with the word market in there) and the cashier again interrupts, and says, "I wouldn't recommend that one, people don't usually order that. Why don't you try something else?" My boyfriend and I were both in awe, because we came to Ike's to order what WE WANTED not what other people usually order, or what the cashier tells us to order. I mean if yo u're going to have a billion sandwiches to choose from, why can't we order what we want? If we wanted a suggestion, we would ask. SO in end, Ike's still has great sandwiches but has a few crappy employees. Get new ones Ike.
We went here on the day it closed. We drove by - saw the line and said that place has to be good. After a two hour wait two out of three of our sandwches were wrong. They were very good - don't get me wrong, but to wait two hours and get the wrong thing was very disappointing. Also, I do not understand why it takes two hours. Yes, the line was long, but it wasn't that long. I do not get the two hour wait. I loved my sandwich, but it is not worth a two hour wait. I realize they have call ins too, but still we saw people come and go and there was just not that many people. The newspaper ad telling about their closing was on the front taped up and in it he said he employees 47 people - so why does it take so long.
this place is average...not worth the line...shocked at the high recommendations
We waited almost 2 hrs for our sandwiches. Over all the foods is ok but I don't think is worth to wait for an hour. You can find a lot of the sandwiches shop in SF can give you better sandwiches without waiting more than 15mins.
Awesome sandwiches. The dirty sauce makes the bread kind of taste like garlic bread since it is put on the bread before toasting. Calling ahead of time is a must. You can skip ahead of the line to go to the cashier to pick it up when it is ready. There's no place to sit though, so I'm docking half a star. Dolores Park is only a few blocks away, but the sandwich isn't always so hot once you get there. This is the only place I've ever spent $30 for a lunch that consisted of two sandwiches, large fries, and two bottles drinks, which is kind of pricey, so I'm going to take off another half a star.
Ike's Place is so Yum! I went there for the first time with a few folks a couple months back after hearing a lot of my friends rave about it all the time so I decided to give it a try. I got the "menage a trois" and it was gooood! It was a sweet sandwich filled with chicken breast, honey mustard, honey, and 3 different types of cheeses. My bf got the "king koopa" which had so much stuff in it i cant remember it all, but i know it did have jalapeno poppers and mozzarella sticks. The only reason why i'm giving it a 4 is because of the horrible parking and it's a long wait, but it's worth it! Also, what helps with the wait is the very friendly and outgoing host who takes your orders. The overall atmosphere is very welcoming as well. They have music playing in the kitchen and all the workers seem to be having a blast while making sandwiches, which was also fun to watch lol. I have yet to go back and try more of their delicious sandwiches!
IKEs place makes one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. I got "the name of the girl I'm dating" and the chicken breast was shredded so that it could get maximum gooey honey mustard coverage. The mix between the cheese, the honey mustard and pickles was amazing. Yum! It was definitely worth the wait.
Close Ike's and we riot.
It's too good to be true.
The best of the best! The Mnage  trois is INCREDIBLE. The fact that Ike himself comes out and hands you your sandwiches with a smile on his face is equally amazing to me and all the more reason to go there over and over again!
Tastes delicious but expect a nasty after taste of tummy ache and nausea. Either it was the choice of sandwich ( #40) or the amount of wetness in their sandwiches.
Ike's place. My friends have been telling me for years how good this place is. I finally went to try it out and yeah, its pretty dam good. I went in the morning so there was no line (thank goodness). From what i hear, the line can go up to an hour or two wait! I gave this place 4 stars as to 5 mainly because of price and taste (and some people might add the wait time). The price for a sandwich is 10bucks! A sandwich is just a sandwich. What makes it different was the "dirty sauce", which would've been better if they added a little more (the pickles overpowered the taste a bit). So to me, it is as if i paid 10bucks for sauce on a regular sandwich. Overall, I think this would be a great place for people who never had it. I would come back for this, but definitely not often.
It would be perfect if you didn't have to go to Lime. Yikes!
grrrrrreat!!!!!!
word to owner------i love you guys and the sandwiches are amazing! but the past 3 times iv gone there , you have been out of avocado which is not cool! it is a must have!!!!! as i waited for my sandwich, i heard the cashier tell 6 ppl you didnt have avocado! safeways sells 2 avocados for 1$ --- that 3 $ profit you lost out on in less then 5 minutes!!!! im only telling you this bc my family owns a resturant in noe valley and i hate it when we are out of stuff!!!!!!
sandwiches are like no other ... menu is very creative .. the sauce and bread cannot be replaced by any other sandwhich joint .. what sucks is there's always a long line .. I live across the street and because there is not a dining in area, we always find trash and food from ike's littering our neighborhood .. it is recommended to call in your order because when u pick it up, u don't have to wait in line .. but be prepared to be told your phone order will be ready in 2-3 hours .. suggestion: hire more people to assist in speeding up the line & maybe we'll go more often .. or .. relocate to s bigger location ...
Like a modern day Prometheus-- Ike has pilfered the recipe for the perfect reuben sandwich, and, in his ultimate graciousness, he has brought this joy down to 16th street and made it available to all for a reasonable seven dollars. Ike! You are the ultimate creator of the BLT, the weaver of meatball sub magic, and the king of the kingdom of pastrami. I eat here as often as my arteries can handle. Best sandwiches in the city.
This is by far the BEST sandwich shop I've ever been to. Upon my arrival to San Francisco I was told by friends that Ike's was a must on the first day of my trip. I thought to myself it's a sandwich shop how good can it be? The menu at Ike's is extensive and of course they have great veg sandwiches. I'm from D.C and places like Ike's don't exist in the District. I had the veggie Thanksgiving sandwich and it was incredible. If I lived in San Fran I would plan my day around getting a sandwich for lunch from Ike's. I know it sounds rediculous but a sandwich shop can really be that good.
i had fun ordering and eating my sandwich. i want another one just thinking about the one i ate earlier. the employees were entertaining, i think i even saw one get in an argument with a tub of mushrooms, and other customers were worthy of posting a craigslist missed connection, if you know what i'm saying.
I have been heading to Ikes whenever my schedule allows, from the moment he opened. These sandwiches are an incredible taste experience, and probably the best range of high protein (filling) vegetarian options I know of!! Have lost count of the number of friends that are now dedicated regulars. And am looking forward to the new shop in Berkeley.... and look out for the "Meatless Mike" - that would be ME :)
The Legend of Zelda and The Napoleon Complex were amazing! Quality ingredients make for a delicious sandwich. The sandwiches make for generous portions, so they are well worth the money.
after seeing ike's place on man vs. food i tried for months to convince friends to go with me and taste what appeared to look like heaven on tv. Finally after months...i finally get a weekend off, fly in from socal, head w/ my best friend directly to ike's. It wasn't hard to find because there was a line of 50 people along a building. With my palms sweating w/ anxiety I rushed to stand in line. 10 mins pass......30 mins pass.....1 hr passes......finally after an eternity we get to the door and place our order. I tried the menage a trios (or whatever) and the juicy bursting flavors overwhelmed me....i had to sit down. The next bite made me want to slap my friend and cry at the same time from sheer joy. Need i go on? I've tried millions of sandwiches but none tastier then ike's.  I'd give a 5 star rating but the dreadfully long line makes it almost not worth the wait. (note i said "almost")
The best sandwich I have every eaten. The second best Hamburger. I just went an hour out of my way to go there when I was in SF last.
WTF? This place is like the emperor's clothes - tell 'em it's great and they will believe it, plus not much there. No bathroom, no sitting or waiting area (warning signs not to block sidewalk or eat on neighbor's property) and $12 for a sandwich? Don't be fooled by the long roll or the mound of lettuce, there really isn't much else to it. The "grilled vegetables" were a few thin slices of mushrooms and onions; the meat and cheese pretty skimpy. Like another reviewer said - it's not a bad sandwich - just not great enough to wait in line for - thankfully, I didn't. And it certainly was not worth the price, either.
When I went, they didn't have avocado, so the sandwich I wanted wasn't available. Since I didn't feel like re-reading the whole menu for a substitute, I just settled for a Polish "dog" with cheese and a little mustard. It took a while, but the result was surprisingly good. In addition to melting the cheese well, I think they buttered the roll.
Best sandwiches in the city!
get the Milf! best sandwich ever and yes, me being the foodie that i am, i will wait in line just to have a sandwich. they really are that good!i think its ridiculous that they were contemplating shutting down the place because neighbors were complaining!! that is blasphemous. i lived away from they bay area for a couple years and when i discovered ikes during one of my trips up, it became a regular place to go to everytime i came up to the Bay. love it!if you are ordering to pick up during lunch or dinner time, i recommend calling in advance (maybe even an hour or two earlier) as they get really backed up with orders!
I went on a Friday at around 3pm. From waiting in line til I received my sandwich was a good 35-40 minutes. I had the Papa Sam. MMmmmmMMMMmm good! I actually wanted to order like 4-5 more sandwiches but then i would've never been able to finish them all by myself for the remainder of my trip. Ike was the one bringing out all the orders and he was so cute dressed in a pink button down shirt, vest and slacks :)
If you can stand the wait (or just call ahead) you'll be rewarded with a great sandwich.
Saturday night and we waited 35 mins just to order our food....heaven for vegetarian people...we tried Jessica's rabbit and Bowzer...both of them were excellent....best sandwiches in bay area :)
One of the best meatball sandwiches I've ever had... which is really saying something when:1. It was, in fact: ia MEATLESS Sandwich- Mike's Meatless Meatball (that makes it just 'Mike's Ball' then, right? Anyway, that one.) and2. I'm a Jersey Italian- Meatballs at dinner were like sprinkles on ice cream Big...delicious.. sauce covered...sprinkles. Mm mm.So take that for what you will. *Tip to the fellow east coaster- Try to resist the urge to "hold" any of the fixins because they 'don't do that in NY.' Be brave and get it "with everything." Truly, it's worth the risk.
This place is awesome, sandwiches are super tasty and the staff is super friendly. I now have 2 favorite sandwich spots in SF Ike's and Roxie's.
Outstanding. Long line, but good Nuff said.
Ike is my husband's new hero. He is more of a sandwich fan than I am, so I am giving Ike's the 5-star rating for my husband. I'm more of a simple salami-mayo-and-lettuce type of gal, while my husband loves the sandwiches that are so loaded that you can't fit it all in your mouth. I didn't want to order an "unoriginal" sandwich, so I went for the Eli Manning (chicken breast, mushrooms, garlic sauce on sourdough - i skipped the avocado), and my husband got the Matt Cain, which I think had a ton of meat with veggies thrown in there, on Dutch Crunch. (The girl who took our order was patient enough to list off the types of breads they have, and even suggested which ones went well with the sandwiches we chose. So nice!) Loved the bread and sauces - and the meat was delish, too. Good quality stuff. We had to wait about 20 minutes in line and for the sandwich - not too bad. Enjoyed a sunny SF day eating lunch at Dolores Park, but had to fight off pigeons who wanted a taste of Ike's too. :P
The appointment thing is kind of bullshit! (I mean you're a sandwich shop!) But what a great sandwich! Simply put: If you're in the mood for a delicious sandwich, you must go here! They are very slow, but it well worth the wait!
a couple friends and i decided to take a bike ride around the city and ended up at ike's for a sandwich because we'd heard it was SO good! we'd planned to take it to dolores park to eat but ended up waiting an HOUR!!! the sandwich was good but i don't know if i'd wait another hour next time! it was a good thing it was a nice day that day, it was actually warm in the city, but even that didn't help the fact that we were starving and waiting an eternity for a sandwich.
had name of girl im dating and nacho boymake sure you eat them stat as they are warm and cozy and will melt in your mouth not like ice cream but like hot cheese or somethingmuch better than subway and worth it. name of girl im dating was a bit oily however, still good.
OMG! I had the best sandwich ever! I got "Cristina and Umair go to Ike's Place" on French bread and it was DELICIOUS! I went during lunch time on Saturday and from reading all the reviews on Yelp, I knew I had to call in. I called in my order at 12:30 and was told it would be ready at 2:20. WOW, I didn't expect it to take THAT long. But, there were other things to do beforehand. First it took an hour to find parking, (it was terrible). But when I walked up to pick up my sandwiches, Ike personally handed me my sandwich and thanked me for calling in. (The line outline was CRAZY). The 2 hour wait was so worth it because the sandwich was AMAZING, I even got a caramel apple lollipop ;). I couldn't stop telling people about my experience at Ike's. This was my first time at Ike's, I saw it on Man Vs. Food. Thanks to that show, I will be at Ike's every Saturday for lunch =)
So, hubby and I were in the city last Sunday and decided to try this place based on the killer Yelp reviews. It was past 230 pm but there was still a long queue at the door, which seemed par for the kind of reviews this place has. We stand in line for about 20 minutes and finally get to the counter. Yay! The lady behind the counter is super nice - doesn't rush us despite the long queue of people behind us, chats about this and that, and also mentions in passing that one of the ovens is broken as an explanation to why she can't do fries (or was it onion rings?)So, anyway...we place our order and start waiting for our sandwich. We had read some of the yelp reviews, plus the place looked really crowded - so we were prepared for a longish 15-20 minute wait for our sandwich. When we had already been waiting for more than 30 minutes, I remarked to my husband "No sandwich can be worth this." And then in the same breath added - "Maybe this one will be".Well, our sandwiches finally made it to us after 45+ minutes of placing the order and I am sad to report that they weren't worth the wait :(Don't get me wrong - it was a really nice sandwich. It just wasn't great enough to justify more than an hour of waiting (20 mins to order + 45 mins to get the food).The worst part is that when we placed the order, there was no mention of how long the wait might be, in which case 1) we would have been prepared for it and 2) we could have chosen to go elsewhere.Also, there was no apology for the long wait when the sandwich was finally served to us.I suppose having 4.5 stars after 700+ reviews has a way of making you arrogant :(
Really good place to eat. The sandiwches are hot and meaty and there's so much to choose from!! I was there the other day and I guess they're not serving french fries anymore because some genius decided to order hella fries and sandwiches (@ 15 fries & 15 sandwiches). It took them forever to make the order so I guess after that they are only making sandwiches...no more fries =(
This place is sooo worth the wait. Some of the best sandwiches in the city. If I could, I would eat here everyday. First time I tried it, I got the MILF..... I cant really describe what happens when you try their food. Its an experience to say the least.... DEF try it.
The sandwich was very good. The people were great. The wait was too long. Uggh.
delicious! too much on the menu, i didn't even know what to order! they have real coke too, ones made out of sugar cane! try it with their sandwich. yumm...
Maybe it's because I'm from the east coast where we have hoagie shops all over but I was not impressed here. Luckily there was not a long line that day which I often see, b/c I definitely don't feel it's worth the wait.
i probably cant add more than what has been said about this place -- but came here with a friend and had the [name of your girlfriend] sandwich......AND IT WAS AMAZING! seriously, melt in your mouth goodness! the sandwich had this savory chicken mix going on & their dirty sauce in it. they had run out of avocados, so we replaced it with mushrooms - not their usual request they told us, but it worked! they even give you a caramel/apple lollipop to top it off! SO GOOD and will definitely be back!
I would have a menagetrois with a matt cain any day! Food was delicious. I can see why the menage is so popular.. its AMAZING and i dont even like bbq or honey mustard that much! I figured i would try it since everyone says its delicious and I was not disappointed. The matt cain was very good as well. I think the godfather sauce on this makes is so delicious. Four stars because I also ordered the King Koopa (which I had HIGH hopes for) and was only midly impressed, That could be because by the time I ate it it was already cold :/
Rain or shine you will stand in line, but the sandwiches don't come any better! What is in the "dirty sauce" anyway? It's addictive...YUM!
Fantastic sandwich place with a never ending menu. Call ahead to save yourself the obligatory 30 minute wait.
Yummy! I got the Elvis chicken teriyaki (#1) and my bf got the veggie version (#11). We both LOVED the sandwiches and look forward to trying others. Ike was very nice. Definitely recommend calling ahead. Minus one star because a bit pricey.
mr pickles!
this place totally kicks ass. with its dirty sauce and deliciously, not-so-healthy sandwich fillings, you're right ike, this ain't my momma's sandwich shop. the call-in wait is super long, but works out perfect when you have a craving, you're on the other side of town and need to muni it over.and BIG kudos for the hottie that works the register. ka-CHING!
Ike's is a sandwhich shoppe by dolores park. I had a custom sammich. Roast beef and veggies. On a roll type i was unfamiliar with but was their most populat choice for a roll. I also got a rootbeer. Total came out to 10 bucks. Not a bad price for sf. Sammich not quite big enough to be two meals on its own. The roast beef was fully cooked to well done which made me sad. It was thin enough that it wasnt chewy though which is good. The veggies were regular, tomato was pink, not red and jalapenos were not fresh. I added bacon but couldnt really taste it in the sandwhich. The staff was very upbeat and friendly. The breadchoice and sauce they use made it very reminiscent of a cuban sammich. If i had wanted a cuban i would have been very content with it. But, unfortunately it didnt really satisfy the roast beef craving i had. I give it a 3, a 4 if u want a cuban. If I was big on sandwhiches i'd probably go again but I'm an asian food junkie, so take my views with a grain of salt. My pallatte for this type of food is limited
wow! the best sandwich's in the city by far. my girlfriend and i went there last weekend and waited an hour in line. they have a great selection of vegan and vegetarian sandwich's. the dutch crunch is a must and the dirty sauce is off the hook. well worth waiting in line. the workers are real cool too. great service.
I've been here 3 times in the past 2 weeks. I live just a few buildings away. I have to say that the food is very reasonably priced and tasty. Ike has certainly put a lot of thought and effort into this place. Ike and the staff always have a smile and welcome you every time. Good guy & good food. I'd give this place a 5 rating if there were more places to sit. The place has good energy. It would be great if there were more seating. I hope it catches on so Ike expand this cool establishment.
My work had ordered a bunch of sandwiches for lunch one day. My coworker and I went to go pick it up. The place was pretty cramped and didn't look too clean. The mailman came to drop off some mail, and the guy making the sandwiches grabbed the mail from him while he was making a sandwich [I think it was mine too! eeeek!!] He was wearing gloves while touching all the food and then grabbed the mail with the same glove. Then went right back to making the sandwich without changing gloves or washing his hand!!! That was not cool. I tried to look past that because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I thought, "Hey if the sandwich is as great as everyone says it is, I guess it's ok." Ike's received so many great reviews! The sandwich was ok. I guess I don't see why everyone is raving about it. I do think it is cool that they have such a wide variety to choose from with cool names for each sandwich too. Sorry, I don't know if I'll be making a trip here again. Maybe if I'm in the area, I might. Most probably not tho.
my sandwich was delicious (i think it was the menage e tois) and my friend's "barry z" was also great. the boy who took our order was too cute though. im trying to be an independent single lady and i really don't need boys that attractive popping up before ive even had my sandwich.
got the veggie BLT and the meatless meatball sub and it was heaven. they are both excellent sandwiches. I would say the meatless meatball sub is better than a real meatball sub, but I haven't had meat in about a year. You ROCK the fake meat Ike.
The Sandwiches were awesome. I tried the 'Hot date' sandwich. It was very good. The team behind the counter is very friendly too. Just that I am not sure if the 30 minute wait during non lunh hours was worth it. Will I go there again? probably yes, will try to keep the time thing in mind.I think the best thing to do would be to order and pick up later. But what if you want a good sandwich right then?
oh ikes... ive been frequenting ikes for about two years now, and even with it evolving over the past year into what it is now, its kept a solid foothold in my sandwich deciding factor. Basically anything you get is going to be good. if you eat meat, u could accidentally get a veggie sandwich and not mind/even know that it was vegetarian. as for the vice versa, vegetarians probably would be able to tell, but who cares about that. these days it has been kind of a love to hate relationship. the wait times are ever getting longer and longer, the phone orders are surprisingly longer then expected. which is the only reason i am giving ikes four stars instead of five. sorry ike, i dont know three hours in advance if im going to want a sandwich or not, im more of a spontaneous sandwich eater, but i did hear a rumor they are looking to open another location, in which case, i will hook you guys up with that extra star.
I phone my order in, and it's always ready when they say. Tastes great, and not too expensive for SF.
the best in sf!
The reviews are in, Ike's really is all that. I can't think of a better sandwich shop. If that doesn't qualify it as 5 stars, I don't know what would.
When I heard everyone going on about Ike's I was like "it's a sandwich place, how good can it be?". All I can say is every day for the past week since I tried my first Ikes sandwich I've been craving more. This is one of the truly rare places that lives up to the hype. Best sandwiches I've ever had, no question!
For the most part, it lives up to the hype. If I had to have a sandwich, this would be the place to go. The owner was incredibly nice and clearly into what he's doing.
Darn good and was actually worth the wait! Best part was at the end when I was totally stuffed there was the caramel apple lollipop to put me completely over the edge.
Its almost unfortunate that this place is as good as it is. Its like the Connor Oberst-esque feeling of dissapointment that it lives up to the hype, because, quite frankly it just is that good. This is probably the second best sandwich I've ever had in my life. If I could only remember the name of it. They have the second best name for a sandwiches I've ever seen( first being that which is in Curb Your Enthusiasm, where the name um after the celeberties and he gets the bad one and tries to trade...but i digress). They have adorably cute names such as: the ex-girlfriend, or 24th and Mission and cooky crazy adorable shit like that, that just makes you want to vommit but in such a good way. Their sandwiches are cooked to perfection, Ikes bald beautiful head is always there to serve you, he's essentially the Jesus of sandwiches. Really he figured it out, hes either the Jesus of sandwiches or sold his soul to the devil for supreme knowledge of all that is sandwich. Anyway their air-fries are bomb. They have a pretty good selection of soda, not amazing, but good enough, I mean really a Coke in the bottle is all I really need. Oh ya and they give you a lollipop with your sandwich(fake British accent), BLAM! Are you still there or did your head explode because you realized your an idiot having not tried these sandwiches yet, why the fuck are you still reading this GO, GO NOW! In all seriousness, its little adorable awesome-as-fuck gems like this that make San Francisco the place that it is. Thank you Ike, for your place.
Vegan goodness, despite the lines!
simply the best sandwich in town
They made the best sandwiches I have had in my life. People who work there are super nice. Have many great choices to choose from. I ordered SF Giants on Dutch Crunch, and it was phenomenal. Totally recommend everyone to pay a visit.
Whoa. Lemme tell you - there is nothing better than "Going Home for Thanksgiving"
hands down, ike's beats bay cities in santa monica. if youve had bay cities before, you know this is no small feat.
I've only had, so far, the sandwich known as The Pride of the Castro which is ham, turkey and brie. I chose to have it on a french roll with everything but pepperocini. It was marvelous. I am not from California. I have lived several places, but throughout my life I have subsisted mainly on sandwiches. I love sandwiches. And I loved this sandwich from Ike's Place. I intend to go back and try all of my favorites - they have an extensive selection, including breakfast sandwiches (my beloved egg & cheese on a roll for instance) served all day. yay!The people working there were really friendly without being overbearing at all - it's important to me. In fact, the fellow making my sandwich offered to put some avacado on to improve the sandwich even more. Being a weirdo purist when it comes to sandwiches, I declined. But that was totally nice of him!Ok, everyone here who is raving about this place is right right right. A cute little place, they even have some tables set outside.
Ohhh my!! There's a new sandwich in town... and his name is Ike. I tried this place based on the Yelp reviews I saw. I'm new to SF and I think its a great sandwich / deli town and this place surely belongs on the best of list.  My husband was not keen on going because the place was categorized "Vegan" or "Vegetarian" ... so if that's not your bag, baby, don't let it put you off. There are tons of selections involving meat or not. I took a while to check out the huge variety of sammys on the menu and was served by the super friendly girl behind the counter. I got what she told me was the most popular menu item, and of course the name escapes me now. But it was delicious!  What I loved is the fact that the sandwich creations are so unique, resulting in a "I've never tasted a sandwich like this before" response. There's really only so much you can do with a sandwich and Ike has broken new ground. I can't compare them to anywhere else, it's just kind of a combo of all the best stuff I've ever seen in the art of sandwich making. Toasted, chock full of high quality toppings, and with a yummy special sauce. My husband loved his too. His only complaint was that he wished it was bigger because it was sooooo tasty. As many have said, the seating is very limited, so we took the food to go. My only complaint is that Ike has now complicated our decision when it comes to where to have lunch. So many sandwiches that we are going to need to try. I have to stop finding good restaurants in this town or I'm going to turn into a moose. Great food, great staff, great prices, great selection. Try this place folks.
Hands Down... Best sandwiches I've ever had. I live a block away from Ike's and despite of the long line, it is worth the wait.  And if you don't feel like waiting in line, call it in and they will have it ready for you. DELICIOUS!
I've been in the neighborhood a while, Ike. The place where you built your shop used to be an ice cream shop. I remember they were open during the winter last year, then went on vacation for the summer. I knew they wouldn't last long. Before them was what I can best describe as a "trinket shop" because it looked like their complete inventory was composed of those tiny toys you can buy in Safeway for a quarter out of the gumball machine things. A bunch of shit nobody needs, in other words. I didn't think they would go out of business. I was convinced that they were in there laundering money because how else could they possibly keep the lights on selling Hello Kitty stickers? But they did and you moved in. I like to think I was among your first few customers, but who knows. The Buffalo Chicken sandwich I took home made sex in my mouth and I've been a fan ever since. Then a few months later you came out with the air fries. I still think that fighter jets are the current height of human achievement, but the air fries are a close second. One day I'm gonna get my name up on that menu and all the hot babes that come along with the honor. Until then I'll just enjoy the food. A belated welcome to the neighborhood, Ike.
my bf and i showed up to the place expecting there to not be such a long line for some sandwiches.....but we were wrong. we waited 45-60 minutes just to order which kinda sucked. and we waited another 20-30 minutes after ordering to get our food. the workers are really friendly, nice and patient when asked questions. they all seem to enjoy working there which makes it a nicer environment to come to. i got something but i cant even remember the name because the sandwiches names are too ridiculous and long for me to remember, but what i got was good. it was a veggie sandwich with pesto, artichokes, avocado, tomatoes, provolone on a DUTCH roll. the dutch roll is GOOD. i think it was suppose to come with alfalfa sprouts but they were out :(were the sandwiches were worth the wait? yes.
My boyfriend and I went here earlier today, Sunday, after first phoning in our order and picking it up 45 minutes later. I have no complaints about that. They are a busy place, so if you don't feel like waiting, then go somewhere else or plan ahead. Geez.I got the Mr. Sanderson (Bacon, Mozzarella Sticks, Avocado), which is one of their more expensive sammies, at $10 without any add-ons. I figured there would be plenty of at least 2 of those ingredients. I also added BBQ for $1. I was very clear about what I wanted, and yet they still managed to put on tomato--gross--which comprised a good 25% of the goods between the bread. There were only 2 or 3 Mozzarella sticks, not much bacon, and an average amount of avocado. Not sure why my sandwich was so skimpy. Yes, it tasted good, but it was pretty small--especially compared to Roxie's. I will give them another chance, as they have some interesting sounding options and are reviewed so highly.I really recommend Roxie's though. I can't believe how much bacon and avocado they put on my turkey sandwich and how amazing and fresh it tasted. and good lord it was HUGE. Seriously, it is an insanely yummy good deal. and Roxie's on 9th ave is only 2 blocks from me =D
best sandwiches i've ever had, bar none. call ahead and avoid the line.
Really good sandwiches. I may upgrade this to five after a few more trips. I got the Barry B and added avocado, which apparently has it's own name, but I don't remember it -- I wasn't blown away, but it was very good. My roommate, on the other hand, ordered the Menage a Trois and declared it "The Best Sandwich I've Ever Had." My experience wasn't quite as memorable, but like I said, I may be upgrading after trying a few more sandwiches.
Pretty much the only complaint is that they're not open 24 hours, so I can satisfy a craving at any time. The sandwiches are fantastic. Not every sandwich will meet every person's taste, but there are so many choices and the guys there are so cool about adding whatever you want to a sandwich that everyone in your group will be happy.
damn good sandwich. they are also freakin huge!
Words can't even describe the deliciousness of Ike's sandwiches. The best FOOD I've ever had, period. I get the vegetarian Backstabber, subbing mushrooms for artichoke hearts, with extra caesar. So mouth-watering!
This is a review after two visits to Ike's. First one was the day before they moved out of the old place, the second visit was at Lime. Both times got Manage-a-Trois (#111). Since first time was the last day at the old location, half of SF (and Bay Area probably) had decided to go and have one last bite in case Ike 's permanently disappeared so the wait was close to 2hrs. But man once the sandwich arrived I was in heaven... For sure the best tasting sandwich I had tasted.... In retrospect however, i thought that maybe it seemed sooo good only because I had waited in the cold for 2hrs and almost passed out of hunger. So decided to give it another go. This time I PHONED IN and picked up the sandwich 20min later. No wait, no hassle... (was a bit confused that it was @ Lime) walked in and as i was paying the sandwich arrived. Again so damn good! The honey + dirty sauce + whatever else they put on that sandwich was so delicious... I wish I had ordered two instead of one... BEST SANDWICH EVER!
I love this place. I went here weeks ago and can't stop thinking about the next time I'll be in the Ike's Place neighborhood to stop in for a sandwich. I like the fact that they take reservations on weekends (for the time being) because I hate waiting in lines.  After reading all the Yelp hype about the place, I made a reservation for me & the boyfriend, went to the shop at my designated time, and without wait or pressure, we ordered the Backstabber Sandwich (Chicken Breast, Marinated Artichoke Hearts, Caeser Dressing, Provolone) and Hot Mama Huda (Frank's Red Hot Sauce, Chicken Breast, Ranch, Provolone). Each bite was a delicious flavour explosion, with all the ingredients working together as they should. The sandwiches are generously sized, so I was only able to eat half before getting full. I recommend taking the sandwiches to-go and eating them at nearby Dolores Park for an afternoon picnic lunch or sitting at Ike's outside sidewalk seating area, where the sun hits perfectly. This place is well worth going out of your way to for a sandwich.
Always passed by here on the way home but never thought it would be one of the best sandwich places in SF. Came here twice so far and waited about 20 min in line to order and 20 min to receive the order, but it was worth every min and I have to say I am in love with this place. Good size sandwiches for the price. So far I tried the Hot date for hire & the Joker and I got to say both were very very tasty, delicious, and one of the best subs I have ever tried in California and trust me I tried a lot places. I usually go to the Submarine center in West Portel or Gene's Liquar on Taravel. This place offers unusual subs that you can't find anywhere else. I also like the fact Ike brings out your order with a friendly smile and short chat. I give this place 4 stars and not 5 because there's always room for improvement but would have to say def in my top 5 list for sandwiches in California. Prepare for a satisfing messy meal if your really hungry and wanting a good sandwich because there's a lot of love they put into it. (Don't forget the Dirty sauce a must have)
Best sandwiches I've ever had. Wish I lived closer!
4 stars for a really tasty hamburger.an extra star goes to Ike. as i waited for my food, he gave a sandwich to a guy who clearly couldn't afford it on his own.
Amazing sandwiches. Ike helped cater my 2009 Christmas party and my guests went crazy for these delectable creations of goodness! Not to mention Ike himself, a great and super sweet guy who is hugely active and generous in supporting community organizations.
got the Chipper's Fave and it was pretty amazing. but I think what really did it for me was how nice the staff were.
one of the best turkey sandwiches ive had in my life. ive only been here once but i'll defintely go again. the customer service is awesome. the sandwich guys are super friendly and they chop it up with customers like their your bff. they are funny and get you excited about your sandwich just watching them work and being in their presence. the menu is huge and overwhelming, literally a book of sandwich descriptions. they give their creations these crazy names (cant think of any off the top of my head) that make you wonder why, but its still very very cool and makes this place one-of-a-kind.at certain times of the day, you can get a free drink and chips. they even threw in a free caramel apple lollipop in my brown bag which i thought was cute.only bad thing was parking. but its SF, so, that negative cancels out, and ike place is perfect in every way. the end.
when you see a swarm of people lingering outside a tiny little joint while it's africa hot in san francisco, you know the place has gotta be good! by far the tastiest sammy i have had in a long while! . . . i'm not exactly sure what the "dirty sauce" is but, it along with jalapenos make these sandwiches delicious - my mouth is watering for another one as i write this! definitely a MUST try spot on the city!
long wait but delish sammich. came based on recommendation of our friend. the bf and i really enjoyed the super mario. i should have gotten a 2nd order. oh wells, next time...
i've been hearing about this place for awhile and finally made my way down there today. i can't believe i've waited so long!! i can't wait to go back and work my way through each of the sandwiches. we were lucksy that the wait wasn't too long. we must have beat the rush, cause right after we ordered and sat, the line was out the door and to the sidewalk. but even though there were only a few people in front of us, it still took awhile to get the actual sandwiches, i guess it takes awhile to make a small piece of heaven! we got the super mario (beef meatballs, mozzarella sticks, marinara sauce) and eli manning (halal chicken, garlic/herb sauce, chedder, avocado). we split the sandwiches and although very different, they were both so good!! my only thing is that i wish the super mario had more sauce and that the mozzarella sticks were more gooey and melted. we were a little confused though because we'd read on the website that they bake their own bread, but when we got there, it was clearly store-bought bread, but i guess cause they toast it for you...? and it was a good thing we looked at the menu online first because not all the sandwiches are listed on the sandwich board, which seems weird. they don't seem to have a whole menu anywhere for you to look at. you would think with so many choices that they would have paper menus for you to look at while waiting, cause the wait is long and there are SO many options. so, i suggest looking online first, and maybe next time we'll call our order ahead as well. PLUS, we had seen something about fries in a yelp review, but no such thing listed once we got to ike's so we forgot to order them, not that we needed them cause we were SO full, but we saw another table that got them and they looked really good...ahhh, and to end such a superb meal, we went to bi-rite ice cream right nearby afterwards....needless to say, i feel like a fat cow now...
I love ike's but can only give it four stars because the last time we went there, they were out of all bread except for two kinds wheat and sourdough which was fine.. but then they were also out of avocado which i may also have over looked except the counter boy said that he would just go ahead and sub cucumber! cucumber, like the cold round veggie can replace avocado and then he looked as us like we were the douches for not thinking that cucumber is a fair and obvious swap for avocado. we left with out any thing and walked to the mission for burritos instead. to be fair i have never gone to ike's without there being at least one thing they are out of, and it is soooo yummy i will go back again and again and tell my friends..
I'm SO glad I stopped by Ike's; for a place that looks like a hole-in-the-wall, they serve some incredible sandwiches. Hot and tasty, on a nice soft french roll, loaded with real chicken breast (not that deli sliced crap) and huge slices of avocado and all the regular sandwich fixin's. Service is fast and friendly and I'll definitely go back.The prices are more than reasonable for the quality and they have a ton of sandwich choices. If you don't like the options on the menu, you can invent your own! Besides sandwiches, they also serve burgers (hamburger, turkey, salmon, veggie) and salads, and they have a selection of breakfast sandwiches, coffees, and ice cream.
Yum!!!! Their Say-Hey pastrami sandwich is great.
Why can't everyone make sandwiches that taste this good? I guess it's hard. Ike and his entire staff are wonderful people. With a place this incredibly busy, you might expect a staff that is terse, impatient, maybe even a bit rude. But in the case of Ike's, they treat each customer with kindness and respect, and patiently answer your questions. They seem to genuinely appreciate your business... Imagine that!
Sandwiches r really good.......but waitin over 2 hours (1.5 hrs to place order and another 40 mins to get the sandwiches) on a sunday.....i dunno bout u but it's a super long time to wait to eat a sandwich.
i love this place. i'm going to try all of the big 3. tried the doomsday a week ago, was spicy as hell but so delicious. the kryptonite is next then the lex luthor.
This place is mostly what it is made out to be. Innovative sandwiches, an interested staff, and mighty tasty! Sandwiches ought to be on toasted yet soft bread, and neither quiznos nor subway will ever get there.
GREAT lunch for a beautiful vacation day in SF! i had the '(name of your girlfriend)' and it was pretty awesome....worth the 30 minute wait! they could definitely use some benches or tables to sit at and wait...you either have to stand for long periods of times or risk sitting on the ground where who-knows-what has been spilled/dropped/puked/etc there before! but the food was great...FRIENDLY staff working their arse's off...and the few girls that work there were cute too! haha not that that matters or has an effect on the food ;) but if i lived in SF i'd go there all the time!
finally! a fantastic sandwich place with tons of veggie options. try the veggie meatballs, they're like crack. crackballs.
Great sandwiches. Call ahead and pick up your order there is really nowhere to sit. I got there early only five people in line ahead of me,it still took about twenty minutes to get my food.No parking either.
a hell of a good sandwich, mediocre salad (buffalo wing salad was dry and basic) and a hell of a wait. an hour at 1pm is a bit much
amazing. you don't need to read the 800 reviews. just go!
Awesome find on yelp! We like to find places to visit off the beaten path from the normal touristy traps when visiting other cities and this was a GREAT find. A great way to get to another part of the city, and a great lunch! One of the best sandwiches EVER. We got a couple and shared to have the best of both worlds! Definitely recommend.
Love it...If you like this you might also want to try Mr.Pickle's Sandwiches in the mission
yum. worth the hour wait in freezing cold weather. Best sandwiches around. As a vegan, I had hella options.
what can be said about ike's that hasn't already been said.....where else ya gonna get a 'vegan tony soprano'...........satriale's would be proud.
words escape me. i am too overwhelmed with love for this place to know how to describe them. amazing. amazing amazing amazing.
I feel really sorry for Ike, he's busting his ass making sandwiches that taste like awesome and there are Yelpers out there complaining that the sandwiches are too messy! Messy!? Man, you guys are GRADE A pansies. Sandwiches are the meal of the common man and they are supposed to be messy. I dare yallz to check out my tie collection, each has been stained by the awesomeness of Ike's Place! Its like a Boy Scout Badge of Honor! Now on to the review. I'm at a loss at how a reservation would work at this place, but luckily for me I usually get a sandwich in the weekday. There's still a line around lunch time but the 30 min wait is worth it. If its sunny, just bring out a chair and chill outside. Have a smoke, or talk to a friend. Patience is the key. I have tried the "Name of Girlfriend" Sandiwich, the Backstabber, and the "We're Just Friends". I always get Dutch Crunch because that is the bread of Kings. I definately recomend the We're Just Friends due to the Orange Glaze, Many will balk at the messines but man up and get dirty! Haven't got a chance to try the milkshakes but if I ever do, I'm sure to make sure Daniel Day Lewis isn't around when I drink it!
Hands down the best place to get a sandwich in the city... If you're willing to wait. I advise calling ahead for pick up, which is usually at least an hour. But, I have never been disappointed and it has always been well worth the wait. Thank you Ike's for being so delicious!
I may be the worlds pickiest eater, "yes more of that...no none of that..remove this" but Ike's always gets it right. I was a little upset that my little secret was out on Man vs Food so now its impossible to get in for my favorite sandwich. This is totally a 5!
best.effing.sandwich.ever.
Awesome awesome awesome. Best sandwiches I ever had.
The sandwiches were extremely delicous, HOWEVER the kitchen was filthy. They were just a bunch of teenagers (5, maybe 6) and they just slapped whatever on a piece of bread. If your looking for fancy smanscy, fork and knife lunch, this is not the place to go AT ALL.
I don't get the hype about this place... I went to get me a big sandwich cuz everyone was tellin me how great this place is n they supposedly be makin huge sandwiches where its more than enough for one person. Well, I asked the host to give a big sandwich cuz I'm hungry, he charged me for #8 with cheesesticks n my friend orders #1 with extra meat, extra cheese, nd cheesesticks. N they included 2 bottles of water with 2 bags of chips. My total came to $36 n some change. I don't know what the hell they charged me for but I didn't say anything thinking our sandwiches are gonna be huge... Well, 1st my sandwich was bigger than my friends with all the extras in his sandwich. 2nd my sandwich wasn't even big... I didn't find any better than a #8 toasted from ToGo's! I will not go to this place again... If I do, it be to ask for my money from last visit! Btw, I'm 180 pounds n 5ft n 11inchesm so no I'm not some fatass who cries about food... I went there cuz I wanted "great' sandwiches n left with regrets!
I walked in with my b/f for lunch and the food was AWESOME. The sandwiches were huge and I was hungry so it worked out great. I will be coming back for sure the next time I'm in the area!
yay ike!!
if i had to pick a number, it would have to be 40! being from the south, i can truly appreciate the genius of putting a chicken fried steak in a sandwich and i haven't found a good enough reason to deviate from the deliciousness of the 40!my very first sandwich at ikes was the super mario (but only cause i didn't know about the 40 til i saw it on their online menu) which is pretty much a super tasty mess! haha be prepared with LOTS of napkins! seriously, fried mozzarella sticks in a sandwich - where does he come up with these amazing ideas?!the only "bad" thing about ikes is that i can't have it every single day. it's one of those places you think about when you ask yourself, "what's the one thing that could make me happy today?" :)
This place ROCKS! With all the great reviews I was very skeptical. I wondered if Ike had written them all himself. Ike is a true sandwich artist--in the sense that he put together ingredience that added up to one AMAZING sandwich. I was disappointed that I went back on a Thurs and it was closed. Ike--when are you opening one in Seattle???
i freaking love this place. i live in los angeles but travel up to san francisco to party/ meet friends up every now and then... and let me tell you this place has sandwiches on a whole other level than any sandwich i've ever encountered. Now i know what you're thinking, " how good could a sandwich be? " right? WRONG!@ their sandwiches are simply amazing, i've tried about 4 or 5 of their sandwiches now and i've LOVED everyone of them. One time i went i ordered my favorite sandwich the "ex-boyfriend" and the lady quickly ran out and told me they didn't have the ingredients they needed to make my sandwich so i simply told her to surprise me. Later on when i came back to pick up my sandwich, she had picked me a sandwich which the name of escapes me right now. but it was a turkey sandwich. Usually i'm not a big fan of turkey... but i absofreaking-LOVED it. Service ALWAYS comes with a smile, everytime i go there they always are happy and jolly. i DEFINATELY recommend this place to everyone. I sometimes crave it so i'll plan out trips to SF just to get a sandwich. i'll buy 2 so i can eat one on the way back too. =) no joke.
Lived up to the hype. I got the "name of girl I'm dating" and loved it. I could only eat half but it was fabulous. Order ahead--they give you a time estimate. have a back up place to sit in mind (like dolores park) if there's no room to sit outside. Get napkins, and don't even try to eat daintily.
yep. this place is super legit. i've been here 4 times now and i always leave dreaming about what delightful concoction i'm going to try next. service is A+.
hot dog! those are some huge sandwiches. yummy and wonderful. they make veg/vegan versions of many of them too. it is just too good. i need to go there again.
It is really as good as it can get. More than 90 awesome finger-lickin sandwiches to choose from and nice friendly staff. Will definitely be back.
Ike has cracked the code with these magical sandwiches. They really are something. Toasted and all saucy and stuff. Made me feel like a dream while I was eating my turkey and monterey jack on wheat. I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't been there.
Still the best sandwiches in the bay area, but today I was disappointed. I always want to share great food spots, this time I was with my son coming back from the airport. So, I phoned in our order and rolled by to pick up.  Got home to the East Bay to enjoy our sandwiches, but one, damn, one was missing a meat and both sandwiches were ordered no pickel or peppers (but there they were, UGH!) But more importantly, WHERE WAS THE DIRTY SAUCE!!!!!  It has always come with, never had to ask, this is what really makes the sandwiches unique. So, with 5 staff and no line as it was early, why oh why? I still love Ike's, today was just an off day, bummer.....
The sandwiches are ridiculously delicious, Ike and his staff are super friendly and the prices are reasonable. What can I say? This place lives up to all the hype, it is amazing!
absolutely brilliant. a menu after my own heart. i have such trouble ordering here. guess i should just go down the list. have tried only a handful so far and happy to live so close that i can keep going back. i highly recommend each one i've tried: the veggie meatball thing, the one with chicken and bacon and cheese, the nacho boy, the cheesesteak one, the burger...yum. i'm making myself hungry and i just had a big dinner! you can tell ike loves what he does, which is probably what makes it all such a pleasure for his customers.
ok, let's get real here. everyone for the most part loves a good sandwich, right??ike's is on a WHOLE other level. people who haven't rated this place at LEAST four stars are just anal. seriously. came in here in the mid-late afternoon on a sunday and waited nearly 40 mins to place my order and get my sandwich, and all i have to say is that it was DAMN WELL WORTH THE WAIT!!! my stomach is grumbling right now just thinking of the deliciousness that is ike's. after reading several positive reviews about the sandwiches here, i decided to give ike's a go and it did not disappoint. i ordered the menage a trois on dutch crunch, added with bacon and avocado, and it was nothing short of superb. honestly, this was the best sandwich i've ever had in my life. everything from the bread, the chicken, the blend of honey, bbq and honey mustard sauce and the three cheeses were just mouthwatering. another reason why i gave this place five stars is because everyone there works hard. i was surprised to see ike himself restocking chips and drinks and handing out completed orders while everyone else was doing their own tasks. it's good to see the owner of a place work hard because it shows they care. one of the guys there who makes sandwiches, alex, is a pretty chill dude, and the girl at the register, ya-el (i think i just butchered her name with that spelling) are great (and wow...does that girl have gorgeous eyes...if you ever read this i just want you to know that i have a mini-crush on you ya-el!!!) hahaha...anyways...seriously, if you haven't tried out ike's then make sure you do it soon. i'm definitely hitting this place up at LEAST once a week to try out all of their sandwiches (except maybe the vegan/vegetarian ones...i'm a carnivore, sorry PETA supporters;). HOORAY FOR IKE'S!!!!!
I decided to go to Ike's Sandwich for the first time last week on a day when it was pouring down rain. I called ahead for my sandwich so I wouldn't have to stand in line in the deluge. When I arrived, I asked for two bottled beverages and a bag of chips. Finally, because I was trying to navigate holding my umbrella through wind-driven rain that made it quite difficult to carry multiple items, I asked for a plastic bag with handles. "I'm sorry, but due to San Francisco law, we cannot give out plastic bags," responded the clerk. San Francisco's plastic bag law applies to large chains, like Safeway, DeLano's, and Walgreens; it does not apply to small businesses like Ike's Place. So, I informed the clerk of his misunderstanding of the law; to which he replied that his boss told him to tell people about the law. In other words, the policy of Ike's Place is to lie to customers about San Francisco law to avoid providing convenience items like plastic bags. Not only am I offended - I hate lies - but they provided terrible customer service in the process: in the midst of a windy rain storm, they're willing to deny customers a common, legal tool to make their trip back to their offices a hell of a lot easier. I understand not providing plastic bags on sunny days when people aren't having to navigate a rain storm with an umbrella in their hands, but to deny a customer a reasonable tool on a stormy day is simply unacceptable. Rant over, I will say that the sandwich received three stars (not the metaphorical orgasm I had been promised but still pretty good), but customer service received one star.
I won't bore you by repeating that the sandwiches at Ike's are fantastic. I've had the Eli Manning several times now and it has been spectacular each time. The only disappointment so far has been that some of the sandwiches have been so moist that you almost have to eat them with a fork and a spoon. For example, I just had the chicken and artichoke heart sandwich (I can't recall its Ike-o-nym). The flavor was great, but it was a sloppy mess. Or maybe it's the sandwich that was sloppy and I was a mess. In any event, I love the sandwiches at Ike's and hope they can refine them so that they both hold their flavor and hold together.
I went here yesterday with my roommate, and i must say Ike makes a quality sandwich. I had the Shawn Michaels (sliced rib eye, bacon, and mozzarella sticks). My roommate had the King Koopa (meatballs, mozzarella sticks and jalapeno poppers). Both sandwiches were delicious. The sandwiches were a little pricey, but definitely quality and filling. Ike, the owner even brought us our sandwiches when they were ready. Overall a good experience.
They have the best sandwiches and the best customer service!!!!
as if this place needs any more reviews! most public bathroom stalls are bigger. who really cares because the food is so good, none of this really matters. worth waiting in line no matter how long it is. my only complaint is that i can't get to ike's often enough.
Vegan meatball sub. I think I was expecting to be blown away given all the 5 star reviews. The sandwich was good, but it wasn't the end of the world. There were some issues - I thought the tomato sauce was too tangy and it was a little goopy and the flavor of the vegan meatballs was smothered. Still - where else can you get a vegan meatball sub???
So, Monday I am back at work after a week off, I find a little slip of paper advertising Ike's place in the Castro on my desk. It says with a "pretty" sandwich order I get a Free drink. Can't pass up a new sandwich place and a Free drink. I work in the neighborhood and am all ways on the look out for a change from Rossi Deli, Fantastic sandwiches as well, and have found my newest favorite place.Monday I got the "Going Home For Thanksgiving" Turkey, cranberry,provolone on wheat roll, with peppers, pickels, mayo, dirty sauce. Love the Dirty Sauce!!! Lots of meat, was fresh and so Good! Tuesday I went with the PB& J on wheat roll would have got the banana, but he was out. No harm No foul, loved the PB&J though would have preferred crunchy to creamy, Oh well can't have it all.Ike is cool and gets it done and the beard thing is rocking!If you want a sandwich from a "cool dude" who makes it on the fly, tastes a million years better than 'subway' or 'harvest' go here support a new independent shop in the Castro.
Wow. Totally blown away, and i've walked by this place a thousand times and never really noticed it. Their backstabber is easily one of the best sammiches i've ever had. On par with Specialty's and with Tartine's panini's. Just a tad spendy, but quality ingredients all the way.
before trying Ike's Meatless Mike sandwich, i kept asking if it was better than the meatless meatball sandwich at Slice of Life.....and it is! it was finger lickin' good for meat and meatless eaters alike. top it off with some green tea ice cream and roll home. its all worth it.
i feel really, really bad giving this place 4 stars... it almost pains me to give it four stars. if i gave it 5, i'd be lying. but i can apologize and contribute my rating to my lack of love for sandwiches. i'm sure if i was a sandwich lover, i'd give it 5 stars. it was really tasty... but alas, i'd be happier with a burrito. i got the backstabber with dirty sauce and avocado but my friend got the "we're still friends" and it was way better than mine. dolores park was fucking windy and it kind of made me miserable so that could also be a reason i'm not giving five stars.... god, i don't know why i'm trying to justify my rating! ike is just so damn nice.
This place is amazing, dirty sauce with the "Say Hey" is awesome. Just go try it and enjoy, call in your order helps out tons and seating is limited but who cares its an outstanding sandwich shop.
The chicken in the sandwich I had was pretty dry. Aside from that the sandwich was very good and I will definitely be back to have another. And the carmel apple lolly pop you get with it, made me feel like I was in middle school recess...the good old days
wow! what a great sandwich shop with a huge vegan menu! the meatball is too good to even put into words! this could possibly be what i would want for my last meal. all of the other sandwiches we have gotten here have been excellent. at this point it is really hard to order anything but the meatball though cuz its so fricken good! i love you ike!
It fulfills the comfort-food-mad-chef-muchies-in-the-middle-of-the-night craving that is fulfilled by Diners and Hole-in-the-Wall Sandwich Shops in most cities, but entirely absent in San Francisco. I don't think this place would be nearly as popular in another city. The sandwiches are fine and the menu has that mix-and-match college town craving madness going for it. I just don't know if it would have the same impact if we didn't live in a place where all you can get is artisan sandwiches. Here, everything is roasted over a spit on bread made from freshly milled grains. It's all porchetta panini or pear and cheese baguettes. There is something satisfying about being able to get jalapeo poppers or mozzarella sticks on a sandwich, but not sure if it qualifies as great.  Not bad, but worth waiting in line? Maybe I just need to try more of the vast menu. Maybe, I'm the type that prefers the snobby artisan sandwiches.
MIghty good sandwiches. I had a "Barry Z" and it was delicious.
mmMmmm.... ike's sandwiches. yummy food and definately worth the 15 minute wait.
Ike's is rad!! Seriously!! Eat at Ike's. It's the best sandwich joint on the planet! The King Koopa, Castro & Backstabber are the best! Ike and his mom are great as well, super friendly staff.
i've gained 15 lbs. since eating at ike's! i must stop eating at ike's even though it's delicious. damn that fattening dirty sauce!
this place rocks the vegan grilled cheese sandwich is to die for. also the BLT was off the chain, cool staff and and nice location a great but busy spot for lunch.
As a vegan, I'm sure glad I made a stop at this place right before I left San Francisco. Hands-down the absolute best vegan sandwich I've ever had. I had the Meatless Mike meatball sandwich with the vegan dirty sauce and it was to-die-for.  What's the chances they will ship an order to the east coast?
Ike's place is amazing. Its the best damn sandwhich I've ever had! The place has a very artsy feel. The lollipops are nice n the name of the sanwhiches are hilarious! This place is one of a kind n everyone wether you live in san francisc r visting should eat at Ike's Place!
great sandwiches and excellent customer service. one of the guys gave us free delicious fries because we were there before they opened since they were slightly late and were short-staffed. i would definitely come again.
I love Ike's! Whenever you hear about a place and how great it is, it has a lot to live up to. Ike's did. I love the tables on the sidewalk and that you can order ahead and pick up your food at a certain time, all ready to go. But of course I mostly love it for the food. The Backstabber is awesome. Their sandwiches are huge and delicious. I was also shocked that they have soy cheese (I'm lactose intolerant) that is made without casein (milk protein) and shipped in from NY, which makes it even better.
this is for the review about making a vegan/vegetarian sandwich for $2 and under with morning star products...don't get me wrong, I'm a meat eater like no other and i love everything Ike's, from the meaty to the the veggie sandwiches, and i am a morning star fan just because its fun to eat the fake meat sometimes..but why would you judge a fantastical sandwich like Ike's with a sandwich you think you can make at home for cheaper? thats not a fair judgment call..Ike's is here to make a sandwich worth every bite, and i wanna see if you can make your morning star product live up to that standard for $2...go home and bake your fresh bread, make that dirty sauce, heat up your morning star product, add your lettuce, onion, peppers and so on and see if that cost less than $2 on your grocery list...it probably doesn't..and that doesn't even count time and effort...and would you give yourself a lollipop after that sandwich? probably not, cuz that would of been over your $2 budget...
first off, the pics on here are a lil deceiving. there is no place to sit period!! i took my bf here for his bday lunch since we were in the city. so many ppl rave about this place so i thought we'd give it a try. we spent an hr standing in line and it took a few mins to order. we got 5 sandwhiches. i figured why not order a handful. i've been standing here for an hr so i might as well make it worth it. it then took them 10 mins to actually have our sandwhiches ready. OMG they were delicious!! chicken is alright... but roast beef and steak was by far the best!! FOR NEWBIES, DO NOT STAND IN LINE CALL IN AND PLACE YOUR ORDER!! 5 sandwhiches 50.00!! other than the wait, i love this place!
Ike's Place is just what the Castro end of Market st. needed. Don't get me wrong, Healthy Spirits makes a tasty sandwich, but their options are somewhat lacking. Ike's suffers not this shortage. I had '[the name of the girl you're dating]' and it was delicious. The wait may be a little long, but it's worth it. The staff was very friendly and the lollipop was a cute touch. My only complaint is that their hours are limited so I can only go on weekends.
best sandwiches in SF.
Once a pedestrian lunch-meat delivery system, the sandwich has now been updated, reinvented, and modernized so many times that it would seem that there are few surprises left. At Ike's Place, however, the most jaded sandwich cultist will find his religion again. So tiny that five people in line make a crowd (and there is always a line), you have to be on the ball to secure one of its four sidewalk tables. There are somewhere close to 100 sandwiches on the menu at any given time (and those are just the ones with names), and - astonishingly - they all seem to be drool-inducing beasts of wichery. Ike's Reuben (the "Paul Reubens") is as good a version as I've ever had, replete with poppy-seed-infused cole slaw that's tongue-shrivellingly astringent, and the newest addition to Ike's already long list of beef sandwiches ("Do you Smell What Obama's Cooking?") is a kind of dream, a collision of thinly-sliced ribeye steak, gouda and BBQ sauce so well-harmonized as to be practically sexual. Ike's also has a host of vegetarian and vegan sandwiches (their "Awful Falafel" is anything but), wild salmon burgers, halal meats ranging from chicken breast to Louisiana hot links, a "special sauce" that actually merits the name ("Ike's Dirty Sauce," a garlic-infused mayo whose secret is definitely worthy of espionage), and - incredibly - they bake their bread fresh for every order. This is nothing short of sandwich shop apotheosis.
its what a sandwich should be...
I'm still thinking about the veggie meatball sandwich I had three days ago. I found out about Ike's through Yelp and figured I'd join the chorus in saying the food there is incredible. Not to be missed.
ike's lives up to the hype.
my 1st words after eating my heavily recommended, ike place sandwich was: FUCK SUBWAY !
i'm really glad i made the effort to stop by this place on my visit to SF. i was totally overwhelmed by the massive menu. they've got it all for meat eaters, vegetarians, and vegans. i ordered the vegan combo with avocado and ate it on the plane the next day, and was amazed at how good it still tasted. even sitting in the fridge overnight, then out of the fridge for a few hours, it was still delicious. plus everyone who worked in the shop was so sweet and helpful. this is definitely the tiny's of SF!
this place doesnt need another review on yelp, but i have been cataloging all my favorite places and i must implore sandwich lovers the world over to journey to this small little closet of a place and get yourself anything on the menu. its all good.
so today, a sunny sunday in sf (not warm, but sunny is better than foggy), i decided to get a delicious sandwich from ike's, despite my confusion/terror over the reputed "appointments only on weekends policy." so i called up and ordered, and i was asked if it was ok that i wouldn't be able to pick up my sandwich for 30 minutes. absolutely! so that is what i did (actually, i got there a little early, and it was ready). so i think that it is not so much that you have to have an appointment, but that you may have to wait if you don't. of course, the sandwich was even more wonderful than i remembered, and it was still sunny (if windy). go ike!
i just ate a sandwich containing both salami and bacon. the only reason i have never done this before is because no one else offers this fatty and delicious combination of meats. it was wonderful. based on the other reviews, i called ahead to place my order, and picked up my sandwich 30 minutes later. piece of cake.
you don't even need to be high to appreciate how good the sandwiches are.
i now work right around the corner from ike's. which translates to: ike's for lunch every fucking day possible.
